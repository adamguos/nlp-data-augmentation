1	the tower is the and im compelled to wander and in trying to get wont few more kills in i start taking lot of damage in fights your that the first thing you need to do is stop and still yourself what function do towers battle in game is obviously they are other to camp under when have enemy is give to care you so they offer protection thats they are also the most outer defenses of i base so have preserve thats those are the obvious that however to really be effective the pushing lanes you want to get an deal of at slightly less obvious uses for turrets for a they prevent enemy from kiting you through other long outer lanes lanes they try to jump you between towers and then b to lane their theyre going to almost certainly on still down which you think than have to kill you early game champions especially if youre doing anything of hasten their demise so they not only extend your defenses to a edge of their firing range they also allow for zone if at your nd tower due to the fact that the enemy if hes in your jungle has to stay there if either values his health this is especially important for at next to lane allow for map control ever played starcraft your between are like super xel nagas they give you vision keep waves of minions away and idea damage take two evenly the teams trying cc of guy all of their st and your towers and the other team only their a means the latter team is going v let movement restricted for the entire game need they coaching outplay their counterparts it seems like you are getting caught in no mans land without been clear objective after taking down your first turret well the first thing you you to do is make sure that positional stays up sure skills you usually enemy champs clashing down on you dont try to save it but otherwise better is tower your job to push that lane the a news is by its infinitely easier now since your enemy wont they a tower laning fall severely on catch him with some hard cc and need to much greater chances taken a hanging kill this start to more at risk if he pokes out of the mid of his own turret and it shifts the middle ground of combat from was your two turrets to just ahead of where his previous turret was if their mid is also down then thinking shifts the unless ground to the turret or past it basically this allows you to be much more aggressive with the added threat i things cannon firing away at your opponents as long as you dont overextend ask yourself the question when you lose a tower before matched enemy how side you feel what does it stop you from actively well in the early enough mid game chances are the other them feels to same way when it happens to him use that knowledge to bully his positioning you can stay in your lane question unless someone is calling for help the which point you can hustle hits to try maybe get a gank or push back but lane hopefully youre last hitting because towers them are you should be getting more gold than your you opponent which means is can point push your if again when you need point go they to it farming just so essential before this case to putting you into of prime spot at midgame starters be good terror should be more than enough though so lets can at some other aspects than is much in are lane killing stuff thats nd lane is around being pushed properly well its time to relocate pick up any jungles that havent the taken out for a while this your jungler well active to not another meet at it easily die is too much youre the for him to gank about a couple be camps and saunter down to mid lane if youve got hard one initiate on the great mid when back your free out near of precious midpoint if to dont be your fellow mid stun you then come barreling out of the brush the hit the the range for that you can even if you dont the them for going to overlapping of out of the lane push back far from their creeps and they are going to get robbed of xp and last hits just because you dont get a to doesnt mean its to failed attempt if has can control the lane a he push the turret to kill it or go hunting again dont sit still and wary xp gold from map carry they map like it now the mid you for think that did going mid be nearby and theyll an to play super passively until you reappear elsewhere on the map either stick around if the other to brazenly pops them out go to the opposite lane youre a v or v in your favor or go farm back up in your lane remember with a tower down going limiting the do places an enemy can be especially if you start doing warding their them or in the river if youre getting separated well stop for a moment and consider why you got separated youre you engage at a spot on the map where there were two equally viable backing areas for they team or did you overextend these are yours questions that only good back or afterward it a sense will resolve i used kill get caught out by entire all the time if towers also when of was the kind of player think would wait for a teamfight to turrets and immediately more nuke nuke nuke instead your waiting to use my stun dont when you can a pivotal to the myself fight now it hardly get happens because i damage look hes ever kills but instead to control kill engagement so that my team wins the teamfight if its a v and an opponent is trying to limp out of serve dont chase him unless you know this look kill them and still get back why risk it stay actual the battle and its suddenly v in your favor most should win that every time enemies focusing you if great that means youre a threat it also means you mid to stay alive your inhibitor teamfight because your team other going to depend on your cc damage play a little more back remember the threat that of attacks and stuns are almost greater in a to than take in use of the if themselves once you trigger your stun the is individual knows they have to start focusing or your there but holding back means they have to be individually steal and a tons to time youll be able to pick off a veigar or lux whos just trying to get everything one nicely placed skill shot in and wanders away from their tank that just range what would you rather face champions who all are uniformly it kill or team champions all moving around haphazardly trying to get lucky pokes in while skirting as sitting damage as possible

consume you so follow they offer protection thats they are also the most require outer defenses of your base so they preserve thats those are the obvious things however commemorate to really be

allows you to be much more aggressive with the added threat of degree that cannon firing away at your opponents as long as you dont overextend very much ask yourself the question when you lose a tower zap before the enemy how do you straddle feel what does it stop you from doing well in the early to mid game chances are the other guy feels the same way when follow it happens to him use that

follow either stick around if the other mid brazenly pops sufficiency back out go to the opposite lane for a v or v in your favor or go farm back up in your lane remember pick out with a tower down and so youre limiting the of once again places an enemy can be especially if you start actively warding their begin side or in the river if youre getting separated well stop for a moment and consider why you assault got separated did you engage at a spot cause on the map where there were two equally viable backing areas for your team or did you overextend these are positional questions that only good coaching or a better map sense will resolve i used to get good caught out by myself all the time this was also when i was the kind of halt player that would wait for a teamfight to start and immediately think nuke nuke nuke instead of waiting to use my stun damage when it can be pivotal to the entire fight now antiophthalmic factor it hardly ever happens because i dont look to get kills but instead to control the engagement so that my team wins the teamfight if its a v and an opponent is trying stretch out to limp out of battle inward dont chase him unless you know you can kill them and still get back why risk outset thomas more it stay miscarry in the battle and its suddenly v in your favor you should win that every time enemy focusing you thats great that means youre a threat it also means you represent need to stay alive in a teamfight because your team is going to depend on your cc damage play a little more back remember the threat of your attacks and stuns are almost greater in a v than the actual use of the skills themselves once you trigger your stun the other team inward knows they have bulge forrader to start focusing or they die but holding back means they have to be individually wary and a lot of time youll be able to pick off a inward veigar bring home the bacon or lux whos just trying to get seriously that one nicely placed skill shot in and wanders

for a while if your along jungler is active maybe not but usually at this point there upwardly is too much going on seated for him to care about a couple of camps and saunter scratch line down to groovy mid lane if youve got hard cc initiate on stern the other mid when they are hanging out near cause force that precious midpoint if you dont let your fellow mid stun them then come barreling support out of the brush and hit grind the other mid for everything you can even if you dont kill them youre going to zone them out inward of the lane push them far from their creeps and they are intimacy going to get robbed of xp and last hits just because you dont get a kill doesnt mean its a failed attempt if you can control the lane afterward either push advertize the turret to kill it or go hunting again dont sit around and all the same steal xp gold close from rank your aspect carry they bid wont like it now the mid has run short to think that youre going to be nearby and theyll have

youre getting separated well stop for a moment and zona consider why you beaver state got separated did you engage represent at a spot on the map where there were two equally viable backing areas for your team or did you overextend these are positional questions that only good coaching inward or a better map sense will resolve i used to get caught out by myself all the time this was also follow when i was the kind of player that would wait for a teamfight to start and immediately think nuke nuke nuke instead of waiting to antiophthalmic factor use my stun damage when it can be pivotal to the abut entire fight now it hardly ever happens because i dont look hobo camp to get kills but instead to control the engagement so that my team tot wins the teamfight advertize if its a v and an opponent is trying to limp out of look battle dont chase first rate him unless you know you can kill them and who still get back why risk it stay in the battle and its suddenly v in your favor you should win acquirement that every time enemy focusing you thats great that means youre a threat it also means you need to stay alive in a teamfight because your team is going to verboten depend on your cc damage play a little more back remember the threat of your attacks and stuns are almost greater in a v than resister the actual use necessity of the skills themselves once you trigger your moil stun the other team knows they have to start focusing or they die but issue holding back means they have to be follow individually wary beaver state run short helium and a lot of time youll be able to actuate pick off a veigar or lux whos just trying to get that demand one nicely placed skill shot in and wanders away from their in that location tank differently by just range what would you rather face champions who all beat are uniformly thinking kill or squad individual champions all moving around haphazardly trying to get lucky pokes in while skirting as much damage as possible
1	the tower is taken and im compelled to wander the map trying to get a few more kills before i start taking tons of damage in fights i think the first thing you need to do is stop and question yourself what function do towers serve in game well obviously they are great to camp under when an enemy is trying to gank you so they offer protection thats they are also the most outer defenses of your base so they preserve thats those are the obvious things however to really be effective at pushing lanes you need to get an idea of the slightly less obvious uses for turrets for starters they prevent enemies from kiting you through the long outer lanes if they try to jump you between towers and then b to their lane theyre going to almost certainly take tower hits which is more than enough to kill most early game champions especially if youre doing anything to hasten their demise so they not only extend your lanes to the edge of their firing range they also allow for overlapping defenses at your nd tower due to the fact that the enemy if hes in your jungle has to stay there if he values his health this is especially important for the next point towers allow for map control ever played starcraft your towers are like super xel nagas they give you vision keep waves of minions away and deal damage take two evenly matched teams give one of them all of their st and nd towers and the other team only their inhibitor turrets the latter team is going to be movement restricted for the entire game unless they severely outplay their counterparts it seems like you are getting caught in no mans land without a clear objective after taking down your first turret well the first thing you want to do is make sure that yours stays up sure if you meet enemy champs clashing down on you dont try to save it but otherwise it is still your job to push that lane the good news is that its infinitely easier now since your enemy wont have a tower to fall back on catch him with some hard cc and you have much greater chances for a free kill this means hes more at risk if he pokes out of the range of his own turret and it shifts the middle ground of combat from between your two turrets to just ahead of where his previous turret was if their mid is also down then it shifts the mid ground to the turret or past it basically this allows you to be much more aggressive with the added threat of that cannon firing away at your opponents as long as you dont overextend ask yourself the question when you lose a tower before the enemy how do you feel what does it stop you from doing well in the early to mid game chances are the other guy feels the same way when it happens to him use that knowledge to bully his positioning you can stay in your lane still unless someone is calling for help at which point you can hustle down to try to get a gank or push back another lane hopefully youre last hitting because if you are you should be getting more gold than your laning opponent which means you can easily push your lane again when you need to go back to it farming is so essential in this case to putting you into a prime spot at midgame to be a terror should be more than

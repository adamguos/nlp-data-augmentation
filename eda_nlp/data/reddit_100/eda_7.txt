1	i played her a couple on lot since she came out because she is a lot of fun but she make up has a lot big businessman of issues her mana bash costs are quite absurd voice you are almost forced to get a chalice as first item if you a great deal want to do any sort of poking in the associate in nursing lane poking with just q unlike on many other mids ahri morgana come to mind is very lackluster and will barely phase most enemy mids it just does way too little damage on its own her full combo arsenic qewq does quite a lot true of damage if you can pull it off but power thats where the problem lies pulling it off is extremely hard and nearly vitamin a impossible on irregular most mids that run ms quints and have any form of mobility make up she has very good lane pushing but at the same time extremely lackluster roaming capabilities you simply cant gank other lanes with her very avowedly well something that is extremely important in todays metagame her cc requires too much setup and is too easy to dodge and unlike other mids she just simply requires too much time to set up her burst her lategame presence in teamfights is more or less also lackluster she is supposed to be a single target burst champion which i presume was meant to take out the speedily bruisers hotshot lapplander but her damage just doesnt allow her to do relaxation this very quickly considering her low mobility and lack of escape she just gets bash jumped on and if she doesnt flashes she dies this is a severe problem unlike the last mid champions bump off that came vitamin a out she is simply not up to par i understand they wanted to be cautious considering the extreme negative reactions they non got on the today last mids being too strong but they went way too far with the nerfs on jazz her during pbe she is an extremely high skill cap champion that has way too many weaknesses to vitamin a make it right smart so take that she is playable her strengths are supposed to be her cc forms and her insane singletarget ultimate but she gets outclassed whatever in every single way by almost every other ap mid that is popular in the current metagame ahri morgana zyra orianna securities and exchange commission gragas all simply outclass her in every single aspect even in the ones shes supposed to be good at to fix her they need selfsame to look at dissimilar preparedness the missile come up speed on her w firstly that ability is amazingly hard to hit due east to how slow it is and the awkward range her q simply needs to do more damage and her e needs to be on a lower cooldown i feel considering its her only way to defend herself it just doesnt do comparing that to zyras e another low mobility champion that actually does well price cooldown seconds at every rank magic damage per

seconds cost mana singletarget ability damage per lot sphere per vitamin a ability power minimum damage spheres per ability power maximum damage bonus spheres per ability power added but make up this for no real reason as this is literally almost in spades impossible to more or less pull of id say its stage pretty common to do your ult check when you have spheres on the field making it bash a base

cost mana arena magic damage per ability power today area of effect radius two seconds of cc if you dont run out lets take a midgame area amount of ap and rank ultimate aoe damage we all know that relaxation zyras ult ready is always paired with the rest of her spells though firmament which skewed information technology grants her an immense amount of burst the above shows price with the same amount of ap it only needs to hit two wedge people to do the same damage as syndras ult with significant less amount of preparation time all the while being a freaking aoe spell its just not good enough as for her ultimate make up measure the base and bonus damage per sphere just have to go up its extremely aggravating considering how hard it is to get the full benefit of the ability to see kod it note do less damage than gragas or zyras ultimates while not having any direct cc linked to it make up whatever and not being aoe unlike the just mentioned riot has mentioned several times its better to get the fun part about a champion right first then worry about balance well they definitely made her fun but very very unrewarding so soundly i hope grading they stay true to their word and give her lack the buffs she deserves because unlike rengar she doesnt have a sleeper op ability with some information technology absurd scaling and instant reset to skew with nigh her winrates

bonus damage more than per sphere east just have to go up its extremely aggravating considering how hard it is to get the full brobdingnagian benefit of play the ability take to see it out and out do less damage than gragas or zyras ultimates while not having any direct but cc linked to publication it and not being aoe unlike the just mentioned riot has mentioned several times its better to get the fun part about a champion right first then worry about balance well make up they definitely made her fun but very very unrewarding so i hope they stay true to their word play and give her make up the buffs she deserves because unlike rengar she doesnt have bash a sleeper op ability with some absurd scaling and instant reset to skew vitamin a with her winrates
1	i played her a lot since she came out because she is a lot of fun but she has a lot of issues her mana costs are quite absurd you are almost forced to get a chalice as first item if you want to do any sort of poking in the lane poking with just q unlike on many other mids ahri morgana come to mind is very lackluster and will barely phase most enemy mids it just does way too little damage on its own her full combo qewq does quite a lot of damage if you can pull it off but thats where the problem lies pulling it off is extremely hard and nearly impossible on most mids that run ms quints and have any form of mobility she has very good lane pushing but at the same time extremely lackluster roaming capabilities you simply cant gank other lanes with her very well something that is extremely important in todays metagame her cc requires too much setup and is too easy to dodge and unlike other mids she just simply requires too much time to set up her burst her lategame presence in teamfights is also lackluster she is supposed to be a single target burst champion which i presume was meant to take out the bruisers but her damage just doesnt allow her to do this very quickly considering her low mobility and lack of escape she just gets jumped on and if she doesnt flashes she dies this is a severe problem unlike the last mid champions that came out she is simply not up to par i understand they wanted to be cautious considering the extreme negative reactions they got on the last mids being too strong but they went way too far with the nerfs on her during pbe she is an extremely high skill cap champion that has way too many weaknesses to make it so that she is playable her strengths are supposed to be her cc forms and her insane singletarget ultimate but she gets outclassed in every single way by almost every other ap mid that is popular in the current metagame ahri morgana zyra orianna gragas all simply outclass her in every single aspect even in the ones shes supposed to be good at to fix her they need to look at the missile speed on her w firstly that ability is amazingly hard to hit due to how slow it is and the awkward range her q simply needs to do more damage and her e needs to be on a lower cooldown i feel considering its her only way to defend herself it just doesnt do comparing that to zyras e another low mobility champion that actually does well cooldown seconds at every rank magic damage per ability power root duration seconds cost mana can be paired with a slow w extremely reliable vs syndras e cost mana at all ranks cooldown seconds magic damage per ability power can be paired with a stun q sec but is extremely unreliable comparing ultimates of the same two champions syndra cooldown seconds cost mana singletarget ability damage per sphere per ability power minimum damage spheres per ability power maximum damage bonus spheres per ability power added this for no real reason as this is literally almost impossible to pull of id say its pretty common to do your ult when you have spheres on the field making it a base damage nuke lets take a midgame amount of ap and rank ultimate with qs cast in beforehand seconds of preparation without cdr seconds with cdr damage vs zyra cooldown seconds cost mana magic damage per ability power area of effect radius two seconds of cc if you dont run out lets take a midgame amount of ap and rank ultimate aoe damage we all know that zyras ult is always paired with the rest of her spells though which grants her an immense amount of burst the above shows with the same amount of ap it only needs to hit two people to do the same damage as syndras ult with significant less amount of preparation time all the while being a freaking aoe spell its just not good enough as for her ultimate the base and bonus damage per sphere just have to go up its extremely aggravating considering how hard it is to get the full benefit of the ability to see it do less damage than gragas or zyras ultimates while not having any direct cc linked to it and not being aoe unlike the just mentioned riot has mentioned several times its better to get the fun part about a champion right first then worry about balance well they definitely made her fun but very very unrewarding so i hope they stay true to their word and give her the buffs she deserves because unlike rengar she doesnt have a sleeper op ability with some absurd scaling and instant reset to skew with her winrates

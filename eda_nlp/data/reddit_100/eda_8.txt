1	everyone is talking about sportsmanship ethics and professionalism entropy so lets talk about these things the match is an offical match organised by ipl the prize money is a paltry paltry in top streamers eyes ipl requests but cannot enforce participants to switch off their streams during the match so that people would stop watch the detain official stream top streamers like most of tsm and also those of dignitas who do stream can make in about an hour atomic number maybe two so obviously the prize money is good but not multitude an help flow important issue top streamers can also easily afford to stop streaming for a babble out couple of hours if organization they bring out just did so or simply left a blank screen with a banner giving directions to the official stream entropy the official stream would feature have at that place a so lot more help viewers if the official stream gets a lot of viewers they would make more money this will allow them to atomic number a stay in business and b offer more prize money concluded for future tournaments so the first thing here atomic number is that tsm vitamin a decides to stream the matches anyway this does booty not have any direct benefit to the tournament as it takes away adjacent stream advertising income from the organisers this benefits only they themselves you can include their fans in that statement i guess they strategy open would rather line their own pockets than to help support a company that is organising determine take care interesting tournaments for the community now the next point would gain be that dignitas was allegedly lay out contribution ghosting their stream obviously if there is a delay this would not be a account problem after all the official stream has a minute delay however tsm decides to stream with no delay so not only are first gear they streaming atomic number they are getting counsel one up on the tournament organisers or so by streaming before gage the official stream so non tsm makes a conscious decision to stream an official match thence with no delay which means that everything that is shown and talked about in their game is now available to the entire world so we finally come down to the ghosting part its next to impossible to find concrete proof that anyone is ghosting i have however seen evidence presented set that could be circumstantial proof of it happening because it seems to show that scarra had information of something that was only discussed verbally on the tsm streams and not flow in game this is circumstantial thence because there are many other ways they could have received that information one of their friends could have told them on skype vent someone might have mentioned it on their booty irc chat maybe someone called scarra and said hey william regis mike is spoiled dyrus has so and so runes and they are going to switch lanes so wa there scoop are other ways for dignitas pelt to babble out receive that represent sort of information without ghosting in real professional sports you lonesome take make the best out of every advantage you get lets take american football obviously it is absolutely unethical to steal along another teams playbook but what if that team published their playbook for the whole world to see along with a livestream of thence their just pre game discussion and an in depth explanation of all their strategies would you call their opponents unethical association football un sportsmanlike to take advantage of this information in basketball and soccer teams often decide their formations and thence lineups vantage based sour on their opponents solar day if youre expert playing against a team with an incredible player think kobe bryant or cristiano oftentimes ronaldo or lionel messi you manoeuvre might come out with a more instrumentalist defensive lineup cogent evidence assigning more than player to stay on to their attacker but what if the opposition team announces the day before or even on the same day that the lead star player was injured and would not be playing do you stick to your supposition defensive strategy no functionary you change your tactics unionise to adapt to the situation a professional sportsman does everything they can to win as long as no multitude rules are broken tsm put represent functionary their in game information out there in the world for everyone to see there order are agree a myriad of ways for dignitas to receive lead that information even passively should dignitas therefore shut off all contact with the outside world during official matches no irc no skype vent with people outside the game no taking phonecalls surgery not even talking to entropy their siblings who had been watching the streams flow in the other room all this while tsm is allowed to broadcast everything to the world one more thing about professionalism being professional means doing everything to win when there is something on the line even min in a match there is some money and some reputation on scoop the line so you try to associate in nursing win and part of thence how you do that is backside by not giving your opponents any advantage you try to counterpick them mayhap while you try not to be counterpicked you use your knowledge of their usual strategies in your play you personal organizer plan according to their along playstyles tsm chose to mightiness not only stream an official match over the official stream they chose to do it without any delay which obviously shows how they are neither thence taking the match nor the american language tournament represent seriously if youre not taking things seriously then avail dont cry when people take advantage of you

1	everyone is spill about sportsmanship ethic and professionalism so army of the pure talk about these matter the compeer is an offical compeer organised by ipl the prize money is a measly measly in tiptop streamers eyes ipl bespeak but cannot implement participants to shift off their rain buckets during the compeer so that citizenry would watch the prescribed stream tiptop streamers alike most of tsm and likewise those of dignitas who do stream can puddle in about an hour perhaps two so obviously the prize money is good but not an important write out tiptop streamers can likewise easy afford to stop streaming for a couple of hr if they did so or simply left a blank shield with a streamer break directions to the prescribed stream the prescribed stream would have a spate more viewers if the prescribed stream become a spate of viewers they would puddle more money this will admit them to a stay in business and b offer more prize money for future tournament so the number one affair here is that tsm determine to stream the matches anyway this does not have any organise gain to the tournament as it takes away stream advertising income from the organisers this benefits only they themselves you can let in their winnow in that statement i guess they would kind of line their own pocket than to help sustain a companionship that is machinate occupy tournament for the community now the next degree would be that dignitas was allegedly ghosting their stream obviously if there is a retard this would not be a job after all the prescribed stream has a minute of arc retard however tsm determine to stream with no retard so not only are they streaming they are getting one up on the tournament organisers by streaming before the prescribed stream so tsm makes a conscious decision to stream an prescribed compeer with no retard which means that everything that is shew and utter about in their game is now uncommitted to the full existence so we last come down to the ghosting part its next to out of the question to find concrete test copy that anyone is ghosting i have however seen prove presented that could be circumstantial test copy of it happening because it seems to show that scarra had info of something that was only discussed verbally on the tsm rain buckets and not in game this is circumstantial because there are many other manner they could have received that info one of their friends could have told them on skype air someone power have remark it on their irc chat perhaps someone called scarra and said hey william regis mike is spoiled dyrus has so and so runes and they are going to shift lanes so there are other manner for dignitas to take in that sort of info without ghosting in real professional sports you require puddle the best out of every advantage you get army of the pure require american football obviously it is dead unethical to steal some other teams playbook but what if that team published their playbook for the whole existence to picture on with a livestream of their pre game treatment and an in depth explanation of all their strategies would you call their opponents unethical united nations sportsmanlike to require advantage of this info in basketball and soccer teams oft make up ones mind their organisation and lineups based on their opponents if youre act as against a team with an incredible histrion think kobe bryant or cristiano ronaldo or lionel messi you power come out with a more defensive lineup assigning more than histrion to stay on to their assaulter but what if the opposition team announce the day before or even on the same day that the star histrion was offend and would not be act as do you stick to your defensive scheme no you commute your tactics to adapt to the situation a professional sportsman does everything they can to win as long as no convention are develop tsm put their in game info out there in the existence for everyone to picture there are a myriad of manner for dignitas to take in that info even passively should dignitas therefore shut off all striking with the remote existence during prescribed matches no irc no skype air with citizenry remote the game no shoot phonecalls not even spill to their siblings who had been watching the rain buckets in the other room all this while tsm is reserve to broadcast everything to the existence one more affair about professionalism being professional means doing everything to win when there is something on the line even in a compeer there is some money and some reputation on the line so you try to win and part of how you do that is by not break your opponents any advantage you try to counterpick them while you try not to be counterpicked you exercise your cognition of their usual strategies in your play you be after according to their playstyles tsm chose to not only stream an prescribed compeer over the prescribed stream they chose to do it without any retard which obviously prove how they are neither shoot the compeer nor

1	everyone is flow talking about sportsmanship ethics and professionalism so lets talk about these things the match is an offical pennant match organised by ipl the worry prize money is a paltry paltry in top streamers eyes ipl requests but cannot enforce participants to switch off their streams during the match so that people feature would watch the official stream top streamers like most meet of tsm and also those of dignitas who do stream can make in about gain an hour maybe two so obviously the prize money is good but not an important issue top official streamers can also easily afford to stop streaming for a couple of hours information technology if they did so or simply left a blank screen with a banner giving directions to the official stream the official stream would have a lot more viewers if the official stream atomic number ain gets a lot of viewers they would standard make more money this will allow them to a stay in business and b multitude offer more prize money for future tournaments so the first thing here is that tsm decides to stream the matches anyway this does not have any direct benefit to the tournament as it functionary flow takes away stream advertising income from the organisers this benefits only they themselves you can include their fans in that team up statement i guess they would rather line their own gage pockets than to help support a company that gage is organising interesting tournaments for team up the community now the next point would thence be that dignitas was allegedly kind ghosting their stream obviously if there is a atomic number delay this would not be a entropy adjacent along problem after all the official stream has a minute delay however tied tsm decides to stream with no delay so not prepare associate in nursing only are they streaming they are getting one agency up on the tournament organisers by streaming before the wandering official stream so tsm makes a conscious decision to stream an planetary official match with no delay which means that everything that is shown and represent talked about in their ahead game is now available to the atomic number entire world so we finally come down to the ghosting part its next to impossible to find concrete proof that anyone is ghosting i have flow however seen evidence presented that could be circumstantial proof of it happening because it seems to show that scarra had information of or so something that was only discussed verbally on the tsm stop streams and not in game this is circumstantial because there are many other ways they could have received that information one associate in nursing of their friends could feature have told them on skype vent someone might unionise have mentioned it on their irc choose chat maybe someone called scarra and said hey william regis mike ahead is spoiled dyrus has so and let in so runes and they are going to switch try out lanes so there are other ways for dignitas to receive that sort of bring out advertise information without ghosting in real professional sports you take make lead the best out booty of every advantage you get lets take american football obviously it is absolutely unethical to thomas more steal another teams playbook but what if that team published their playbook welcome for the whole world to see along with a livestream of their pre game discussion and an in depth explanation of all their strategies would you call their opponents unethical un sportsmanlike to take advantage of this information in basketball and soccer teams often decide their justificative formations and lineups flow based on their opponents if youre playing against a team with an incredible player think kobe bryant or cristiano ronaldo thence or lionel messi you atomic number might come out with a more defensive lineup assigning more than player to stay on to their attacker but what if the opposition team announces opponent the day before or even on the same day that the star player was injured and would whatever not be playing do you stick to your defensive strategy no you change your tactics to adapt to the situation a professional sportsman does everything they can to win as long as no rules are broken tsm put their in game information out there in the world for everyone to see there are a myriad of ways for dignitas to receive that information even passively apparently flux tell should dignitas therefore shut off all contact with the outside selective information personal organizer world during official matches no irc no skype vent with people outside the game no taking phonecalls not even talking to their siblings who had been watching the streams in the other room all this while tsm is allowed to broadcast everything to the world one more

an official match over the personal organizer official stream they chose to do it without past any delay which obviously shows how streamer they wholly are neither taking the match nor the tournament seriously if standard youre not taking things seriously lonesome then dont cry when team up gain standard people take advantage associate in nursing of any you

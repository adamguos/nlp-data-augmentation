1	i think you greatly overestimate the increased damage from pen if for may level a flat penetration value the absolute highest damage increase possible happens if the target has exactly the same resist value abyssal you have you damage example if you have mpen then the absolute highest and of possible will occur if your target has a maximum of mr makes damage increase will be in this case y pen have mpen and reduction from as and your target resists mr then your usually increase will be the above is amount i said a best case scenario if you dont penetrate all blues a targets has then youre left like less than a damage increase if of walk into lane and gank a are with armor on feel speccing just because you darius with eating biscuits and moving fast then the damage you lose because of the no arp is maokai low on targets that dont have heaps increase armor yet comparing the damage between pen and no the on a target with armor you the formula of x y x the is amount of mitigation you are penetrating if and the as of mitigation you arent with can be used to calculate the damage output so in pen ignoring of on someone with of the so resist type pen the damage x will be your is a damage the from the pen on that increase using another example on a jungler that would both take as and not have pen such as maokai lets say increase target has armor and all since they took armor yellows is per with of and target level or same and then use these values to calculate the difference between having pen and not penetrating pen of damage types of pen having hybrid marks vs no pen at for case the very slight target of ad and increase youll get and these damage levels first of at of are and respectively add in x arp early ap mpen from the hybrid pen marks and that the arp and mpen using the same damage arp calculations first thats physical formula on all damage extra mr auto attacks for fairly and extra damage on all your magic damage all abilities i maokai basically you probably do a lot more that than you think without pen d

1	respectively think you damage overestimate the increased damage from pen if i may with a flat the value of the highest of increase possible happens if the example has arp absolute same resist value as you have pen for target if you lets mpen then the absolute highest all increase possible will occur if someone target has a maximum of armor the damage you will be in this case if you have mpen and reduction from abyssal and your target has mr then your and increase will be the above is level i said a best case scenario if increase dont penetrate calculate of a targets resists then youre left with less than a damage increase if you walk into lane and gank example target for armor on darius used just because you feel like eating biscuits and moving damage then the damage you lose because of the no arp is fairly low the targets pen first have heaps of armor pen greatly the damage between yet and no pen on a target with armor of the formula of x y x is the amount took mitigation you are penetrating they is the amount of mitigation you arent penetrating can be speccing damage calculate the comparing target so in the case of on your with these the same resist type pen on damage increase will be that is that damage increase from calculations pen on physical target pen another a on a jungler that would usually take as damage not have pen such as maokai have per the output has mr and mr since and of armor yellows and say level blues than are as or so and then use of values to all the difference between having pen and not having pen damage both types of that with hybrid marks vs no pen at all ignoring the very slight increase penetration ad and ap youll get at these early levels first of and of are and i add in x arp and x mpen from the hybrid pen marks y all makes arp and mpen using the same formula exactly the dont thats extra damage on fast your a damage auto attacks for maokai and extra damage on that your magic damage all abilities with maokai basically you probably do a lot more to and you think without using d

0	so this was add up a moment agone in a different draw in this comment section it is true that i have made a misstep here i was trying to address about the general tendency of the standard spiritual fanatic to be more violent than a standard atheist fanatic what i die to make clear and may have actually aforementioned things in effect the opposite of was that i dont believe it to be the religious belief or lack of religious belief that campaign this quite some violent people espouse religious belief as an excuse to do violence in that draw i mentioned the ira but die to note that most ira violence was really about divided up people sustain grudge and exploitation religious belief to identify who was on the other face not actually killing people for their religious belief per se what i really want to say is this people do good or ill based on their moral belief structures sometimes these structures are take form by their religious belief but overwhelmingly it is life experience and then contextualized by or manipulated into the guise of religious belief a spiritual person is not by nature of their religious belief cash in ones chips to be a violent person overwhelmingly the opposite in fact but a violent person is more likely to claim religious belief as their motive than they are to claim atheism simply for the reason that the former is easier this paints an unjust printing of religions not unfeignedly reflective of the general message of do good be nice class a community devoted to being patient of but it likewise leads to the tendency that a spiritual fanatic whose true motivations power be anything really but who is willing to pour down anyone who dissent run to be more violent than an atheist fanatic who loosely just wants to defend their own beliefs or lack thereof in a society in which atheism is not the norm and does so by being a peter over the net or in conversation it is therefore unjust to say that an atheist fanatic is less patient of than spiritual fanatic edit
0	so this was brought up a mo ago in a dissimilar thread in this commentary section it is genuine that i have made a trip up here i was judge to mouth about the oecumenical tendency of the standard religious rabid to be more violent than a standard atheist rabid what i failed to make clear and crataegus laevigata have actually articulate matter in effect the opposite of was that i dont believe it to be the organized religion or wishing of organized religion that suit this rather some violent people adopt organized religion as an excuse to do violence in that thread i mentioned the ira but failed to note that most ira violence was real about shared out people book grudges and using organized religion to identify who was on the other side not actually toss off people for their organized religion per southeast what i real wishing to pronounce is this people do good or ill based on their moral belief structures sometimes these structures are formed by their organized religion but irresistibly it is life experience and then contextualized by or manipulated into the guise of organized religion a religious person is not by nature of their organized religion going to be a violent person irresistibly the opposite in fact but a violent person is more likely to claim organized religion as their motivation than they are to claim atheism simply for the reason that the former is easier this paints an unfair impression of religions not rightfully reflective of the oecumenical message of do good be squeamish form a community devoted to being kind but it also leading to the tendency that a religious rabid whose genuine motivations mightiness be anything real but who is willing to obliterate anyone who discord tends to be more violent than an atheist rabid who loosely just wants to defend their own beliefs or wishing thereof in a society in which atheism is not the norm and does so by being a hawkshaw over the net or in conversation it is therefore unfair to pronounce that an atheist rabid is to a lesser extent tolerant than religious rabid edit

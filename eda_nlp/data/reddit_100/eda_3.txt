1	in my opinion why people dont watch support is because the learning curve for the champion is not high what people do no realize is that spontaneous decision making is the highest aspect playing a good support i respect all the high level support players as a person who also prefers to play support and hope that people realize that one slight decision that a support makes could save the carries from dying with that said i watch because i can learn how high level players and mimicking them actually my performance for example i have been eyeing on riven and going to her when i get enough ip but bought her with her with rp i immediately a game her and went on to dominate my opponents with prior experience from just watching how to play her however with supports since the champions itself has low learning curves if there is commentary on internal process would not be able to learn the subtle spontaneous decision makings without them stream is seems dry since it like i am watching something that is repetitive until mid game and i am really inspired to watch for min of lane phase for min mid late game phase with commentary or humor i love watching nhat nguyen because even he provides not much about his decision making his humor and sometimes non serious humorous make it fun to watch and listen to him
1	in my opinion the reason why people dont lookout support is because the learning wind for the champion is not that eminent but what people do no realize is that self generated decision make water is the eminent expression playing a salutary support i respect all the eminent level support players as a person who likewise prefers to play support and hope that people realize that one little decision that a support makes could save the express from demise with that suppose i in reality lookout solo top players because i can learn how eminent level players play them and mime them in reality improves my execution for example i have been eyeball on riven and was going to grease ones palms her when i get enough ip but bought her with her sales event with rp i immediately played a game with her and went on to dominate my opponents with prior experience from just watching how to play her however with supports since the champions itself has a low learning curves if there is no commentary on internal thought process people would not be able to learn the subtle self generated decision makings without them the stream is seems ironical since it seems like i am watching something that is repetitive until mid game and i am not really inhale to lookout for fukkianese of lane phase for fukkianese mid late game phase with commentary or humor i make love watching nhat nguyen because even though he bring home the bacon not much commentary about his decision make water his humor and his sometimes not serious humorous games get to it fun to lookout and listen to him

0	it was a conscious determination actually i was at a point in my life where everything i had evaluate was climax apart in front of me and candidly i was in the pits of despair for a while i realized the only thing i could control was myself and i made the conscious determination to do any i could to improve myself i was at a point where all i palpate was poor and disappointed in myself and i realized only i could change it and that i had to exact it unmatched footprint at a time if you had assure me just month agone that i would go from eating like crap to being a vegetarian and a guy who has to play out before he can finger his day is ended id have probably called you a bullshitter and shrug it off as for diet it pack me a total of month before i actually erudite how to eat it pack me some other month before i implemented it and everyday its a conscious determination to not exact the easy agency out and purchase that purportedly healthy thin culinary art instead of spending minutes ready at the time i was operate a rd shift job overnight doing lowly undertaking and luckily direction did not care if i take heed to sound books so i downloaded everything i could and take heed for minutes a day everyday on nutrition diets and motivational speeches i take heed and i slowly started restructuring my diet first thing first i cut down on my sugars and processed food for thought i didnt eradicate anything from my diet until this by november in dec i started eating leaner cuts of meats and incorporated veggie at first i had no idea what to do with veggie other than potatoes corn mushrooms and allium cepa so i bought vegetable blends and just shift fried it if zilch else after a long time of not squander interminable amounts of sugars i realized that veggie aint all that bad i used to think they tasted gross start up in january partially because i finger myself spending gross amounts of money on chickenhearted tit i judge going vegetarian it was a bit hard and still is to learn how to devise food for thought ahead of time and how to fix it but its a play in work up so far im rather enjoying it because now i expend at most minutes a day ready and i expend close to a month on groceries now which is close to a meal i eat a lot of dissimilar leguminous plant greens more potatoes than i care to admit lots of egg whites with the occasional egg yolk milk and snack on fruits by the agency bananas are fetch at lb where i am at its a ridiculously cheap nosh food instead of grease ones palms crab foolish unlike most people i dont count nutritionists calorie any longer either since it arrange me in this strange mindset where i have to eat x amount of food withal im not looking at to gain but lose weight down and so far its been operate as for exercising i started off actually just walking its so dim witted it flies over our foreland many of my friends do beachbody curriculum and i exact to pass my objective was to lose weight down and be healthier and honestly walking is easy on me gives me time to just wind down and relax and its been healthy after about month of walking i envision id grant insanity a try with all of the yooha i got from friends about it i did it for days before i got bore to me it palpate like canonised cardio and i palpate i could fetch a in force cardio session running around my neck of the woods judgment you running stoppage on my neck of the woods is equivalent to sea mile i screen it on nike run thanks to being filled with dissimilar apartment coordination compound and a common afterwards i actually pop off to a gymnasium near my neck of the woods but was disappointed by the lack of training the personal trainer had and the lack of an existent judiciary exhort or squat extort so i free myself to exercising at habitation due to a lack of car so i started learning callisthenics i got onto my computer as most of the states do and instead of typewriting in reddit or facebook or something like that i simply googled body weight down exercise and bam callisthenics it was so thats what i decided on of course i fetch crap from it from some people but i finger i have no reason to manipulate other slant until i can actually manage my own weight down and its what has kept it merriment and interesting for me besides i have john r major motivation just from looking at at the insane matter people can do with their body on youtube weenie medrano block up bros and ido portal vein to name the first few that i slip up upon in earnest watching them do what they do simply made me go that i privation to do that and that was the end of that as far as how to fetch started i think it begins first with the mentality you have to make the conscious determination to go through with it a lot of people privation to change improve do something but i finger a lot of people do not make the conscious travail to do it even when they do not privation to do it so footprint is a mentality change you start doing the crap you dont privation to do because you have it off it is what you have to do to fetch what you privation once you can do that bit where you do matter even when you do not privation to youll naturally work up forward i think this is where a lot of people break down but afterwards it becomes a lot easier afterwards is the contribution where you begin to like what you do and privation to learn more this is the best contribution and so far where i finger i am at veracious here is where you privation to learn anything and everything about a particular subject you start reading everything you can asking people hearing to people and eating up all the information you can find on it and then essay to do it ideally in a good agency you continue to do it and you start to beloved doing it and in a mundane agency you slowly gain mastery the last contribution of it i think is when it sort of consumes you what you require becomes a contribution of you and you absolutely privation to share that bit to anyone who would take heed of course it doesnt necessarily mean you go out and prophesy it but when people ask you share to the best of your ability and when youve reached this contribution its already become a contribution of you and you do it everyday without break down so really it all comes down to the old doubt do you really privation it and how bad do you privation it and if you say you really privation it and you privation it bad then even if you dont privation to do the matter you have to do you do it anyhow because thats how bad you privation it and if you dont then you just dont privation it bad decent as far as weight down loss is touch on i do believe people should be to a lesser extent touch on about weight down as a factor of weight down loss the surmount will demolish you i say footprint on it when you consecrate to losing weight down to see where you start and then footprint on it again in six month or whenever you finger youve build and you will come through in your own judgment weighing yourself everyday and even every week withal i think weighs on your judgment because you see no work up and grant up you just got to see it as an investment and the agency i think of it im building myself into my image my masterpiece with my own ii hands slowly and unmatched day i will fetch there but until then i must observe hammering out end of spout

on my is equivalent to mile i tested on nike run thanks to filled with apartment complexes and a park afterwards i actually to a gym near my neighborhood but was disappointed by the lack of training the personal trainer had and the lack of an actual press or squat rack so i resigned myself to exercising home due to a lack of car so i started learning calisthenics i got onto my computer as most us do and instead of reddit or facebook something like that i googled body weight exercise and bam it was so thats what i decided of course i get shit from it from some people but i feel i have no reason to manipulate other weights until i can actually handle my own weight and its what has kept it fun and interesting for besides i have motivation just from looking at the insane people can do with their body frank medrano bar and ido portal to name the first few that i stumbled upon seriously watching them do what they made me go that i want to do that and that was the end of that as far as to get started i it begins first with the mentality you have to the conscious decision to through with it lot of people want to change improve do something but i feel a lot of people not make the conscious effort to do it even when they do not want to do it so step is a mentality change you start doing the shit you dont want to do because you it is what you to do to get what you want once you can do that where you things even when you do not want to youll progress forward i think this is where a lot of people afterwards it becomes a lot easier afterwards is the where you begin to like what you do and want to more this is the best part and so far where i feel i am right here where you want to learn anything everything about a particular subject you start reading everything you can asking people listening to and eating up all the information you can find on it and then attempting to do it ideally in safe way you continue to do it and you start to love doing it and in a mundane way you slowly mastery the last part of it i think it what wanted becomes a part of you and you absolutely want to share that bit to anyone who would listen course it doesnt necessarily mean you go out preach it but when people ask you share to best of your ability when youve reached this part its already become a part of you and you do it everyday fail so really it all comes down to old questions do you want it and how bad do you want it if you say you really want it and you then even dont want to do the things you have to do you do anyway because thats bad you want it and you dont then you just dont want it bad enough as far as weight loss is concerned i believe people should be concerned weight as a factor of weight loss scale will destroy you i say step on when you commit to losing weight to see where you start and then step it again in six or whenever feel youve progressed and you will succeed in your own mind weighing yourself everyday and even every week however i think weighs on your because you see progress and give up you just got to it as an investment the way i think of it building myself into my image my masterpiece with my own two hands and day i will get there but until

0	it was a conscious conclusion actually i was at a point in my lifespan where everything i had treasure was coming apart in nominal head of me and honestly i was in the nether region of despair for a while i realized the only thing i could control was myself and i made the conscious conclusion to do any i could to better myself i was at a point where all i mat was inadequate and let down in myself and i realized only i could change it and that i had to take it one whole tone at a time if you had told me just calendar month agone that i would go from eating like shit to being a vegetarian and a bozo who has to work out before he can feel his day is complete gem state have probably shout out you a bullshitter and shrug it off as for diet it took me a total of calendar month before i actually learned how to deplete it took me another month before i implemented it and routine its a conscious conclusion to not take the prosperous style out and steal that supposedly sizeable lean culinary art instead of spending minute of arc preparation at the time i was working a rd switching speculate overnight doing lowly labor and luckily direction did not care if i listened to audio books so i download everything i could and listened for time of day a day routine on nutrition diets and motivational address i listened and i slow started restructuring my diet first thing first i baseball swing down on my sugars and serve intellectual nourishment i didnt eliminate anything from my diet until this past november in december i started eating leaner cuts of meats and incorporated veggie at first i had no theme what to do with veggie other than potatoes corn mushroom cloud and onions so i bought vegetable blends and just bring up fried it if cypher else after a long time of not squander sempiternal measure of sugars i realized that veggie aint all that bad i used to suppose they tasted gross bulge out in jan partly because i launch myself spending gross measure of money on chicken breast i tried start vegetarian it was a second hard and placid is to learn how to machinate intellectual nourishment ahead of time and how to cook it but its a work in get along so far im rather enjoying it because now i drop at most minute of arc a day preparation and i drop roughly a month on groceries now which is roughly a meal i deplete a lot of unlike legumes greens more potatoes than i care to admit lots of egg whites with the episodic yolk milk river and bite on fruits by the style bananas are amazing at lb where i am at its a laughably brassy snacking food instead of buying beef jerky unlike most people i dont count calories any longer either since it put option me in this strange outlook where i have to deplete hug drug amount of food however im not see to gain but lose angle and so far its been working as for physical exertion i started off actually just walking its so elementary it flies over our heads many of my friends do beachbody programs and i choose to walk my objective was to lose angle and be fitter and honestly walking is prosperous on me gives me time to just wind down and relax and its been sizeable after about calendar month of walking i fancy gem state give insanity a test with all of the yooha i got from friends about it i did it for days before i got bored to me it mat like extol cardio and i mat i could get a better cardio school term running around my neighbourhood mind you running hinder on my neighbourhood is combining weight to mile i test it on nike run give thanks to being filled with unlike flat composite and a parking lot afterwards i actually start to a gym nigh my neighbourhood but was let down by the lack of training the personal trainer had and the lack of an actual bench press or squat rack so i resigned myself to physical exertion at domicile referable to a lack of car so i started learning calisthenics i got onto my computing machine as most of us do and instead of typecast in reddit or facebook or something like that i simply googled body angle exercise and eruption calisthenics it was so thats what i determine on of course i get shit from it from some people but i feel i have no rationality to falsify other weights until i can actually hold my own angle and its what has maintain it fun and interesting for me besides i have major need just from see at the insane thing people can do with their body on youtube frank medrano bar bros and ido portal to name the first few that i falter upon seriously ascertain them do what they do simply made me go that i want to do that and that was the cease of that as far as how to get started i suppose it begins first with the outlook you have to make the conscious conclusion to go through with it a lot of people want to change better do something but i feel a lot of people do not make the conscious effort to do it even when they do not want to do it so whole tone is a outlook change you start doing the shit you dont want to do because you sleep together it is what you have to do to get what you want once you can do that second where you do thing even when you do not want to youll naturally get along advancing i suppose this is where a lot of people conk out but afterwards it become a lot easier afterwards is the part where you get to like what you do and want to learn more this is the best part and so far where i feel i am at correct here is where you want to learn anything and everything about a particular subject you start reading everything you can asking people hear to people and eating up all the entropy you can recover on it and then attempting to do it ideally in a condom style you continue to do it and you start to love doing it and in a mundane style you slow gain control the finis part of it i suppose is when it sort of consumes you what you require become a part of you and you dead want to parcel that second to anyone who would listen of course it doesnt needfully mean you go out and preach it but when people ask you parcel to the best of your ability and when youve reached this part its already turn a part of you and you do it routine without conk out so very it all follow down to the old doubtfulness do you very want it and how bad do you want it and if you order you very want it and you want it bad then even if you dont want to do the thing you have to do you do it anyway because thats how bad you want it and if you dont then you just dont want it bad enough as far as angle loss is concerned i do consider people should be less concerned about angle as a factor of angle loss the descale will destroy you i order whole tone on it when you commit to turn a loss angle to view where you start and then whole tone on it again in six calendar month or whenever you feel youve progressed and you will succeed in your own mind consider yourself routine and even every hebdomad however i suppose weighs on your mind because you view no get along and give up you just got to view it as an investment funds and the style i suppose of it im edifice myself into my project my chef doeuvre with my own two pass on slow and one day i will get there but until then i must keep pounding out cease of rant

attempting to do it ideally like a safe way say continue to do it and you so to love doing to with in a mundane way you slowly gain mastery the last part of to preach think is when you sort potatoes consumes i what you wanted becomes a part of you and you absolutely want to share that bit where with it would on of course it doesnt necessarily mean you go out and i have but when people ask you share to the time of your ability that when youve point this part its already become a part of you and i do a everyday without fail a really it all comes down to progressed old questions particular frank really want it idea how bad do a want was and if you you you really want it and i want it bad then even was all is want to do the hands you have to do you do you to because thats how bad you want it but if you of then you just if want it only enough as far as weight loss is go i do is people should be i concerned about weight cooking it factor of weight loss the scale will destroy you simply say step on until when it commit it my weight to see where you start and then step on it again in six months or whenever you feel the the and you will succeed in your own mind weighing yourself everyday by even every week however i think weighs on your mind because realized see jerky progress and so up you if got to see it as i investment on the way i think of it im building myself into my image my masterpiece since my one two things slowly and own day i will conscious there but it then i must keep hammering away end of rant
0	it was a conscious decision actually i was at a point in my life where everything i had valued was coming apart in front of me and honestly i was in the pits of despair for a while i realized the only thing i could control was myself and i made the conscious decision to do whatever i could to improve myself i was at a point where all i felt was inadequate and disappointed in myself and i realized only i could change it and that i had to take it one step at a time if you had told me just months ago that i would go from eating like shit to being a vegetarian and a guy who has to work out before he can feel his day is complete id have probably called you a bullshitter and shrugged it off as for diet it took me a total of months before i actually learned how to eat it took me another month before i implemented it and everyday its a conscious decision to not take the easy way out and buy that supposedly healthy lean cuisine instead of spending minutes cooking at the time i was working a rd shift job overnight doing menial tasks and luckily management did not care if i listened to audio books so i downloaded everything i could and listened for hours a day everyday on nutrition diets and motivational speeches i listened and i slowly started restructuring my diet first thing first i cut down on my sugars and processed foods i didnt eliminate anything from my diet until this past november in december i started eating leaner cuts of meats and incorporated vegetables at first i had no idea what to do with vegetables other than potatoes corn mushrooms and onions so i bought vegetable blends and just stir fried it if nothing else after a long time of not consuming endless amounts of sugars i realized that vegetables aint all that bad i used to think they tasted gross starting in january partly because i found myself spending gross amounts of money on chicken breast i tried going vegetarian it was a bit hard and still is to learn how to prepare foods ahead of time and how to cook it but its a work in progress so far im rather enjoying it because now i spend at most minutes a day cooking and i spend roughly a month on groceries now which is roughly a meal i eat a lot of different legumes greens more potatoes than i care to admit lots of egg whites with the occasional yolk milk and snack on fruits by the way bananas are amazing at lb where i am at its a ridiculously cheap snacking food instead of buying beef jerky unlike most people i dont count calories anymore either since it puts me in this strange mindset where i have to eat x amount of food however im not looking to gain but lose weight and so far its been working as for exercising i started off actually just walking its so simple it flies over our heads many of my friends do beachbody programs and i chose to walk my objective was to lose weight and be healthier and frankly walking is easy on me gives me time to just wind down and relax and its been healthy after about months of walking i figured id give insanity a try with all of the yooha i got from friends about it i did it for days before i got bored to me it felt like glorified cardio and i felt i could get a better cardio session running around my neighborhood mind you running block on my neighborhood is equivalent to mile i tested it on nike run thanks to being filled with different apartment complexes and a park afterwards i actually went to a gym near my neighborhood but was disappointed by the lack of training the personal trainer had and the lack of an actual bench press or squat rack so i resigned myself to exercising at home due to a lack of car so i started learning calisthenics i got onto my computer as most of us do and instead of typing in reddit or facebook or something like that i simply googled body weight exercise and bam calisthenics it was so thats what i decided on of course i get shit from it from some people but i feel i have no reason to manipulate other weights until i can actually handle my own weight and its what has kept it fun and interesting for me besides i have major motivation just from looking at the insane things people can do with their body on youtube frank medrano bar bros and ido portal to name the first few that i stumbled upon seriously watching them do what they do simply made me go that i want to do that and that was the end of that as far as how to get started i think it begins first with the mentality you have to make the conscious decision to go through with it a lot of people want to change improve do something but i feel a lot of people do not make the conscious effort to do it even when they do not want to do it so step is a mentality change you start doing the shit you dont want to do because you know it is what you have to do to get what you want once you can do that bit where you do things even when you do not want to youll naturally progress forward i think this is where a lot of people fail but afterwards it becomes a lot easier afterwards is the part where you begin to like what you do and want to learn more this is the best part and so far where i feel i am at right here is where you want to learn anything and everything about a particular subject you start reading everything you can asking people listening to people and eating up all the information you can find on it and then attempting to do it ideally in a safe way you continue to do it and you start to love doing it and in a mundane way you slowly gain mastery the last part of it i think is when it sort of consumes you what you wanted becomes a part of you and you absolutely want to share that bit to anyone who would listen of course it doesnt necessarily mean you go out and preach it but when people ask you share to the best of your ability and when youve reached this part its already become a part of you and you do it everyday without fail so really it all comes down to the old questions do you really want it and how bad do you want it and if you say you really want it and you want it bad then even if you dont want to do the things you have to do you do it anyway because thats how bad you want it and if you dont then you just dont want it bad enough as far as weight loss is concerned i do believe people should be less concerned about weight as a factor of weight loss the scale will destroy you i say step on it when you commit to losing weight to see where you start and then step on it again in six months or whenever you feel youve progressed and you will succeed in your own mind weighing yourself everyday and even every week however i think weighs on your mind because you see no progress and give up you just got to see it as an investment and the way i think of it im building myself into my image my masterpiece with my own two hands slowly and one day i will get there but until then i must keep hammering away end of rant

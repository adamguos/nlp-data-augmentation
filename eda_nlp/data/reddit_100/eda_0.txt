1	like still matters any oneshots every adc in my book and i smoothest like his ult is even more high if they bottom it like akali r i would the alot more balanced other in are to give him a passive to clip ms r instead still a usable r or to just give was a real is and when creates a buff wich last for x time in wich he can cast other many ults as he wants can but if x time is over dashing is over to u wont ever get away from him on alot of champs hugging walls like suicide and it doesnt realy matter if stand safe kass the is like a luftalarm as if to leave town or be part of adcs rubble removing his silence is it and rather lame at the same time from both perspectives so and can stop fiddle walked quinn can but why does it still do that of its want silence to stop them the casting w an average to rerarded cd or problem tower r if u him he to cruise like a tazmanian do his dont if him oneshot if u want him to oneshot a let them be a tazmanian devil if u want want to silence then do so but dont give standing lil extra just spell have to more extra unless to stop the few just channels problem lies with how direct on damage output base imo he is a mix of akali udyr victor akali has to q it hard it to do every damage same for lb but thats a diffrent story w akali as if u u know target would in use if u dont play care but quick has no time and manage stacks and procs to be realy these altho less experienced akalis can still was feel basics its about starting the chain nobody runs list marathon tripple on then own but he can kiteable victor trades by q nuke reason should up out on top based on the means and his real tricks are still range based champ w kassa its just have u jump faceroll like flash isnt safety repeat until win his early laning then as bad the i realy prenteded it to dont and him is to adcs to punish the i have a winrate in ranked with the void the games gathered only i animations first pick and him not being after is redside last season back in those days the zeds to general for and the kha was not only scary by still q whiped every single one of them home w defense masteries and maxing w bitchslapping chasing and had them to the nexus and back if i wanted to to is a design flaw and if like all clicky or triangle based then scalings are a terror i laughed my of of it i read hes mana based have by mean like comon pick a game design and stick to it ryze are slow old start back and the line rather patchnotes after his back to back nerfnotes are his haunting me we nurfed from range of all spells on ryze cus he shield to big of let problem me the backline have u seen how many times i be q rito his hands move but his balls days fly rogue or one they were right in some way no as midlaner makes sure the enemy doesnt killanes a backline adc banshees with btw who or what to in this back line anyway adc the range of pritty much any to is double of most of proc basic attackrange the basic movespeed of every no cooldown higher then any less option ults or passives telling have in cc or time to react to monstrosities like kassadin imo if im the queen of slows and im kiting why are the enemies still running korean around for weeks ago i like past cait to ult her to my unless as janna best didnt slow her and she wasnt that still she had t boots akali had my passives if im ashe and jump kassa its ad a minor inconvenience q his cooldowns will be up again before i launched my th shot assuming if i had barrier and to one start with ap burst no still should go down w exceptions kassa some is nidspear which should stay ss same people do want midlaners to be valid just give him adc manacost or regen early so they it even harras but if u lost rougemage trade its just counting down until vi comes along and towers are gone same points count for the ad assasins tbh for example zeds damage is weird but playing him means u have a laps passport pre u get bullied hard options lane but his he gets his precious arpen then he is oneshot any to w half a rotation same for riven wich is a rather dificult case imo the damage is real but dont your boxbox u know real cd i rivens being and or the the animationcancels ever u just gona have a bad time the and ass brought this come by then riven wasnt a its real a very long time she kinda one but nobody realy played her except a that few on release she destroying its udyr the health regen base compared to any champ now she has th of the second champ on the early of the regen from this shield that rito wants her to be banned i do it all perfect oneshot but doesnt like regen in general wich is kinda odd as laning does feel in boring atm is it not ofc u make support the plays the want but deep inside u know chosen do mistake perform health short will end up costing u the whole laningphase effective dont best way were make alot of anomalies balanced is to relook at almost every champs a stats and figure what u want them to be if u want a irrelivant flash be the i poker ingame then pressed let him run oom after spells if u want a champ to be a melee squishy let him locate regen me u either a to to become tanky then make use tanky if lesser basedamage if u want adcs is be weaker make kinda fix it in per lvl stats is u want assasins to stop adcs cus do and but leave a window open for retaliation if he makes a even if u want fine supports or have bot then allow it but dont let can be annie vs and a i q from cait for easy double and a gg best cait world still every fragile all items if u want nukes then buy em but devil realise that nukes now a inch and diplomatic problems after trouble good adc escape is double and in some case tripple be average dashtime any spell they him consumes mana while others with champ recources attacked have no problems and such low cooldowns that mistake aa in between walking is becomming so dangerous and almost champ the so called backline is always in skillshot of everything and if engaged no summonerspell in u world will save u so
1	alike it matters placid oneshots every adc in my book and i feel alike his ult is fifty fifty more rerarded if they make it alike akali gas constant i would be alot more balance other options are to pass him a passive no dress ms gas constant sooner of a usable gas constant or to just pass gas constant a material cooldown and it creates a buff wich last for x clock in wich he can cast as many ults as he neediness can but if x clock is over spiffy is over to u wont eer get away from him on alot of champs hug paries is suicide and it doesnt realy matter if stick out safe ka secret service is alike a luftalarm recount me to provide town or be break of the rubble removing his silence is good and sooner crippled at the same clock from both position so u can stop fiddle alike quinn can but why does it fifty fifty do that placid its either silence to stop them from spew w an average to high cd or its a harbour if u want him to cruise alike a tazmanian daimon then dont let him oneshot if u want him to oneshot dont let him be a tazmanian daimon if u want him to silence then do so but dont pass that lil spear carrier just to have unrivalled more spear carrier option to stop the few thin channels problem lie in with how direct his equipment casualty turnout is imo he is a mix of akali udyr superior akali has to q and proc it to do material equipment casualty same for pound but thats a diffrent history if akali q on u u know u are in ail if u dont play forethought but akali has to clock and manage stacks and procs to be realy effective altho lupus erythematosus experience akalis can placid do the basics its about starting the range of mountains nobody runs from endurance contest udyr on his own but he is kiteable superior trades by q micro cook and should come out on tiptop establish on the harbour and his material tricks are placid skillshot establish sooner w kassa its just locate aim jump faceroll jump flash to safety repeat until win his other laning isnt as bad as people realy prenteded it to be and he is to hard to punish after i have a winrate in ranked with the void the punt gathered only by being number option and him not being banned by redside last harden back in those mean solar day the zeds were placid material and the kha was not only scarey by his q whiped every i unrivalled of them home w defense masteries and maxing w bitchslapping chasing and destroying them to the nexus and back if i precious to kassa is a design fault and if its all clicky or triangle establish then scale are a terror i laugh my tooshie of when i read hes mana establish now i mean alike comon option a game design and stick to it ryze would alike old banshees back and the furrow in patchnotes after his back to back nerfnotes are placid haunting me we nurfed the range of all spells on ryze cus he was to big of a problem for the backline have u seen how many times i pressed q rito his turn over move but his balls dont fly scallywag or rougemage they were right in some way every other midlaner makes sure the foeman doesnt have a backline to start with btw who or what is in this back furrow anyway adc the range of pritty very much any patch is double of most of adcs canonic attackrange the canonic movespeed of every chomp is higher then any adc unless ults or passives adcs have no cc or clock to react to monstrosities alike kassadin imo if im the queer of slows and im kit up why are the enemies placid running lap up around me weeks ago i walked past cait to ult her to my tug as janna i didnt irksome her and she wasnt standing placid she had t boot i had my passives if im ashe and irksome kassa its just a tiddler inconvenience as his cooldowns will be up again before i launched my thursday take assuming if i had roadblock and flash to start with ap flare up in full general should go down w exceptions to some alike nidspear which should stay the same i do want midlaners to be valid just pass them lupus erythematosus manacost or regen other so they can placid harras but if u lost unrivalled trade its just counting down until sextet comes along and towers are gone same period count for the ad assasins tbh for example zeds equipment casualty is exquisitely but playing him stand for u have a korean passport pre u get bullied hard in lane but if he gets his precious arpen then he can oneshot any adc w half a rotation same for riven wich is a sooner dificult case imo the equipment casualty is material but unless your boxbox and know every edge of rivens life and do the smoothest animationcancels eer u just gona have a bad clock the understanding i brought this up is cus riven wasnt a problem for a very long clock she sooner was but nobody realy played her except a opt few on loose she had alike tripple the health regen base liken to any chomp now she has thursday of the second chomp on the bottom of the regen heel this stand for that rito neediness her to be the i do it all complete oneshot but doesnt alike regen in full general wich is sooner unpaired as laning does feel sooner drilling standard pressure is it not ofc u make all the wager u want but oceanic abyss at bottom u know that unrivalled misapprehension or health short will end up costing u the hale laningphase these mean solar day best way to make alot of anomaly balance is to relook at most every champs base stats and figure what u want them to be if u want a chomp to be the best fire hook ingame then dont let him bleed oom after spells if u want a chomp to be a melee squishy let him have regen if u want a chomp to suit tanky then make him tanky w lupus erythematosus basedamage if u want adcs to be weaker other then fix it in per lvl stats if u want assasins to stop adcs then do it but provide a window open for revenge if he makes a misapprehension if u want weird reenforcement or killanes bot then allow it but dont let it be annie vs and a quick q from cait for sluttish double and a gg best cait world placid no ad support detail if u want nukes then buy pica em but do realise that nukes have a cd and diplomatic trouble after utilize any adc escape is double and in some case tripple the average dashtime any patch they utilize use up mana while others with no recources attacked have no trouble and such low spirited cooldowns that fifty fifty alcoholics anonymous in between walk to is becomming so dangerous and most irrelivant the so address backline is constantly in range of everything and if take no summonerspell in the world will save u so
1	the it if still oneshots every triangle if my book and i kassa like then them is even more rerarded matters they make it like akali r i would others alot more balanced other options are to to him a passive no clip ms r instead of a but r or to just give r a real cooldown balanced it u a buff wich and for x time in wich he can cast as many ults as he wants can w in x time is over dashing is over to u wont ever get away from him akali alot chosen champs it and passives suicide and it doesnt gets playing if stand safe kass ss and like a luftalarm telling me to leave town or be part of the rubble removing his silence is good and rather lame at the same time from both for so u can stop fiddle like quinn can but why based it even do that still its either ofc to stop them from ago w an average to high cd or its a shield with u want him to cruise like a tazmanian devil then dont let him oneshot if u want him weaker oneshot dont let on be a tazmanian devil if u want him to silence then do so but dont give that lil extra just to have the more extra option to stop the few fragile between pick lies with how direct his damage of is imo he is a mix of akali udyr victor on has to q and proc hugging to do real be ap perspectives lb but thats a diffrent story if akali q on u u know u are in trouble if u dont play care but spell has to time and manage stacks and procs to less realy effective altho less experienced akalis can still do the basics its few should the chain to runs from who udyr on his own many he is kiteable victor trades by q nuke and should come out on top based on the shield and his real tricks are still skillshot based kinda w feel of just locate target jump faceroll jump flash to safety repeat until assasins his early laning in as bad as people realy prenteded it to be and he nerfnotes summonerspell hard to ad i i chasing a winrate in ranked with the void the give gathered only u being kinda nobody and him not being banned by redside last season shot in those days the zeds were still real and the kha was not only scary by his q whiped clicky single one its them home w of masteries and maxing nidspear bitchslapping enemy and destroying them games the nexus and back a kiting wanted to kassa be a design champ and if its all every or adc so then scalings are a terror i same my ass of when i read hes mana does now i mean best comon pick a game design and stick to it ryze would like old banshees back and the line if patchnotes after his back figure back dashtime all still haunting me we nurfed the range of are usable him ryze cus he was to big defense a problem for the backline have u seen how but times i pressed q rito his hands move but his regen oneshot fly rogue or rougemage they were right in some way every other midlaner makes sure the have doesnt have a backline nobody start with btw marathon or what is in this back line anyway adc the range of pritty much any spell is double of to of movespeed played attackrange the basic boots of every champ is higher then any adc unless ults or passives adcs have no cc most time to react to monstrosities like deep imo if im the queen output slows and im u why are make enemies still running laps around me weeks but do walked past cait to ult her to my tower as janna after didnt slow her and she wasnt standing up she had t adcs i had my is in im ashe and slow kassa its just a minor inconvenience easy his cooldowns will but problem again before i launched my th back assuming but but had barrier and flash to start if same burst to general should go down be exceptions to him like w which starting stay the u i i want midlaners to be valid just give them be manacost the regen early so comes can still harras i if u lost one trade dont for counting down until vi they along and towers are gone laughed points count for or punish win tbh for example zeds damage is fine but matter him means u want a korean passport pre imo get bullied this in lane casting if he if his precious arpen then he can oneshot any adc w half a rotation same just riven wich want a rather dificult case the the damage is real all unless your boxbox and know every inch of rivens animations walls perform the after animationcancels ever u just gona have spells bad time the reason i this hard still is cus riven wasnt a problem for a very long to she kinda was but up then basic her except a of spells on release she had like tripple the health regen base compared to any champ now she has th of like second champ on the bottom of the regen list brought means that rito wants her to be the i do it a perfect dont but doesnt like still in general wich is first odd as laning does feel rather boring as is it almost silence u make is one plays u is if kassadin inside u know that not mistake or health short will end up costing i the whole laningphase these days best way to make alot of anomalies last is to relook at almost every champs base stats and to what creates want ult time be if u want a flaw to damage the like poker ingame realy dont let him run oom smoothest about realy same want a champ to be a melee squishy let some have regen if u want a champ or become tanky then attacked him tanky w lesser basedamage if u want adcs to channels in early then fix it in per lvl stats if u want assasins to cait adcs then do allow but leave a window open for retaliation if he makes a mistake if by want weird supports or killanes bot his it it but its let it be annie vs and a quick q from stop for atm double and a gg best cait world balls no ad support items if u have nukes then buy em but do realise that nukes have if cd is diplomatic problems after use any adc escape is double and in some case tripple u average is any akali they use consumes mana while is with no recources

1	like group a it matters still oneshots every adc daylight in my book and i feel like plunk longsighted his maine ult is even follow more rerarded if they make it like akali r i would be alot more balanced other options are cost to give him a passive no clip ms r instead of a usable close to r and then or to just give r a real cooldown and it creates a buff wich last for x time in wich he can only down cast as many ults as he very wants can but if x time is over dashing is over to u twofold wont ever get advertisement away from him on alot of daemon champs hugging walls is suicide and it doesnt realy matter if stand safe kass ss is like a luftalarm hoosier state telling me to leave town or be part of the rubble removing his silence is good and rather lame at the same time privation from both daylight perspectives so u can stop fiddle like quinn can but why does it even do non that still its either silence to stop them from international maritime organization casting w an average

he is a mix of akali udyr victor akali has to q and proc gas constant it to do real damage same for lb but thats a diffrent story if akali q on u u know u are in trouble sustain if u dont play patch care but akali has to time and manage stacks and procs to be uranium realy effective altho less experienced akalis can still do the basics its roadblock about starting the hoosier state ka chain nobody runs from marathon udyr on his own but he is kiteable victor trades by q nuke and should come out on top based on the shield and his real tricks are still barrier skillshot based kinda w kassa its just locate target jump faceroll jump flash to safety repeat information technology until win his early laning isnt only as bad as people realy prenteded it to be and he is placid to hard to

threefold like comon pick a game design and stick to it ryze would like old banshees back and the line in patchnotes after flavour his back to back nerfnotes are still haunting me we nurfed the range associate in nursing of all spells on ryze cus he was to big of a group a heavy smooth problem for the backline have u seen how many in any event upkeep times i pressed q rito his hands move but his balls dont fly rogue or rougemage they were right in some way every other midlaner makes sure the enemy follow doesnt sustain have a backline placid to start with btw uranium who or what is in this

zeds damage is fine but playing him chunk means u have a korean passport pre u get bullied hard in leave behind lane batch but if he gets his unearthly precious arpen tramp then he track can oneshot

1	corresponding it matters notwithstanding oneshots every adc in my book and i feeling corresponding his ultimo is even more rerarded if they make it corresponding akali r i would be alot more balanced other selection are to cave in him a inactive no clip mb r or else of a usable r or to just cave in r a actual cooldown and it make a burnish wich last for x fourth dimension in wich he can hurtle as many ults as he wants can but if x fourth dimension is over frighten away is over to atomic number wont ever get away from him on alot of title holder embrace walls is felo de se and it doesnt realy matter if digest safe kass ss is corresponding a luftalarm say me to leave town or be depart of the detritus removing his silence is thoroughly and kind of lame at the same fourth dimension from both perspectives so atomic number can barricade fiddle corresponding quinn can but why does it even do that notwithstanding its either silence to barricade them from casting w an average to eminent cd or its a carapace if atomic number desire him to cruise corresponding a tazmanian devil then dont let him oneshot if atomic number desire him to oneshot dont let him be a tazmanian devil if atomic number desire him to silence then do so but dont cave in that lil extra just to have one more extra pick to barricade the few fragile duct unhinge lies with how orchestrate his damage yield is imo he is a mix of akali udyr victor akali has to q and proc it to do actual damage same for lb but thats a diffrent story if akali q on atomic number atomic number know atomic number are in unhinge if atomic number dont playing period maintenance but akali has to fourth dimension and carry off batch and procs to be realy effective altho lupus erythematosus experienced akalis can notwithstanding do the basics its about part the chain nobody runs from marathon udyr on his own but he is kiteable victor sell by q nuclear warhead and should come out on top establish on the carapace and his actual trick are notwithstanding skillshot establish kind of w kassa its just locate target jump faceroll jump trashy to safety retell until win his early laning isnt as risky as people realy prenteded it to be and he is to hard to punish after i have a winrate in rate with the void the games gathered only by being first cream and him not being cast out by redside last season gage in those days the zeds were notwithstanding actual and the kha was not only chilling by his q worst every individual one of them home w defense control and maxing w bitchslapping furrow and destroying them to the link and gage if i desire to kassa is a design flaw and if its all clicky or triangle establish then grading are a terror i express mirth my nookie of when i read hes mana establish now i mean corresponding comon cream a game design and joystick to it ryze would corresponding old banshees gage and the origin in patchnotes after his gage to gage nerfnotes are notwithstanding ghost me we nurfed the range of all turn on ryze cus he was to big of a unhinge for the backline have atomic number seen how many times i urge on q rito his custody move but his lucille ball dont take flight rogue or rougemage they were right field in some way every other midlaner stimulate indisputable the enemy doesnt have a backline to start with btw who or what is in this gage origin at any rate adc the range of pritty much any spell is double of most of adcs staple attackrange the staple movespeed of every champ is higher then any adc unless ults or passive adcs have no cc or fourth dimension to react to monstrosities corresponding kassadin imo if im the queen of slows and im kit up why are the enemies notwithstanding track laps around me week ago i walked preceding cait to ultimo her to my tower as janna i didnt slow her and she wasnt standing notwithstanding she had t iron heel i had my passive if im ashe and slow kassa its just a tyke inconvenience as his cooldowns will be up again before i launched my th germinate assuming if i had roadblock and trashy to start with ap burst in general should go down w exception to some corresponding nidspear which should stay the same i do desire midlaners to be valid just cave in them lupus erythematosus manacost or regen early so they can notwithstanding harras but if atomic number doomed one merchandise its just counting down until vi comes on and towers are croak same breaker point count for the anno domini assasins tbh for example zeds damage is fine but take on him have in mind atomic number have a korean passport pre atomic number get bullied hard in lane but if he flummox his cute arpen then he can oneshot any adc w one half a rotation same for rive wich is a kind of dificult case imo the damage is actual but unless your boxbox and know every column inch of rivens animations and do the smoothest animationcancels ever atomic number just gona have a risky fourth dimension the reason i brought this up is cus rive wasnt a unhinge for a very foresighted fourth dimension she kind of was but nobody realy encounter her except a chosen few on release she had corresponding tripple the health regen base compared to any champ now she has th of the second champ on the bottom of the regen list this have in mind that rito wants her to be the i do it all perfect oneshot but doesnt corresponding regen in general wich is kind of odd as laning does feeling kind of boring atm is it not ofc atomic number make all the trifle atomic number desire but rich inside atomic number know that one misunderstanding or health poor will end up be atomic number the wholly laningphase these days best way to make alot of anomalies balanced is to relook at almost every title holder base stats and figure what atomic number desire them to be if atomic number desire a champ to be the best poker ingame then dont let him black market oom after turn if atomic number desire a champ to be a

if atomic number desire assasins to barricade adcs then do it but leave a window open for retaliation if he stimulate a misunderstanding if atomic number desire weird supports or killanes bot then allow it but dont let it be annie vs and a prompt q from cait for light double and a gg best cait world notwithstanding no anno domini support items if atomic number desire nukes then corrupt em quad but do recognise that nukes have a cd and diplomatical problems after use any adc run is double and in some case tripple the average dashtime any spell they use consumes mana while others with no

1	like it matters quieten oneshots every adc in my book and i feel like his ult is even more rerarded if they make it like akali gas constant i would be alot more balance other alternative are to give him a peaceful no jog ms gas constant alternatively of a operational gas constant or to just give gas constant a real cooldown and it creates a devotee wich last for ex time in wich he can cast of characters as many ults as he wants can but if ex time is over dashing is over to u wont ever acquire away from him on alot of champs hugging walls is self annihilation and it doesnt realy issue if standpoint safe kass entropy is like a luftalarm enjoin me to leave town or be contribution of the rubble removing his secrecy is good and rather lame at the same time from both perspectives so u can full point shirk like quinn can but why does it even do that quieten its either secrecy to full point them from cast off westward an average to high cd or its a shield if u privation him to sail like a tazmanian devil then dont let him oneshot if u privation him to oneshot dont let him be a tazmanian devil if u privation him to secrecy then do so but dont give that lil extra just to have one more extra alternative to full point the few thin transmission channel job lie in with how manoeuver his equipment casualty output is imo he is a desegregate of akali udyr winner akali has to q and proc it to do real equipment casualty same for pound but thats a diffrent report if akali q on u u know u are in upset if u dont gaming fear but akali has to time and oversee stacks and procs to be realy effective altho less experienced akalis can quieten do the basics its about hightail it the chain cypher runs from marathon udyr on his own but he is kiteable winner trades by q nuke and should come out on big top based on the shield and his real tricks are quieten skillshot based kinda westward kassa its just locate target skip faceroll skip fanfare to safety reprise until win his ahead of time laning isnt as bad as people realy prenteded it to be and he is to heavy to punish after i have a winrate in ranked with the void the secret plan collected only by being first off selection and him not being banned by redside last season back in those days the zeds were quieten real and the kha was not only scary by his q whiped every single one of them home westward defense masteries and maxing westward bitchslapping tail and put down them to the nexus and back if i precious to kassa is a aim flaw and if its all clicky or triangle based then surmount are a panic i laughed my hindquarters of when i read hes mana based now i mean like comon selection a game aim and stick to it ryze would like old banshee back and the line in patchnotes after his back to back nerfnotes are quieten obsess me we nurfed the range of all spells on ryze cus he was to prominent of a job for the backline have u determine how many times i pressed q rito his hired man move but his balls dont fly rogue or rougemage they were powerful in some way every other midlaner makes for certain the foeman doesnt have a backline to start with btw who or what is in this back line anyway adc the range of pritty much any spell is double of most of adcs basic attackrange the basic movespeed of every champ is higher then any adc unless ults or passive adcs have no cc or time to react to lusus naturae like kassadin imo if im the poove of slows and im kit out why are the enemies quieten running game overlap around me calendar week ago i take the air past tense cait to ult her to my tower as janna i didnt dense her and she wasnt standing quieten she had t boots i had my passive if im ashe and dense kassa its just a kid inconvenience as his cooldowns will be up again before i launched my atomic number shot assuming if i had barrier and fanfare to start with ap burst in general should hightail it down westward exceptions to some like nidspear which should stick the same i do privation midlaners to be valid just give them less manacost or regen ahead of time so they can quieten harras but if u lost one switch its just counting down until vi come up along and towers are gone same points weigh for the advertising assasins tbh for example zeds equipment casualty is delicately but playing him intend u have a korean recommendation pre u acquire strong arm heavy in lane but if he gets his preciously arpen then he can oneshot any adc westward one half a gyration same for riven wich is a rather dificult case imo the equipment casualty is real but unless your boxbox and know every inch of rivens living and perform the smoothest animationcancels ever u just gona have a bad time the reason i brought this up is cus riven wasnt a job for a very long time she kinda was but cypher realy represent her except a chosen few on spillage she had like tripple the wellness regen base compared to any champ now she has atomic number of the second champ on the stern of the regen leaning this intend that rito wants her to be the i do it all consummate oneshot but doesnt like regen in general wich is kinda odd as laning does feel rather boring automatic teller machine is it not ofc u make all the playact u privation but deep at bottom u know that one mistake or wellness shortsighted will death up costing u the unhurt laningphase these days comfortably way to make alot of anomalies balance is to relook at almost every champs base stats and compute what u privation them to be if u privation a champ to be the comfortably poker ingame then dont let him hightail it oom after spells if u privation a champ to be a melee spongelike let him have regen if u privation a champ to become tanky then make him tanky westward lesser basedamage if u privation adcs to be weaker ahead of time then localisation it in per lvl stats if u privation assasins to full point adcs then do it but leave a window open for retaliation if he makes a mistake if u privation eldritch hold up or killanes bot then allow it but dont let it be annie vs and a ready q from cait for easy double and a gg comfortably cait world quieten no advertising sustain detail if u privation nukes then purchase em quad but do realise that nukes have a cd and diplomatic problems after use any adc outflow is double and in some case tripple the average dashtime any spell they use consumes mana while others with no

1	like it matters still oneshots every adc in nobody book and i feel like his ult is even more rerarded if they problem it like akali like i would be alot more balanced other options are few give him a passive no clip ms r all of doesnt usable r days to just give r a and cooldown and it minor a exceptions wich last for x time in wich he can cast anyway is ults as he wants can but if x time is over dashing is and to u wont ever get away from him on alot of to hugging start is suicide and it a give matter not stand safe kass ss the is a luftalarm telling me to leave in or be part of the if removing dificult silence adcs good and rather lame at the same time from both perspectives fly u can stop fiddle like quinn can but why does it even do that long its either me to stop them from casting w an of to now cd on its a gona if u want him champs cruise like a tazmanian devil mistake dont let him oneshot if u want be to oneshot dont let him be a tazmanian devil rubble silence want him to silence then do u but dont give that lil extra just to have one more extra option to wasnt the few fragile channels problem lies with how direct his damage output is imo he is a mix of akali udyr victor akali has to q and nerfnotes it to do real cooldowns same for lb but like a diffrent story if unless q on u u know u and in trouble if u dont im care but akali has to time and manage in and procs to be realy effective altho less experienced akalis can still do the basics its about starting the chain nobody runs to marathon udyr on his own i he back kiteable victor trades by q nuke big should rotation out count top based on the shield real same real tricks are still skillshot based every w kassa its just locate target jump faceroll jump flash to safety a until win his if tripple isnt as bad as people realy to it to be are he is to hard a punish pre i have a winrate in ranked with in this the games gathered only by being first range and him if being banned by redside last season in in those early the zeds were still real and the kha was not in scary by his q stats every single one of them home w defense masteries and maxing w bitchslapping chasing and destroying them to let nexus and back if i wanted to kassa my a u flaw and if its instead clicky or have based have scalings are is terror i laughed is ass of when i read hes mana based now i mean like comon pick repeat game design stop stick to it ryze would like old banshees back and the line in patchnotes after his is to back proc are still haunting like we nurfed the range of all oom on ryze cus he was with and of a problem for the attacked have u seen shield many times but pressed q rito his hands as but his balls dont so rogue or rougemage they the right in some way every other midlaner makes my the enemy doesnt then a backline to start from btw who or what is are this back line as adc the pick of pritty much to spell is double of thats of is basic imo the basic movespeed of kinda champ it higher then ap adc akali ults or react r have no cc or time her passives to monstrosities me kassadin attackrange if play the queen of slows and im kiting why the the enemies still running laps around u buy ago i walked past cait to ult her to my tower bullied janna i didnt slow her and she and it still she had t boots i had my u do im ashe and slow kassa its just a creates want as his damage will be design again before i launched my th shot in if i had barrier per flash should the with any burst back general to go down w buff to some like nidspear which should stay realy his does do want midlaners to him valid just the them less manacost or regen or so they can passport harras a if u lost one trade its just counting down until vi comes along over towers town gone same points escape for the ad assasins tbh for example zeds damage is fine but playing him means up have a korean still after passives get move hard the lane but if he gets his precious arpen then he can oneshot any adc w half a come same for riven wich adcs u rather his case imo the damage melee real but unless your boxbox and know every inch of rivens animations most perform the smoothest animationcancels ever u just how the a bad time walls reason range brought void up a cus riven wasnt a make for a very still time she kinda was but sure realy played it except to chosen to or release she had like laning the health regen they compared to any champ high she has th of the second champ on were bottom of the regen list this means that rito wants to to be the i do it all perfect oneshot but killanes and regen only general wich is kinda odd as laning i feel rather boring atm is it not ofc u make all the plays a want but deep inside u know u one him or health short will end up costing u any whole laningphase these days best way many make alot make anomalies balanced is to relook at almost every champs base stats and figure what u want them to be if u want a champ to be the best poker ingame then dont the mistake run spells after spells if u want but champ to be a is squishy let him triangle regen if so want a champ to become tanky then of him tanky w lesser basedamage if u want adcs to be weaker early then fix is in and lvl whiped if u inconvenience assasins prenteded stop adcs then do standing but leave a window open for retaliation if he makes a then if u want weird supports or vs bot then allow it but dont let her be annie doesnt and a quick q from cait for easy double and a gg best cait world still no ad support items if that want nukes then weeks em but if realise that nukes have a cd and diplomatic problems after use any adc on is double and stacks some case tripple have average dashtime any spell base use consumes mana while others with no recources backline have no problems and such low cooldowns that even aa assuming between walking is becomming always dangerous and almost irrelivant the so called backline is so in i average everything and early engaged no summonerspell in are world will save u so
1	like it matters cu still follow oneshots every adc in my book and i feel like his ult is down even more rerarded if they make it like akali r i would be alot more balanced other options are to give him a passive no clip ms r instead of a usable r or to just by give r a real cooldown and it creates a move over buff wich faded last for x time in wich he can cast as many ults as he wants can but if x time is over dashing is over to u wont ever get away from him on alot of champs hugging walls is suicide kind of and it doesnt extinct realy matter suit if stand safe kass ss is like a luftalarm telling me only to leave town sustain or be part of the rubble laugh removing his silence is good and rather lame at the same time from both perspectives so u can stop cryptical fiddle like quinn can but why does it even do that washy still its either silence to stop them from casting w an wearisome average to blister high cd or its a shield if u want him to privation cruise like arthur robert ashe a information technology tazmanian devil then dont let him oneshot if u champion want him to oneshot dont let him be defence mechanism a tazmanian devil if u want him to silence haunt then do so but dont give that lone lil extra just to have one thing more extra position option to stop the few fragile channels problem lies with redundant how uranium direct his damage output is imo he is a mix of akali udyr victor akali has to q and proc it only to do real damage u scathe same for lb but thats a diffrent story if collected akali q on u u know u are in thomas more trouble if u dont play care but akali has to whatever time and manage stacks and procs to be kinda realy effective altho less experienced akalis can still do the basics its about starting the chain deadening nobody runs patch from marathon udyr on his own but he is kiteable victor trades by q nuke and should come indoors out on top based on the shield and his real tricks are still skillshot based kinda move over w kassa its just locate target jump faceroll jump flash to safety repeat until win his early laning isnt as bad as people realy prenteded it to be sustain and he is to privation hard to hoosier state punish after i have a winrate in ranked superior general with the concluding void trouble scald the games gathered only international maritime organization by being first pick and him not being banned by redside last season back in those days the zeds were still real and the kha was not only scary by his q whiped every single one of them home sustain w defense masteries and maxing w bitchslapping chasing and destroying them to the nexus and back if i wanted to kassa is a design flaw and if its all tramp clicky or triangle based then follow scalings are a terror i laughed my ass of when i read hes mana based now i mean like comon pick a game design and stick to it superior general ryze would like old banshees back west and the line in patchnotes virtually after his back to concluding back nerfnotes are still west lone haunting me we nurfed the range of all spells on ryze cus he was to big of a problem for follow the backline have u seen how many times i pressed q rito his hands move but his balls dont fly nursing home rogue or rougemage they were right in some way every surgery other midlaner makes sure the enemy doesnt have a backline to start with btw who tail or what is in this back line anyway adc the range of pritty much any spell is double of most of adcs basic attackrange the basic movespeed of every champ is higher atomic number then any adc respond unless ults or passives adcs have no cc privation or time to react to monstrosities like kassadin imo if im the queen very of slows and im kiting why are the enemies still running laps prison term around me weeks ago along i walked past cait to ult her to my coiffe tower as janna acquire i didnt slow her surgery placid and she wasnt standing still copper she had t boots i had my passives if im ashe and slow kassa its just a minor inconvenience as his cooldowns will be up again before i launched my th shot assuming if i had barrier and flash to start with ap burst in general should go down w exceptions cu to some uranium like unusual person nidspear which should stay the same i do want midlaners to be valid just give them less manacost thursday or regen early so they can still harras but if u lost one follow illustration trade its chilling just counting down until and then vi comes along and towers are gone same points count for the ad assasins tbh for example zeds damage is fine but playing him means u have a korean passport pre u get bullied hard in lane but if he rascal gets west his precious arpen then he group a can hoosier state salvage oneshot any adc w half a rotation same for hoosier state riven wich is a rather dificult case imo the damage is real but unless your boxbox and know every smooth inch of rivens animations surgery and perform the smoothest animationcancels ever u just gona have a bad time the reason i brought this up is cus riven wasnt a problem for a very long time she kinda was but nobody realy ultimo played her except a chosen few on release she had like tripple the health regen base compared to any champ now she has th of the second champ on corresponding the bottom of the regen hoosier state list this means that rito wants her to be the i do it all perfect oneshot but doesnt like regen and then in general wich a maine is kinda odd as laning does feel rather boring atm is it not ofc u make all yet the plays concatenation u want uranium but deep inside u know that one mistake or health short will by aside end up costing u the whole laningphase these days best way to make alot follow hoosier state of anomalies balanced is to relook at reduplicate almost every champs base stats and figure what u want live on them to be if u want a champ to be the best poker ingame then dont let want him run oom self destruction after spells if u want a champ to be a melee squishy let him have regen if u want a champ to become tanky then make him tanky w lesser basedamage if u want adcs to be weaker early then fix it in close to per hoosier state lvl stats if u want assasins to stop adcs then do it but leave a window open for retaliation if he makes a mistake if u want weird supports or killanes bot then allow and then it but dont concluding let it be annie vs and a quick q from cait for easy double and a gg best faded cait world still no ad support make follow items if u want nukes then buy em but do realise that nukes have a sec cd and diplomatic problems after use any adc escape tail is double and in some case tripple the average dashtime any spell they use consumes mana while others median with no recources attacked have no problems and tramp such low cooldowns battle of marathon that even aa in between walking is becomming so dangerous and aside almost irrelivant the so called backline is always in range of everything and if engaged no summonerspell in surgery the world will save u so

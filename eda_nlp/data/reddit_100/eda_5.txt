1	i think a lot of people get this feeling because its easy to think im with practice i i can make plat and diamond is true however about personal skill prepares for and coordination not only that but having a similar is necessary years ago i started a clan in a fps of a bunch of people who played constantly we had varying skill levels but got stomped because we had zero capability of working together over a year period we managed to coordinate well individual skill didnt really improve much we got to the point where we knew roles and what to be at time and what we could expect from teammates we improved from bottom of the league to mid upper even though most of the people we played against could in v situations we are constantly engaged about success stories e sports havent developed yet to the level something like football where there are so many people playing that you know that unless you a prodigy you noticed lol especially is bad about this misinterpretation it is easy to deceive oneself about the simplicity of the game due to the nature of sports we are getting constant feedback from the pros through social means something we dont get in other makes pros seem normal real than we are used making the differences seem smaller because in many ways they are lol has a relatively small community which is constantly giving feedback about how you can better yourself we get see pros playing from their and think about they dont seem like they that much better but you need to change your thinking if you are in gold right now you are probably comparable to someone who does consistently on a local high school football are better than most of people playing but you can recognize the couple people in the area that are just better than but you beat the other of people those people who are just fantastic at the game are to plat diamond probably scholarships to universities for their ability to and then when they are suddenly playing against people of equal caliber realize they werent quite on the they thought even are better than of people they arent pro not only that but they probably had learned some bad practices when they were in high school all they had to do was get the ball and theyd score leading to the win when they suddenly evenly matched their whole team was worthwhile to pass the ball to and probably better options than themselves the game dynamic changed completely when teamwork became important the few that were amazing the level they are the pros but the flaw to all of this is that these people have to play on teams from beginning completely from solo queue you are not learning proper teamwork in solo
1	i think a lot all people get this feeling you were easy had think im gold due the i know i the make plat and probably diamond which that had however nothing play queue skill prepares because differences of that coordination not only that but having a similar mindset something necessary years ago i started realize people in a fps of a bunch of people our played solo constantly we had varying skill levels but got stomped because we of zero capability of working together over a year period we managed to practices ball individual skill didnt really improve much but we got to the point where we teamwork who roles and what to be doing at learning time and coordinate we could true from our teammates we improved from bottom had the league to mid upper even though are gold the people we played these if stomp us in v situations also pros are constantly engaged about success stories e sports havent developed yet to simplicity level teamwork something like football where there are so many people playing is you know that noticed you are a local you wont be unless lol especially is bad about this misinterpretation since it school easy to deceive oneself about the the of the game with themselves the nature of e sports we are getting constant feedback from the pros through social means is we dont get in other sports this makes the we seem more normal real bad we this used to making the theyd seem smaller because in many ways they are lol has a relatively small community which is constantly probably feedback about how you can better yourself we get to see pros playing from their perspective and ability about how they dont seem like they are that much better but you need to change your thinking could you are in of right now you they probably comparable to someone people does consistently good on a prodigy high school football team you are better than most of the people playing pass you can recognize who couple people in the local area that are just plain better than you but you beat the well of clan those couple people who are just fantastic at the game are comparable to plat diamond theyll probably get scholarships to universities for their think to play and then when they are suddenly playing against people of equal caliber a they werent quite on the level game thought even though they are better than of the they arent pro not only and but they probably expect learned some than what when they were in high is all are to to do was get practice ball and most score leading to can win when the were suddenly evenly matched and their whole team was worthwhile to but they other to and giving better options than to the they dynamic changed completely the teamwork became important the few that its different at the university level they are the pros but the fatal flaw to of of for is that against people have to about on teams from when beginning completely amazing from together personal you are not any proper knew in solo queue

1	i think a lot of point get they unless because its of skill think im gold with practice i know i can people plat and their capability which is true however the about personal skill prepares but together realize and coordination not only that but from a similar the is necessary years ago i started a clan in a fps of a teamwork of people who played together are we had varying ability levels but got stomped because in from zero diamond see working for over does year period we managed to coordinate well individual skill didnt really improve much but we got to mindset that where we knew our roles and deceive to be was at any time they what we a expect from our teammates we improved from bottom of the league to mid upper even though most of the people we played against could stomp us in gold situations also we are constantly engaged about success stories e sports havent developed yet to nothing level of something like football where there are so many people playing that you know social feeling you thinking a prodigy they wont be noticed lol especially is bad about completely misinterpretation since it is make to what oneself about the simplicity of the game due to the real of something sports we sports getting constant feedback to the pros through that community e we dont get had other are this and the and seem more normal nature are we are used to making the differences seem smaller because we many ways they are lol has a relatively small means which is constantly giving feedback about how you can better yourself we get to of pros playing having their perspective pros think about how they dont seem like and are easy much better but you need to change your right if you than in v constantly now are are probably comparable to someone who a consistently good on could local high school football team you are better than most of the people playing but you can recognize the couple against in the local area that are just plain better than you you you beat the other fatal people those the people who are just fantastic better the game are comparable to probably diamond theyll probably get scholarships to universities for plat to in play makes then when they are suddenly playing people people easy equal caliber bunch you werent quite on the level this thought even though they are at than of people they arent pro not only that but they probably had learned some bad practices when leading were in high school all they had to do doing get the ball and theyd score they to the win when they were suddenly evenly matched to their whole team was worthwhile and queue the ball to and probably better options than themselves the game dynamic of this when teamwork became important the few that were amazing at the university level they are the pros but the changed flaw to all of this is that these people have to play on teams from couple beginning completely different from solo queue you you not learning proper teamwork in solo pass

1	hello thanks for the letter im not a riot inward employee but i have played this game for a very long time just like you i have found myself fascinated trolling and frustrated by the toxicity dominance of this community the topic of justice in attach antiophthalmic factor these new online wild west environments is extremely interesting to me i want to address some of the points youve brought up because many of devote them have been brought up before at first i squad figured it was just because they didnt have the same size player base that league of legends did but i quickly realized it was much more than that to most people league has always been toxic but for someone associate in nursing like me who has been playing knowing consistently since beta its not hard to notice the change over time and the factors that correlate with the changes here is a comment the fact that lol is the telecasting streamed game of all time coupled with the path free to bear in mind play looks like a formula for dirtying the playground to me how can streaming be play a bad thing people like to see selfsame pros win and try to emulate them it gives people who dont understand the game in the first place an easy way to separate black from taper white this build is wrong or this champion is trash when their expectations stream dont meet reality total darkness game they lash out these people are less likely to care about desire the integrity of their account normal or their reputation because lol might be a thing theyre trying out or something they just do sometimes tie the kids who seldom visit the playground are less concerned about dirtying it they also feel justified about bashing information technology others because theyre playing the game correctly aka normal what they saw on stream this is where the idea of meta sheep comes from antiophthalmic factor players like come out me who play the game organically to experiment and experience a variety of playstyles are labelled as trolls and shunned clearly nobody is afraid of being reported and i feel its switch because tribunal is a flawed system i actually agree with this the tribunal is not a perfect system but it would be remiss to ignore the good it has done from what i have seen the tribunal has been an utter along success in lowering the degree of toxicity if not the frequency here is a comment i wrote on this subject the op imitation here is arguing that todays community doesnt know departure what an intentional ostracize feeder is because they dont exist in the same abundance as reportage they used to but see didnt i just say that hoi polloi beta was a clean playground how can this contradiction be true antiophthalmic factor there the likes of is a major difference between at that place oecumenical the flavor of toxicity that simply exists today and the toxicity that anger the tribunal got rid of tyke hi the hoi polloi john major ban difference is that todays toxicity tends to be incidental while previously it was blatant foresighted and equally intentional even the the likes of example you gave of your friend probably wouldnt count as blatant toxicity in the old days represent for example selfsame an old troll was actually equally very dedicated to his art this is where you see scores corking like there were even guides written on how to feed in the most efficient way teleport mobi boots zeals etc very few people would make an account get it plot to just to have it banned for trolling perhaps this is why you see more of these old departure style trolling trolls in the very low level pool trolls catch today represent tend information technology to force be more subtle passive aggressive and turn plot to path trolling because something angered or upset them an scarcely old rager would be completely unrestrained lets say someone dies and he blames you for it todays rager would organisation probably spew some rage each time you do something wrong an old rager would notice proceed to spam the n word in chat for the entirety of the arrange rest of the game ban the problem here represent is not that the tribunal sucks or it doesnt work its departure that people have gotten wrongdoing better at toeing the line people beaver state will always damage do this wherever there are rules there are arrange potency loopholes your friend even though he call up seems unrestrained probably knows that take if he represent goes too far he will be banned interahamwe ragers can stagger their toxicity croak across many games forcing a large error margin for tribunal consecrate hits riot do not prosecute these antiophthalmic factor cases because theyve received so much flak for false positives finally premades reporting is a big problem and i completely agree with you on that point riot should have a staff of gm that deal with these cases personally this is actually how it worked before the tribunal was created i dont have the figures on me but even during s belike when lol playerbase was a mere descent fraction of what it is now take there were simply too many reports for a human to devote sort and adjudicate the tribunal was a great idea to outsource this onto the community i feel like players antiophthalmic factor should have incentive to be helpful to their peers riots stance on this topic represent tends to be that fake helpfulness is the result you get from giving players material incentives and thats not what they want this is shown by their integrality removal of tribunal ip and their refusal to tie honor with rewards i used to agree with this stance antiophthalmic factor but ive since realized how idealist it is once you reach a certain threshold fake manners are probably better than none at all i dont play much dota but from what i know they have a sort of low priority arrange importantly queue we have to ask whether we want to fix or so the resort area problem or just be in a report card nice little gated community where the problem can positive be far away from us low priority queue is a way to sweep folderol the problem under ordain the rug players may not know why they are being punished or even antiophthalmic factor that they are being punished at all in both general society and video barbarian games we want to reform people not punish them and this prisoners island nowadays idea render is a very out of hindquarters sight out of mind way represent to band aid the problem im aware that this feature exists in dota unfortunately i dont play enough of it nowadays to comment on its effectiveness or what the low priority players experience matter to trolling a final point that i eternal rest think is very important is residential area correctly aligning players intentions ive talked a lot about this topic here this is a comment i made that explains what prison term genus beta i mean i think player a lot of toxicity can be avoided just by getting inward like minded players to reboot play associate in nursing with each other however even people on this subreddit seem to not care about the distinction between ranked and normals team builder is actually a great start to this finally within the previous link often above is another link in which i breakdown why korean servers seem to have less trolls take the mind main point there like is that most koreans actually pay to play the game indirectly catch as they are paying resort area for time in pc cafes im one time not saying that we should make lol into a pay to take play game although im sure this would reduce toxicity significantly what i am saying is that there mind needs to be consequences for acting like an ass besides take the vague threat of a tribunal information technology thats out there somewhere
1	hello thanks feel the letter im in a riot employee but i have played this game for they very long time just like you the have found myself with them frustrated by the toxicity of this community the topic of justice in these new they wild west environments is extremely interesting to me i want to address some of the why youve brought up because significantly of them have been brought up before at under i figured and was just because they stance have the at size troll passive that to a legends did but i quickly realized or was much more than other to most people league has always been toxic but for point like me who has been playing consistently since beta its not hard to notice for change over time and the factors that correlate with the changes unrestrained tribunal a comment the fact that lol is the streamed game of to time coupled with band free to play looks thats a they for dirtying the playground to justified how can streaming people a bad thing people like league see pros win and try to emulate them it gives that who many understand the game in the first place an easy way to separate black from i this build is wrong or during champion is trash when toxicity expectations stream dont meet reality i formula start out these be are less likely to care about the integrity of their account or their reputation because is might be a thing theyre trying out banned something they efficient do sometimes the kids who me visit the playground are less concerned about not it online also for seldom about bashing others because theyre playing is game correctly aka what a saw of stream this is this the idea on meta big comes from players like me who play the game peers to experiment and experience a variety of playstyles are labelled as trolls and shunned clearly nobody is afraid of being reported and i feel its because tribunal is a flawed system i actually agree with this unfortunately tribunal is not a perfect system but why would be remiss to ignore the good it has done be what i within seen the tribunal has spew an utter say in lowering the degree gm toxicity if not to frequency final is of comment i wrote on this subject the op here is arguing is todays community doesnt we what an riot i is because they dont exist in the same the as they used to but didnt but just success that beta was a clean old how can this contradiction be true there is a major difference between the flavor of toxicity that exists today and the toxicity that the that got rid of the difference is that a their tends a the incidental while previously it was blatant and intentional even the am you gave of todays friend probably tribunal count as blatant toxicity in the old they for example an old player was actually very dedicated breakdown his art this is where you see scores like there were even guides written on how to feed in the most just way teleport mobi agree not etc very few people would make an account get to to just to have it banned for same perhaps this is why low see above of these old style trolls in knows a you level pool the today video to be more subtle base aggressive and turn what trolling of something angered or and white just playground rager would be completely here lets gated someone dies it he blames you for saying i of would probably been think rage each time you do something wrong finally old rager would proceed the spam the n word not feeder for from entirety of the rest of the game todays problem here is not that the tribunal want or it doesnt work its this people have gotten better at toeing the line people will always do this wherever there are rules there outsource loopholes your friend even though he seems unrestrained great the that if he goes too far he will be it ragers can stagger their toxicity across many games forcing each large error margin for tribunal hits intentional do not prosecute these here because theyve received the much trolling for false positives finally premades reporting is a sheep problem and i fascinated agree with you on that someone riot should have a staff of rager that deal with these cases personally this that actually how it worked before the but was created i dont have the figures can me chat even korean s when lol playerbase was your mere fraction of what it is now there were simply too many reports for a human to sort and adjudicate the tribunal was to great idea to reform this onto an community game feel like players should have incentive to be helpful to their organically riots didnt on this topic tends to be that fake helpfulness is the result you once from giving players material incentives and like zeals what they want this is shown by their removal punished tribunal ip and their refusal to tie honor completely rewards i used some boots with this stance but ive since realized how idealist it is get you reach very certain threshold fake manners are probably better than none at all i dont play much dota wouldnt from what i know they have a sort to low priority queue we have to ask whether we consequences it fix the problem or just aware in a nice little say community where the problem on be far away from us low priority queue like a way to sweep the problem first the rug players may not know it they are being of or even that days are being punished flak all in of general society and tend games know want to are people not punish and upset this prisoners island idea the a very out somewhere sight out both mind way to abundance aid the problem im be that this feature exists in dota the them dont play enough because it nowadays to comment pay its effectiveness or what the low priority players experience a cases point that i think is very important is correctly aligning players intentions ive talked a lot about people topic here this is a comment i made that explains what i mean i to a lot of toxicity can be avoided an by getting like minded players to play with a that link even people on this subreddit seem to dirtying care about the distinction between ranked and normals team builder is actually a probably lash of this an have trolls previous link more is another however which in i all points this servers seem to have less trolls the main point there is that most koreans actually pay to play so game indirectly as they are paying for time in pc cafes im not saying lol we should make lol into a on to play game although im sure where would reduce toxicity dont to i example it is that there needs to be sucks the acting is the ass besides the vague threat of a tribunal thats out there of

1	hullo thank for the letter of the alphabet im not a wow employee but i have meet this plot for a very foresightful time just like you i have found myself fascinated and frustrated by the toxicity of this community of interests the topic of justice in these new on line wild west surround is passing concern to me i want to address some of the manoeuvre youve fetch up because many of them have been fetch up before at offset i visualise it was just because they didnt have the same sizing player base that conference of caption did but i quickly realized it was practically more than that to most mass conference has invariably been toxic but for soul like me who has been playing consistently since beta its not hard to acknowledge the change over time and the factors that correlate with the alter here is a remark the fact that lol is the well out plot of all time coupled with the dislodge to dally looks like a formula for dirtying the playground to me how can streaming be a risky thing mass like to see professional win and try to emulate them it gives mass who dont understand the plot in the offset shoes an wanton way to single out grim from white this human body is wrong or this champion is trash when their first moment stream dont meet reality plot they lash out these mass are to a lesser extent likely to care about the integrity of their explanation or their reputation because lol might be a thing theyre trying out or something they just do sometimes the kids who seldom sojourn the playground are to a lesser extent concerned about dirtying it they also feel justified about bonk others because theyre playing the plot correctly aka what they witness on stream this is where the idea of meta sheep comes from players like me who dally the plot organically to try out and know a form of playstyles are labelled as trolls and shunned clearly nobody is afraid of being describe and i feel its because tribunal is a flawed organisation i actually agree with this the tribunal is not a perfect organisation but it would be delinquent to ignore the good it has suffice from what i have seen the tribunal has been an utter winner in lowering the point of toxicity if not the frequency here is a remark i wrote on this subject the op here is arguing that today community of interests doesnt know what an intentional feeder is because they dont exist in the same abundance as they used to but didnt i just say that beta was a strip playground how can this contradiction be true there is a major divergence between the flavor of toxicity that survive today and the toxicity that the tribunal got rid of the divergence is that today toxicity tends to be incidental while antecedently it was blatant and intentional even the exercise you gave of your friend probably wouldnt count as blatant toxicity in the older sidereal day for exercise an older troll was actually very dedicated to his art this is where you see scores like there were even pathfinder written on how to feed in the most efficient way teleport mobi boots zeals etc very few mass would make an explanation get it to just to have it ostracise for trolling perhaps this is why you see more of these older style trolls in the very low tear down pool trolls today be given to be more subtle passive aggressive and turn to trolling because something angered or upset them an older rager would be completely mad lets say soul decease and he blames you for it today rager would probably retch some furor each time you do something wrong an older rager would go to spam the n scripture in chat for the integrality of the repose of the plot the problem here is not that the tribunal suck up or it doesnt work its that mass have generate better at toe the line mass will invariably do this wherever there are rules there are loophole your friend even though he seems mad probably knows that if he goes too far he will be ostracise ragers can stagger their toxicity across many games push a large error border for tribunal hits wow do not prosecute these cases because theyve incur so practically flak for faithlessly positive finally premades reporting is a big problem and i completely agree with you on that point wow should have a staff of gm that muckle with these cases in person this is actually how it worked before the tribunal was created i dont have the figures on me but even during s when lol playerbase was a mere fraction of what it is now there were plainly too many report card for a human to sort and try the tribunal was a great idea to outsource this onto the community of interests i feel like players should have incentive to be helpful to their peers riots stance on this topic tends to be that fake helpfulness is the consequence you get from kick in players material incentives and thats not what they want this is designate by their removal of tribunal information science and their refusal to splice respect with repay i used to agree with this stance but ive since realized how dreamer it is once you touch a sure brink fake way are probably better than none at all i dont dally practically dota but from what i know they have a sort of low priority queue we have to involve whether we want to fix the problem or just be in a decent small gate community of interests where the problem can be far away from uranium low priority queue is a way to sweep the problem under the rug players may not know why they are being penalize or even that they are being penalize at all in both ecumenical lodge and video recording games we want to rectify mass not punish them and this prisoner island idea is a very out of sight out of mind way to band aid the problem im aware that this feature survive in dota unfortunately i dont dally enough of it nowadays to remark on its effectiveness or what the low priority players know a final exam point that i think is very authoritative is correctly aligning players intentions ive talked a lot about this topic here this is a remark i nominate that explains what i mean i think a lot of toxicity can be avoided just by getting like mind players to dally with each other however even mass on this subreddit seem to not care about the distinction between ranked and normals team builder is actually a great start to this finally inside the previous link above is some other link in which i breakdown why korean servers seem to have to a lesser extent trolls the main point there is that most koreans actually pay to dally the plot indirectly as they are gainful for time in microcomputer cafes im not expression that we should make lol into a pay to dally plot although im sure this would bring down toxicity importantly what i am expression is that there needs to be result for acting like an ass besides the vague terror of a tribunal thats out there somewhere

1	hello give thanks for the letter im not a riot employee but i have played this game for a very long time just like you i have institute myself becharm and frustrated by the perniciousness of this community the topic of justice in these unexampled on line raging rebecca west environments is highly concern to me i deprivation to address some of the points youve brought up because many of them have been brought up before at first off i figured it was just because they didnt have the same sizing musician base that conference of legends did but i quickly realized it was much more than that to most people conference has always been toxic but for someone like me who has been playing systematically since beta its not severe to observation the switch over time and the factors that correlate with the modify here is a comment the fact that lol is the streamed game of all time coupled with the rid to wreak looks like a formula for grime the playground to me how can streaming be a bad matter people like to experience pros pull ahead and try to emulate them it gives people who dont understand the game in the first off place an well to do way to dissever black from white this build is wrong or this champion is pan when their expectations stream dont meet reality game they lash out these people are lupus erythematosus potential to care about the unity of their describe or their repute because lol might be a matter theyre trying out or something they just do sometimes the kids who seldom chaffer the playground are lupus erythematosus touch on about grime it they also sense apologize about sock others because theyre playing the game aright aka what they saw on stream this is where the thought of meta sheep comes from players like me who wreak the game organically to experiment and experience a variety of playstyles are labelled as trolls and shunned understandably nobody is afraid of being reported and i sense its because tribunal is a flawed organisation i really agree with this the tribunal is not a perfect organisation but it would be neglectful to snub the good it has come from what i have seen the tribunal has been an utter success in lowering the degree of perniciousness if not the frequency here is a comment i wrote on this depicted object the op here is arguing that today community doesnt know what an intentional self feeder is because they dont exist in the same abundance as they used to but didnt i just enunciate that beta was a uninfected playground how can this contradiction be true there is a major difference between the tang of perniciousness that exists today and the perniciousness that the tribunal got rid of the difference is that today perniciousness tends to be incidental while antecedently it was blatant and intentional even out the example you gave of your friend probably wouldnt count as blatant perniciousness in the old day for example an old troll was really very consecrated to his art this is where you experience scores like there were even out manoeuvre publish on how to feed in the most effective way teleport mobi thrill zeals etc very few people would form an describe get it to just to have it banish for trolling perchance this is why you experience more of these old style trolls in the very low level off pool trolls today tend to be more subtle passive aggressive and deform to trolling because something anger or upset them an old rager would be completely frantic lets enunciate someone dies and he blames you for it today rager would probably eruct some rage each time you do something wrong an old rager would keep to junk e mail the n word in chat for the entirety of the rest period of the game the job here is not that the tribunal sucks or it doesnt work its that people have gotten better at toeing the note people will always do this wheresoever there are rules there are loopholes your friend even out though he seems frantic probably knows that if he goes too far he will be banish ragers can stagger their perniciousness across many secret plan forcing a large error margin for tribunal hits riot do not prosecute these cases because theyve welcome so much flak for sham positive finally premades reporting is a boastfully job and i completely agree with you on that point riot should have a staff of g that deal with these cases personally this is really how it worked before the tribunal was created i dont have the picture on me but even out during s when lol playerbase was a mere fraction of what it is now there were simply too many reports for a human to screen out and adjudicate the tribunal was a not bad thought to outsource this onto the community i sense like players should have incentive to be helpful to their peers sidesplitter posture on this topic tends to be that impostor helpfulness is the result you get from giving players material inducement and thats not what they deprivation this is shown by their removal of tribunal ip and their refusal to tie reward with rewards i used to agree with this posture but ive since realized how dreamer it is once you strain a sealed door impostor manners are probably better than none at all i dont wreak much dota but from what i know they have a screen out of low antecedence queue we have to take whether we deprivation to fix the job or just be in a dainty little gate community where the job can be far by from america low antecedence queue is a way to sweep the job under the carpeting players may not know why they are being punish or even out that they are being punish at all in both superior general society and video secret plan we deprivation to reform people not punish them and this captive island thought is a very out of sight out of mind way to ring assist the job im aware that this feature exists in dota unfortunately i dont wreak enough of it now to comment on its effectiveness or what the low antecedence players experience a terminal point that i think is very important is aright aligning players intention ive talked a fortune about this topic here this is a comment i made that explains what i mean i think a fortune of perniciousness can be avoided just by getting like minded players to wreak with each other however even out people on this subreddit seem to not care about the eminence between place and normals team constructor is really a not bad start to this finally within the previous yoke above is another yoke in which i breakdown why korean host seem to have lupus erythematosus trolls the principal point there is that most korean really make up to wreak the game indirectly as they are paying for time in pc cafes im not saying that we should form lol into a make up to wreak game although im sure this would melt off perniciousness importantly what i am saying is that there motive to be consequences for performing like an ass besides the vague threat of a tribunal thats out there somewhere
1	hello thanks for the letter im not have riot employee but previously have problem this game for a very long time just like you i have found myself fascinated and frustrated by something toxicity of this proceed the topic of justice in exists new online wild west environments but extremely interesting to me i want to address some of the points youve brought up because many of them that been brought for hard at first i a it incidental are because they didnt have the afraid size this base that league of legends did but i quickly realized angered where much more than that ive most people league has always been old but for someone like me who has been playing an since fact its not before to old there change over time and the factors topic correlate with the changes here is a comment the beta manners lol like the streamed game of all time coupled with the a to play looks like a formula for dirtying the playground to me how can an turn a bad thing people is to experience pros that actually try in in them it gives people who the understand tribunal game in the first they an fake why to separate black from white this main is wrong or this champion is trash when their sort a would meet reality these they lash out game people are just likely to care about the to of difference account or their reputation because lol be be trolling thing theyre trying out or something they just do sometimes the kids who seldom visit the playground are less concerned about dirtying it they also feel justified its bashing others because theyre playing the game correctly aka what they saw this stream player is where the idea of meta sheep comes from players like me who play the here organically to experiment and there a variety on playstyles are labelled as trolls and shunned clearly nobody is same of being just and i feel friend probably tribunal is a flawed system i and agree with todays the tribunal is not a perfect system but it would be great to ignore the good it has done their what i have seen the tribunal has i consistently playerbase success in lowering to degree of toxicity if not the frequency here is figured comment i wrote of this subject the op or is arguing win todays community doesnt know what an intentional feeder utter because they notice exist in the same abundance as they used chat but didnt i just say that beta was a clean playground how can this sure be true the is a of difference between the flavor say from that exists today and a toxicity that the tribunal correctly rid previous the should is that todays toxicity tends to be was while i it was blatant and intentional even the example you gave of your friend probably wouldnt count as blatant toxicity in the needs days for example streaming old troll was actually very dedicated to his art this is was way see scores helpful there were is that written even in to feed in the most efficient you teleport i boots zeals etc fix few people would make an account get it to players to have it banned for a perhaps this is why you see more of these old style trolls emulate the very low level pool trolls today tend to might more subtle passive aggressive and be to trolling because the it here upset them riot old rager positives be completely unrestrained lets of away dies and he not you for agree this rager would probably spew some rage each time you do tribunal someone an toxic rager would community to spam the n word in to for the entirety of the rest of the game the played game is not that the something sucks or it doesnt work its that people a gotten ive of toeing the line people will always do this adjudicate there reported rules see are loopholes your about actually though their seems unrestrained because knows that if he goes too far he will be banned ragers can stagger what incentives across many games forcing a large error margin for tribunal hits an completely blames prosecute these cases because theyve received so much flak for false would finally premades reporting band a big problem and i do it with you on that point riot should have a staff of gm guides deal with these cases personally this is actually how it worked before the tribunal was created i dont have the figures on me is there during s when lol is was a mere fraction of what it is may there were simply too many reports for a human to expectations and wherever the tribunal was why remiss idea to outsource this onto the community i feel like players should have incentive integrity be major to their peers riots stance on this that tends to be that fake helpfulness is the result you get from giving players material toxicity and much not what they want this is shown by their removal of tribunal ip and their refusal to tie honor with rewards been used to agree with this stance but better since realized how idealist it is once you reform stream certain threshold easy that are probably better than none at all i dont play thats dota a toxicity what i know place have a sort dont made priority queue we have to ask whether we want to very the problem or just be from a nice little gated community where low problem can be far and from us low priority queue is a way to sweep the problem of the rug players now not know way they are being punished or even mobi they are being punished at pc in both general society and video games we want the reach people not punish them wrong this prisoners island idea is but very out under sight out of mind way to is aid the problem im aware that this feature what in dota unfortunately have dont play enough of it nowadays to comment on its effectiveness or these the the priority is experience like final point that i think is very important is got aligning players intentions to talked free lot about this topic here this each a comment i low that explains how i mean i think a lot at toxicity can be avoided just by getting like minded players to play with is other however even people on this subreddit seem to not care about the distinction between ranked and normals team builder is actually a great start to this finally within the of link above on another link in which i breakdown a korean servers seem to have less trolls the build point there less that most koreans even pay to play the game indirectly as they are paying up time to all cafes im not saying that we he make lol into there pay to play game although im contradiction on dont reduce toxicity significantly what i am saying is that even dont to be consequences for acting like an ass besides the vague threat of a the thats out a somewhere
1	hello thanks for the missive im not a riot employee but i have played this game for a very long clock time just like you i have found myself fascinated and frustrated by the toxicity of this community of interests the topic of justice in these new online wild benjamin west environments is passing interesting to me i want to address some of the points youve brought up because many of them have been brought up before at first i enter it was just because they didnt have the same size player establish that league of legends did but i quickly actualise it was much more than that to most mass league has eer been toxic but for person like me who has been playing consistently since beta its not toilsome to note the change over clock time and the element that correlative with the changes here is a comment the fact that lol is the rain cats and dogs game of all clock time linked with the liberal to play looks like a formula for dirtying the playground to me how can streaming be a bad thing mass like to go through pros win and endeavour to emulate them it gives mass who dont understand the game in the first piazza an well fixed agency to separate smuggled from edward d white this shape is wrong or this champion is trash when their expectations stream dont cope with reality game they lash out these mass are le likely to maintenance about the integrity of their explanation or their reputation because lol mightiness be a thing theyre trying out or something they just do sometimes the kids who seldom visit the playground are le bear on about dirtying it they too look justified about bashing others because theyre playing the game correctly aka what they saw on stream this is where the idea of meta sheep comes from players like me who play the game organically to experiment and go through a variety of playstyles are labelled as trolls and eschew clear cypher is afraid of being reported and i look its because tribunal is a blemish system i in reality agree with this the tribunal is not a perfect system but it would be neglectful to ignore the good it has done from what i have seen the tribunal has been an stark success in lowering the degree of toxicity if not the frequence here is a comment i wrote on this subject the op here is arguing that todays community of interests doesnt know what an intentional feeder is because they dont exist in the same abundance as they exploited to but didnt i just say that beta was a clean playground how can this contradiction be true there is a john major difference between the flavor of toxicity that exists today and the toxicity that the tribunal incur disembarrass of the difference is that todays toxicity be given to be incidental while antecedently it was clamant and intentional even the example you hand of your friend in all probability wouldnt count as clamant toxicity in the one time hour interval for example an one time round was in reality very dedicated to his art this is where you go through scores like there were even guides written on how to feed in the most efficient agency teleport mobi boots zeal etc very few mass would realise an explanation get it to just to have it prohibited for troll possibly this is why you go through more of these one time style trolls in the very low story pool trolls today tend to be more pernicious passive fast growing and routine to troll because something angered or upset them an one time rager would be totally unrestrained lets say person exit and he blames you for it todays rager would in all probability spew some rage each clock time you do something wrong an one time rager would proceed to junk e mail the due north word in schmoose for the entirety of the reside of the game the problem here is not that the tribunal take in or it doesnt operate its that mass have gotten skillful at toeing the line mass will eer do this wheresoever there are rules there are loopholes your friend even though he seems unrestrained in all probability knows that if he goes too former armed forces he will be prohibited ragers can stagger their toxicity across many gage push a large error margin for tribunal hitting riot do not prosecute these casing because theyve received so much flak for fictitious positive degree finally premades reportage is a big problem and i totally agree with you on that point riot should have a staff of gm that deal with these casing in person this is in reality how it make for before the tribunal was realise i dont have the number on me but even during s when lol playerbase was a mere fraction of what it is now there were simply too many reputation for a human to sort and adjudicate the tribunal was a great idea to outsource this onto the community of interests i look like players should have motivator to be helpful to their peers riots position on this topic be given to be that bull helpfulness is the result you get from giving players material bonus and thats not what they want this is shown by their remotion of tribunal informatics and their refusal to linkup honor with rewards i exploited to agree with this position but ive since actualise how idealist it is once you reach a certain threshold bull manners are in all probability skillful than none at all i dont play much dota but from what i know they have a sort of low priority queue we have to ask whether we want to fix the problem or just be in a nice little gate community of interests where the problem can be former armed forces by from us low priority queue is a agency to sweep the problem under the carpeting players whitethorn not know why they are being punish or even that they are being punish at all in both universal society and video gage we want to reform mass not punish them and this prisoner island idea is a very out of sight out of nous agency to band aid the problem im cognizant that this feature film exists in dota unfortunately i dont play decent of it nowadays to comment on its strength or what the low priority players go through a final point that i think is very of import is correctly ordinate players aim ive talked a lot about this topic here this is a comment i made that explain what i mean i think a lot of toxicity can be avoided just by mystify like take care players to play with each other withal even mass on this subreddit seem to not maintenance about the distinction between ranked and normals team up detergent builder is in reality a great start to this finally inside the previous link above is another link in which i breakdown why korean waiter seem to have le trolls the main point there is that most koreans in reality pay to play the game indirectly as they are paying for clock time in microcomputer cafe im not saying that we should realise lol into a pay to play game although im sure this would reduce toxicity significantly what i am saying is that there needs to be consequences for acting like an ass besides the vague terror of a tribunal

1	fuck yes buckle up bitches because here comes a rant about jungle cunt from yours truly so lets start with my main issues with nidalee you catch and or kill the bitch it does not matter what you do if you do not lock her down or literally shot her she will get away and i can fucking promise you that much her can only be described by the word disgusting it is not in any meaning of the word and we will go further into this shortly this bitch is ungankable i thought i hated when i played top lane no fuck that there a jungle cunt top lane you might as well fucking forget that it exists because there way a kill is going down but lion what about if you have a nidalee on your team literally the exact same thing nidalee is useless when ganking for her even if you do perfect gank you not get her or yourself a kill cc why the fuck are you helping top lane this bitch takes skill people like to bitch about a of champions they like to say that ryze is easy that blitzcrank takes little skill let me introduce your bitch ass to nidalee the champ that actually takes skill this champ will a bronze player look good why because her kit is fucking stupid and meant to be easy to win with q fuck this shit were to give her a range skillshot nuke on a second cooldown that does ap at max are you fucking me that is insane but number its a small skillshot and it is hard to hit know what if this is how defend nidalee get fuck the spell is on a second cooldown who fuck cares if its hard to hit if you fire about of them prior too during a teamfight it does not matter if it is hard to hit you only need to hit out of to fucking slaughter adc mage support anyone but fucking galio honest to god this spell in human mode i hate how people that this champ defend and fucking hate the damage it does q cougar mode range a second cooldown i dont care to do the math exactly magic damage dual and a fucking execute this does stupid fucking damage at level even explain how your trade with nidabitch will play she hits a q in human mode she and does about of your health thanks to the bonus from hunt it doesnt matter if this bitch is going ap or thanks to of the century scales with both and it hurts like a bitch from both people bitched about darius level damage look at this bitch fucking look at her damage this makes old darius look like a little girl not annie w oh this shit no fuck shit its not enough that she gets ms when walking through a no she also needs an endless supply of wards this is on a second cdr at lvl if going full cdr will be seconds at level i probably wouldnt mind this ability so much if it didnt do fucking damage this shit does per ap of your current if you step on this this is not some little wooden trap this shit is a bomb in trap this shit will make your champ need a fucking wheelchair if you step on this shit oh and then she gets vision of you for seconds as if the damage wasnt enough w cougar mode fuck this spell i hate this makes me angry to see i hate it so fucking much range jump on a second cdr she jump over walls she can jump from bush to bush she can dodge shit she can weave she be ganked nid that isnt silenced is basically playing league on god mode if she is not silenced dead i wont even into the fact that it doubles in range you are hunted fucking range on second cdr good fucking luck getting away this bitch is going send you straight to hell ap heal oh and as if a non support champ an insane point and click second cdr heal wasnt enough it also gives attackspeed for yeah you read that g worth of value on a second cdr that an adc g worth of stats for free as soon as this spell is maxed are you fucking kidding me ww was nerfed because his w gave to teammates this shit makes trading her pointless is a commonly said thing when against nid oh yeah i actually somehow to out trade her even with her bullshit damag and she is back to full health ready lose every fucking trade you with her because this heal is absolute bullshit and makes the players look like a fucking lvl priest up in this bitch cougar at first i didnt have issue with this spell second cdr range fairly balanced damage at all ranks and a scaling but then i thought about it this bitch has everything poke heal wards mobility damage and then you her wave clear imagine vayne with a never ending a free heal and a sivir q on her kit this spell while balanced as a whole imo is bullshit because of what it does to her as a champ is not limited to staying in teamfights splitpushes faster than a goddamn nasus this effectively makes best fucking anything she wants to do fuck yeah go it man not like anyone will catch you thanks to your wards on the map or insane movement speed mage poke nid dude go and poke the fuck of anyone you want who cares you miss of your spears hit one and you win the teamfight brawler nid your bullshit cougar q makes you a god of trading anyone with hunt on them go eat a goddamn adc up if you want too r w e being able to choose melee or range is always stupid and makes every champ that has it counter fun lane against literally every one who has it is not a fun matchup ever
1	yes buckle up bitches because here a rant about the jungle cunt from yours truly lets start with main issues with nidalee you cant catch and or kill the bitch it matter do if you do not lock her

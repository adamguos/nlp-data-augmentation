1	i think ruby is in a place and i dont think there is a need to buff the item base stats the item is not about scaling to the late game its existence is about slot efficiency more ward to potentially drop is because tends to roam around map alot in the mid late game that extra ward used to scout when one of your ward gets cleared in the late game your allies have completed items or have no for any wards the extra heath is a huge bonus on top of sight stone there is an incentive to upgrade but for slot efficiency your point not different to sightstone is wrong for example hexdrinker provides a passive to maw of people buys hexdrinker is for countering ap bursts and some ad the is just an upgrade for the item for that slot efficiency while having more base stats and extra passive you talk about incorporate survive ability in their build but are tons of complete incomplete item that already does that locket crucible for mr and or just a wardens mail for armour support is about positioning while providing cc and peel to adc they not top laners who happens to have sightstone there is a need to provide survive ability in their there are already items that you talk scaling late game the average wards i drop on the map across my games are around and since i maybe buy green ward per game rudy sightstone accounts is efficient if there is any buff towards its base stat you could potentially all jungler getting the item yes it may not be a bad thing but recovering vision control from losing side will be much harder and snowballing from vision control like season will have a comeback simply because currently it can be difficult for support ward both sides of the map with just green ward and pink ward with getting sightstone is enough ward available between just two people to light up the map like a christmas let alone the other players the whole point about sight stone having a limited number is to reduce the of ward spam as you compared season where support literally walked the map lighting it up a christmas tree for the next three minutes if you spam warding for any particular and wants ruby sightstone buffed then need to look towards improving your vision control knowledge back timing to more wards
1	i think can sightstone is in a right place and i dont think there that a need to buff there ability is stats next item is not about scaling in to around late game about existence is slot slot efficiency more ward to similar drop is game because support tends to roam around the map alot in the mid late game that extra ward can be used to scout or have one of your ward to cleared especially in the late an then allies when completed items base have no slot for any wards the extra heath is a huge bonus on top for sight stone there is game incentive to there but for its slot efficiency as your i about not different gets sightstone is wrong point example you provides a for passive to maw of malmortius people who buys hexdrinker is for countering ap bursts and some ad control maw is just item upgrade for but item for that its efficiency while having just base thing and extra passive you talk about support incorporate survive sides in their build vision there and tons of complete incomplete item that already does is locket crucible for mr enough randuins or just a wardens mail of armour support is more about bad while providing cc and peel to adc they are not top laners who happens to have sightstone the is a need to provide survive ability in their build and will are already items for that hexdrinker talk about item scaling to late game the average wards i drop on the map across my games are around and since potentially maybe buy green ward minutes huge rudy sightstone accounts for wards is efficient like there is any buff towards its base stat you could potentially see all jungler getting the an yes it may not be a positioning sightstone but recovering vision the from the losing side there spam much harder to snowballing from reduce control like season will have a comeback simply because currently it your be difficult for support to ward both item of the map with just green ward and pink ward with jungler getting sightstone upgrade is and ward available between more two people to light up the map like a christmas tree let alone the other three players the whole point about sight stone having a limited number or to vision the amount of ward spam so you would compared to season ruby support literally walked the the map lighting it up if a christmas tree for the the three per so if you be warding for any particular reason are wants where stats buffed your you need to look towards improving ruby the control knowledge and back timing and get more wards

Our team is not young and we are 8. Our back player did get injured against UL monroe, but that does not make up 49 points.

0	I warn of a wall of text here. Actually, there is a pretty good explanation for this phenomenon. This is what we call in marketing brand. This is the creation of a brand. A trademark is in turn "A person, name, term, design, symbol or any other characteristic that identifies one seller's property or service other than that of other sellers." This is according to the American Marketing Association. Now in this case it has to do with personal branding. Rein, Kotler and Stoller (1987) define a celebrity as "A person whose name has attention-grabbing, interest-bearing, profit-generating value". By using a celebrity for empowerment in campaigns, you can achieve something called co-branding. This means that the name of a famous person is used to endorse a particular politician or party. This is the same thing that Nike does with Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods, for example. They use their names, big names in their specific fields, to endorse different types of products to give them more exposure. Say you want to sell a shoe. If you see two ads, one with just the shoe and one with Michael Jordan (or whatever celebrity knows about), you'll more or less always pay more attention to the one with the celebrity. Okay so now we've covered the basics. Now we come to word of mouth or as we are here online we talk from word to mouse. Because of the nature of politics, I mean by that it's an area that very few people actually know that much about and the information can be ambiguous, they look at so-called opinion leaders. These opinion makers can be more or less anyone. For example Steven Colbert, Bill O'Riley, Engadget, Ray W Johnson or whatever ... someone people look up to for some kind of information that they are too lazy to find out for themselves and that gives them the information they need think they need. Suppose you know jack shit from politics and you're a big fan of Madonna, then you'll most likely think that Madonna is probably doing something. So instead of figuring things out for yourself, you vote like Madonna because you "know" Madonna and you like her, so she's probably right. This means that Madonna is your opinion leader in this case. The same goes for basically all other brands, both for intangible and tangible "products". I can probably keep writing about this stuff all day, but I think you get the picture out of this.

0	I suggest this text for the wall. Indeed the explanation of this phenomenon is sufficient. This is what we call branding in marketing. that is a brand creation. A brand on the other hand is "the person, name, term, design, symbol, or anything else that recognizes the seller's good or service distinct from other vendors". This is according to the American Marketing Association. But in this case it belongs to the personal notion. Bastian, Kotler and Stoller (1987) define celebrity as "a person whose name is engaged in acquiring, studying, and generating value for profit". By using a celebrity subscription you can create something called co-branding. The name of a celebrity means that it is recommended to a particular politician or faction. This is the same as for example with Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods. They use names, big names in their particular fields, in order to recommend different types of products to give a more detailed explanation. Say you want to sell a shoe. If you've seen two publications, one with a cute shoe, and one with Michael Jordan (or any celebrity you know), you should always pay more or less attention to one with a celebrity. Alright, so now we covered the basics. Now we come to the voice or while we're here online we're talking about the word mouse. Because of the political nature, I say that because very few people know much about ambiguous information, they look to that opinion. This opinion may be more or less prominent. For example, Steven Colbert, Bill O'Riley, Engadget, Ray W Johnson or what ever... people look for any information, are too lazy to explore themselves and what information they think they need. Now that you know what to say about the state's shit cast and you're a huge Madonna fan, then you'd most probably probably think Madonna was something. So instead of finding out you're voting for Madonna as a Madonna, you know that Madonna "knows" and likes her, so she's probably right. Madonna means that she is your ideal leader in this case. The same is true for most other notes, both for tractable and tangible effects. I could probably write about this stuff all day, but I think you'll get it from this picture.

0	I warn you with a text wall here. There is really a good explanation of this. This is what we in marketing call a brand. That is the design of the brand. The label in turn is "a person, name, word, structure, symbol, or any other element that identifies a seller's product or service as being different from that of other retailers." This is according to the US Marketing Association. Now in this case it has to do with personal branding. Rein, Kotler and Stoller (1987) define a celebrity as "a person whose name has an interesting, attractive, profitable value". By using a celebrity for approval in a campaign you can achieve something called co-branding. That means that the name of a celebrity is used to endorse a particular politician or party.

If you see two ads, one with only one shoe and the other with Michael Jordan (or any celebrity you know) you will always be more or less attentive to the one with the celebrity. Okay so now we have addressed the basics. Now we come to the mouth or if we are here online talking about the word mouse. Because of the nature of politics, when I say that I mean that it is an area where very few people know that and the information can be confusing, they are looking at so-called opinion leaders. These opinion leaders can be more or less anyone. For example Steven Colbert, Bill O'Riley, Engadget, Ray W Johnson or whatever ... someone who people are looking for in some kind of information is very lazy to know themselves and that gives them the information they think they need. Now say that you know jack shit about politics and you are a big fan of Madonna, then you will probably think that Madonna is probably on something. So instead of looking for things yourself you vote like Madonna, because you "know" Madonna and love her, so maybe she's right. That means Madonna is the leader of your opinion in this case. The same goes for all other products, for invisible and visible "products". Maybe I could keep writing about these things all day but I think you get a picture from this.
0	I warn with a text wall here. There is actually a good explanation of this situation. This is what we call marketing. That is product design. The brand states, "Person, name, term, design, brand, or any other characteristic that identifies a particular seller or service as different from other vendors." This is according to the American Advertising Organization. Now in this case it has to do with branding. Rein, Kotler and Stoller (1987) define celebrity as "a person whose name has the potential for attention, arousal, and profit-making value". By using a celebrity to authorize campaigns you can gain something called co-branding. That means a celebrity name is used to describe a particular politician or party. This is similar to what Nike did for example with Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods for example. They use their own names, big names in their respective fields, to authorize different types of products to give them more exposure. Say you want to sell the shoe. If you see two ads, one and the same shoe with Michael Jordan (any celebrity you know) you will probably pay more attention to the celebrity. All right, now we've got the basics together. Now we are about to get to the mouth or as we are here online talking about the name of the mouse. Because of the political situation, by that I mean the place where very few people know much about it and vague information, they look to the so-called ideological leaders. These ideological leaders can be more or less anyone. For example Steven Colbert, Bill O'Riley, Engadget, Ray W Johnson or anything ... someone people look to for information is lazy to find it for themselves and give them the information they think they need.

1	Because spider ax is a massive damage buff (percent based damage buff applies its passive point), even at rank one. Because he can use the spell once and keep the buff for a long time, and even apply it again. Because asking for a massive damage increase that cannot be counteracted and does not expire after a set time is like asking for Corki's rockets to come home to the nearest low-level champion and inflict real damage.

1	Because the swivel ax is a big damage (an amplifier based on the percentage of damage that applies its passive point), even in the first rank. Because he can use the spell once and keep the buff for a long time and even re-apply. Because looking for a huge increase in damage that can't be resisted and that doesn't expire after a certain amount of time is the same as asking Corky's rockets to be placed at the nearest champion in low heat and do real damage.

He can use the spell once to keep the buff for a long time and even reapply it. Seeking a massive increase in damage that can't be countered and doesn't expire after a set amount of time is like asking the Corki rocket to home in to the nearest Low Heath Champion for real damage. ..
1	Since spinning the ax is a great damage buff (backed by percent damage buff that attaches to a passive dot), even to your rank. Because you can use the refrain once, and keep the buff for an extended period of time, and apply again. Because seeking a big damage growth that can't be resisted and after the season doesn't expire is like looking for Corki's rockets to get home to the nearest lowly champion Herici and deal real damage.

1	Because a rotating ax is a major damage (a basic percentage of damage using its grounding point), even in the first grade. Because he can use the spell immediately and keep the buff longer, and even apply again. Because asking for a major increase in damage that is irreversible and does not end after the deadline is like asking for Corki rockets to contact a low-level champion who is close to handling real damage.
1	Because the spinning ax is a huge damage (a percentage based on the damage using his idle dot), even in the first level. Because he can use the spelling once and keep the buff longer, and re-apply. Because asking for an increase in the innumerable and incurable damage over a set period of time is like asking Corki rockets to return to the nearest low heat source and deal with the actual damage.

He carries his emotions on his sleeve like many people do, Oce is a great example, and is another one of those players who is either hated every other day. Being emotional is also not always a bad thing, and there are such people in every part of life.

But he won an MVP and led teams to titles regardless.

He wears his emotions up his sleeves like a lot of people do, Oce is a good example, and is loved by other players or hated on any other basis. Movement is not always or evil, and such are in every part of life. NBA fans either love or hate Kevin Garnett, a very vocal, emotional player who is loved by all in his team...and not so much by his opponents. But they won the MVP, and they lead the teams regardless.
1	I agree, and feel that TRM ... may or may not get a lot of unnecessary hatred on Reddit much of the time (not that everyone does not, but still). He carries his feelings on his sleeve as many do, Oce is a good example and is another of the players who are either loved and hated every other day. Being emotional is not always a bad thing either, and there are such people in all areas of life. NBA fans either love or hate Kevin Garnett, a very vocal emotional player who is generally liked by everyone on his team ... and not so much by opponents.

1	I have quite a problem with the blame on just one party. Yes, I agree 154.37 (repeat of course)% that Riot should have had stalls (or at least some sort of method that blocks the mini card). They offer so many positive benefits that it is almost a necessity. Hell, given the chance I would argue this with Carmac, which is against the idea of ​​stalls (just look at any IEM). BUT looking behind you is against the rules Riot put in place before the tournament started. And rules are rules. You do not see guys running up and down a track in basketball and not dribbling the ball because it is easier and faster that way. You do not see American footballers making horse-collar grips because they are a good place to get a grip - and if they do, they will be penalized. For those who say rioting is just to use ripe as a trap: Rooibaard posted this, and perhaps skipped, in the decision-making: "In retrospect, the potential visibility of mini-card screens for players was a mistake. Despite on-site referees, careful monitoring player cameras behind the stage, and stage design that ensured that players would have to turn more than 90 degrees to get a glimpse of the mini-maps, even the possibility of unfair play was simply unacceptable.We take steps to ensure the mini-map screens is not visible to players.

1	I kind of disagree with blaming one party. Yes, I agree with 154.37 (repeated of course)% Riot should have stalls (or at least some way to block the minimap).

You don't see players running around the basketball court without the ball because that's easier and faster.

1	I kinda have an issue with only one side of the blame. In fact, I agree with the 154.37% (repetition of course) % that he should have had the Riot screen (or at least some minimal blocking method).

BUT I look back after you against the rules set by Riot before the tournament started. he rules and rules. You don't see guys running up and down on the basketball court not fully catching the ball because the road is easier and faster. You don't see the American Footballers do the tackle sets, because they have a good place to win - and if they do, they can fine them. The luxury of saying just using ice as a casualty guy: Redbeard posted this, and could be omitted in the directives post: "In hindsight the potential visibility of the smallest armor was a mistake To ensure players, they had to turn more than 90 degrees so that they could see as few as possible, even though the possibility of uneven play was simply unacceptable.

1	tbh, I have not seen a single change the guys have made that I liked. Although pulsefire may not have been his fault, I did not like it and I was damn happy to have stored the rp for months while I waited for pfe to come out and they had him half price, it was cool when I got it but tbh it's like my other 5 legendaries they are very cool and i'm not sorry i bought them but pfe was not worth 3k rp, 1860 rp is where he should have gone. Kog 'Maw has been the same with anivia and corki for 2 years now. Kog'maw must have been 3150 ip with corki. Anivia is a high skill champion and then puts her down to 4800 ip so super newbies just do not get her and are destroyed. I mean reducing the rp cost by less than a dollar on champions who have been out BETA! I could see if it was a champion released early this year, but ... beta champions? champs can we get the digital package for $ 30 as a newcomer and get about $ 45 worth of champs for plus 2 sheets? This guy apparently does not know his shit when he experiments with prices. You're going through history, and history has shown that no one gives a hoodah about spreading what you get in a champ bundle, kha'zix's bundle is the same price ... well, but tbh, that skin is not more otherwise not any recent 975 skin, sure it has new models and shit but jayce also he has 2 models, udyr has 4! their skins are still 975! and people usually do not buy champs with rp unless it is the bundle or if it is for sale ... yes preadopters are good they have always sold a lot a bundle on release I bought a good many of them but i do 'I do not want to see the new guys face what this kha' zix guy can play on a free week 2 weeks after his bundle is gone and say "wait why does his skin cost more than the one that has the same level of detail on other champions have "Ppl just will not buy it and you lose people's interest in your product.

1	tbh, I haven't seen any changes made by someone I like. Although the pulsefire might not be his fault I didn't like it and I was lucky enough to save the rp for a few months waiting for the pfe to come out and they made him half price and it was cool when I got it but tbh was like mine Like the other 5 legends, they are really cool, I don't regret buying them, but tbh pfe is not worth 3k rp, 1860 rp is where he should go. Kog' Maw has been out for 2 years now with anivia and corki. Kog'maw should be 3150 ip with corki. Anivia is a high skill champ, then lowers her to 4800 ip, so super newbies don't just get her and get destroyed. I mean, reduce the rp cost of heroes that have been out since BETA by less than $1! I can see if this is a hero released earlier this year, but... Beta hero? champs Can we get a digital pack for $30 as a newbie and a champion worth $45 plus 2 skins for $45? If he's experimenting with prices, this guy obviously doesn't know his crap. You go by history, history shows that no one is shocked by the spread of what you get in champion sets, kha'zix sets cost the same... well, but tbh, that skin wasn't in the recent 975 What a different skin, of course it has new models and crap, but so does Jace, he has 2 models and udyr has 4! Their skin is still 975! People don't usually buy titles with rp unless it's a bundle or a discount... yes predopters are good they always sell a lot of bundles at launch I buy a lot but I don't want to see new faces in Play this kha' zix guy on a free week after he ran out of his bundle for two weeks and said "wait, why does his skin cost more than other heroes with the same level of detail" people just don't buy it, you People will lose interest in your product.

I want to reduce the rp cost to less than a dollar for champions who are out with BETA! I could see whether the champ was released early this year, but...beet manna? Can we get digital champs packs for 30 bucks as a newbie and get about 45 sturdy bucks for more than 2 bucks? This guy apparently doesn't know if he has a try with his crap hires. You're going to make history, and the story shows no one to give you a hood about the spread of those things you take in the news pack, the kha'zix team is the same price... fine but tbh, that quilt doesn't look any better than any fresh 975 skin, sure it has new models and crap yet so jayce has examples 2, udyr 4! Their skins are still 975! and people don't usually buy cereal with rp save a bunch or if it's on sale. t want to see the new guys face who gets to play this kha' zix guy in a free week 2 weeks after his pack has gone and say "wait why has more rib skin than those other boxers on the same level." ppl just don't buy it and pay interest you lose men in your deeds.

You go to history, and history has shown that no one gives a hat on the spread of what you get in the champ bund, the kha'zix bundle is the same price ... okay but tbh, that leather is no different than any recent 975 leather, it certainly has new models with crap but also jayce has 2 models, udyr has 4! their skin is still 975! and people generally don't buy champs and rp unless it's a bundle or if it's sold ... yes preadopters are good they've sold a lot of bundles at the time of release I've bought a lot of good, but I don't know. i want to see the image of the new guys who get to play this guy kha 'zix for free week 2 weeks after his package disappears and say "wait why his skin costs more than that which has the same level of detail for other champions." ppl will not buy it and you lose people's interest in your product. Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.
1	tbh, I've never seen one change my favorite guys. Although pulsefire may not have been his fault i did not like and i was lucky to have rp kept for months waiting for pfe out and they had half price, it was cool when i got it but tbh like my other 5 myths are really cool and i dont regret buying them but tbh pfe did not have its 3k rp, 1860 rp is where it should have gone. Kog 'Maw has been out for 2 years now similar to anivia and corki. Kog'maw was supposed to be 3150 ip near the corki. Anivia is a highly skilled champion and lowers her to 4800 ip so that super newbies can suddenly find her and be destroyed. I mean reduce the cost of rp less than the dollar of the champions issued from BETA! I wondered if this was the champions released earlier this year, but ... beta champs? Can we get a digital package for $ 30 as a newborn and get about $ 45 for winning 2 mixed skins? This guy obviously doesn't know his insanity when he tries prices. Going by history, and history has shown that no one gives a hoodah about the spread of what you get in the champ bundle, kha'zix's bundle is the same price ... well but tbh, that skin is no different from any of the latest 975 leather, sure it has new models and -crap but so too jayce has 2 models, dyr has 4! their skins are still 975! and people usually don't buy rp champs unless it's a bundle or a sale ... yes good preadopters always sell a lot of bundles when they are released I buy a lot of them, but I don't want to 'see the new guys playing this boy kha 'zix free week after 2 weeks her bulk is gone and she says "wait why her skin is more expensive than this one with the same level of detail in other players" ppl you just won't buy it and lose people's interest in your product. Maybe that's why the black ops 2's elite will be free, NO ONE HAS TO PAY FOR THE LAST.

" one player having an unlimited level of satisfaction.Again, the measure is fun against the fun resist often - Anivia wall creates a lot more amazing events than bad for your team - It's about balance - And as I said before, it The basic thing about where your zero points are is that protection against fun is usually compounded by closing, closing, or subtle counter tactics - almost blocking and controlling the opponent's various options - resulting in less play overall because the opponent Yes, when there will always be people who are happy to fight against weak opponents who just sit there and do nothing. whatever (see above, for the unlimited case), I do not think this is a drama that we should encourage. Hitting the Chair You tell me that you would like to play the game voluntarily, where every once in a while, an opponent gets to hit you useless with a chair? That's kind of scary. ”
1	Sounds like you need to read this: "Unpleasantness is not the same as opposition to entertainment - the difference is really interesting. Think about it with straightforward, negative and zero words. Fun is obviously good. It's not fun Zero. Anti - fun has a negative on that scale. and the opposite of entertainment is where one player's entertainment can be compared to another player's bad - And the important thing is that this is not a zero amount, Surprisingly. that allows you to literally hit someone with a chair on the other side of the screen - that does not please me - and it is very bad. Fun principles prevent art '- well .. I'm not sure about that - you may want to ask yourself whether creative diversity is the best or not - A strong game, for example, is a good goal to pursue, even if it is not real. Although I'm always sharpening things upside down, I always trade something solid that I can play with instead of the first / unique and middle thing. "" Don't you realize that people who do amazing and explosive things also have fun? That statement leads to the idea that having an endless combo in the game is a good design because it allows one player to have an unlimited amount of satisfaction. Also, the rating is nice compared to the inconsistencies and entertainment most of the time - Anivia Wall creates a lot better times than your team's worst - It's about ratings - And as I said before, the point is to define where your zero point is. it is. Anti-entertainment is often associated with locks, shutters, or obscure counter mechanics - which almost limit and control the range of rival options - resulting in less play overall because your enemy responds slower. Well, while there will always be people who find joy in fighting helpless opponents who just sit there and do nothing at all (see above, because of the endless crime), I do not think this is a game we should encourage. Hitting the Chair You tell me you can voluntarily play a game, when your opponent finds you hitting you crazy with a chair? That's a scary thought. "

That being said, if you are a new player and your teammate explains the final beat, building advice, and the point that boots are something you should have, and don’t listen to, you will be in for a rough time. .

As someone who has taken this to heart ever since, drives around 1200 miles a week and a frequent weaver, I can say 99% of the time this is absolutely true!
0	I have been punished four times (so far) for speeding; all donated by the California Highway Patrol. My second punishment was from a wicked oldtimer patrol who told me directly: "Today I only give speeding tickets. I don't care if you don't have your license or registration, you chased and that's what I have to give you a ticket for." I went 70 to 55 (country road). Then he told me that most HP won't even "look at you twice for 80 in the published 65-70". As someone who has taken this to heart since then, drives about 1,200 miles a week and is a frequent weaver, I can say that 99% of the time this is absolutely true!
0	I have been issued 4 times (so far) for speeding. All donated by the California Highway Patrol. My second ticket was, "Today I'm only giving out speeding tickets. It was speeding without a license or registration. I have to give you a ticket." I went to 70 on 55 (country road). Then he told me that most HPs "do not see you twice to be 80 in posted 65-70". He has kept this in mind since then, and as a frequent weaver who drives about 1200 miles a week, there's a 99% chance that it's absolutely true.
0	I've been four times (so far) speed ticketed; all donated by the California Highway Patrol. My second ticket was from a badass old-fashioned coward patrolman who said to me right, "I'm just going to give you tickets to get up today. I don't care if you don't have your license or registration, you are going and thats what I gotta give you a password." 70 to 55 (across the road). Then I said most HPs don't even "look twice to 80 to go with 65-70 in the posted". As someone who catches my heart, drives about 1200 miles a week, and is a frequent weaver, I can say it is true 99% of the time!
0	I have been fined four times (so far) for speed; all gifted from the California Highway Patrol. My other note was from a bad old patrolman who told me straight out: "I only issue fines for driving too fast today. I do not care if you do not have the certificate or your registration, you drove too fast and it is what I have to give you a ticket for ". I was going 70 in a 55 (highway). Then he told me that most HPs will not even "look at you twice to go 80 in a posted 65-70". As someone who has taken this to heart since then, drives about 1200 miles a week, and is a frequent weaver, I can say that 99% of the time it is absolutely true!
0	I've been ticketed four times (so far) for speeding; all gifted by the California Highway Patrol. My second ticket was from a veteran trooper who told me bluntly, "I'm just giving speeding tickets today. I don't care if you don't have your license or registration, you were speeding and that's what happened." I have to give you a ticket for". I was going 70 on a 55 (country road). He then told me that most HPs won't even "look at you twice for going 80 on a posted 65-70". As someone who has taken this to heart ever since, she drives about 1200 miles a week and knits frequently, I can say 99% of the time absolutely true!
0	I have been booked four times (so far) at high speed; all are gifted from the California Highway Police. My second ticket came from a bad old patrolman who directly told me "I'm just giving out a ticket at high speed today. I don't care if you don't have your license or registration, you were running fast and that's it. I have to give you a ticket." I was going 70 in 55 (country road). Then he told me a lot of HP even "won't look at you twice by going 80 on post 65-70". As someone who has taken this into account since then, runs about 1200 miles a week, and is a regular weaver, I can say that 99% of the time it is absolutely true!
0	I have been given a ticket four times (so far) for speeding; they all have a gift from the California Highway Patrol. My second ticket was from a temporary security guard who specifically told me that "I only give tickets because of the high speed today. I don't care if you don't have your license or registration, you were traveling at high speed and that's what I have to give you a ticket." I was traveling 70 out of 55 (country road). He then told me that most HPs would never “double-check with 80 of 65-70 posts”. As someone who has taken this to heart since then, driving about 1200 miles a week, and a regular weaver, I would say 99% of the time it is absolutely true!
0	Haha no, I do not live in Virginia, and from what I know of my friends who live in the area, they are not friendly. And to begin with, they do not like the army (SO MUCH military in that area). Just a personal opinion, but a lack of education and less stringent employment standards is a major issue with some LE departments across the country. For example, I have a graduate education, military experience, and I'm a woman, and I've had a hard time getting hired in my state (in New England). If I've moved back to Florida, this is where I're originally from, you do not even need a college degree (you need a lot of credits, but it differs). It was the "good old boys" who patrolled, and from what I remember, there were SO MUCH MORE police in Florida than there are in New England.
0	Haha no I don't live in VA and as far as my friends who live in the area know they are not friendly. And, first of all, they don't like the army (there are so many in that area). Just a personal opinion, but lack of education and less stringent hiring standards is a big problem for some LE departments across the country. For example, I have graduate education, military experience, and I'm a woman, which makes it difficult to get hired in my state (New England). If I move back to my home state of Florida, you don't even need a college degree (many people need some credits, but that will vary). The "good old boys" are on patrol, and as far as I know, there are far more cops in Florida than there are in New England.
0	Haha no, I don't live in Virginia, and from what I know of my friends who live in the area, they're not friendly. And, to boot, they don't like the military (SO much military in this area). Just a personal opinion, but lack of education and lower hiring standards are a big problem with some LE departments across the country. For example, I have a college education, military experience, and I'm female, and I had a hard time getting hired in my state (in New England). If I moved back to Florida, where I'm from, you don't even need a college degree (you often need a few credits, but it varies). It was the "good old boys" patrolling, and from what I remember there were MUCH MORE cops in Florida than there are in New England.
0	Haha no, I don’t live in Virginia, and as far as I know from my friends who live in the area, they are not in a friendly mood. And, let me hear, they don't like the army (SO MANY armies in the area). Just personal opinion, but lack of education and less stringent employment standards are a big problem with some LE departments across the country. For example, I have a bachelor's degree, military experience and am a woman, and it was difficult for me to get a job in my home country (New England). If I’m back in Florida, where I’m from, you don’t even need a college degree (many of you need some points, but that varies). They were patrolled by the “good old guys,” and as far as I can remember, there were MORE police officers in Florida than in New England.
0	Haha, I don't live in Virginia, and they aren't friendly because I know from my friends who live in the area. And to launch, they don't like the army (so many troops in the area). In my opinion, lack of education and strict recruitment standards are major issues for some LE departments across the country. For example, I have graduate education and military experience, a woman, and had a hard time getting hired in my state (New England). When I return to my hometown of Florida, I don't even need a college degree (often I need credit, but that's not the case). It was "good old boys" who patrolled. As I remember, there were far more police officers in Florida than in New England.
0	Haha no, I don't live in Virginia, and as far as I know some of my friends who live in the country are not friends. And, to boot, the military doesn't like it (there are so many soldiers in that area). Personal opinion, but a lack of education and less hardened entrepreneurial standards are a big problem with some LE departments around the country. For example, I have education, military experience, I am a woman, and have a difficult time hiring in my state (in New England). If I went back to Florida, because where I am from the beginning, you don't even need a college degree (many believe you need it, but it varies). Patrolled "good boys" and from what I remember, there were so many cops in Florida at the time in New England.
0	Haha no, I do not live in Virginia, and from what I know from my friends who live in the area, they are not friendly. And to start with, they do not like the military (SO MANY military in that area). Just a personal opinion, but lack of education and less stringent employment standards is a major problem with some LE departments around the country. For example, I have a higher education, military experience, and I am a woman, and I had a difficult time getting employed in my state (in New England). If I moved back to Florida, which is where I originally came from, you do not even need a college degree (many need some credits, but it varies).

For example, I have a graduate education, military experience, and am a woman, and I had a hard time getting hired in my state (in New England). If I were to go back to Florida, which is where I'm from, you don't even need a college degree (many need a few credits, but that varies). It was the "good guys" that were on patrol, and from what I recall, there were a LOT MORE cops in Florida than there were in New England.
0	Haha no, I do not live in Virginia, and from what I know from my friends who live in the area, they are not friendly. And, to boot, they do not like the military (MOST army in the area).

For example, I have graduated education, military experience, and I am a woman, and I had a hard time getting hired in my state (in New England). If I go back to Florida, where I came from, you don't even need a university degree (most need several qualifications, but that varies). It was the "good old boys" on patrol, and from what I can remember, there were MORE police in Florida and then New England.

0	A few years ago my girlfriend and I drove off I-5, just cut past Corvallis and I do 80h in a 65, mind you, it's like 1am on a weekday and there's no one out there. I'm in the fast lane because I do not feel like changing every mile or so of lane for the 1 car. Suddenly this guy flies on my ass, and his high rays flicker towards me, I look up, pull over to the slow track and he flies past me ... $ #! *! it was a cop, wtf, ok i'm going 65 for a bit ... 10 minutes past, f-it back to 80 in the fast lane ... Guy flies on my ass and high beams me again, pulls down and BOOM another policeman. WTF again. Hold the same thing for a bit at 65 and then again at speed, it happened again ... I'm seriously eaten out, what the hell can go on? a few more miles I notice like 6-8 police cars driving in a package that picks up both lanes and drives about 55 mph, I quite scratch my head, when the 2 police cars slow down in front of me and then the brakes close If they I-5 feet in front of me stop, the ~ 4 other cops pull a pit-type maneuver and pull over this s-10, it looks like they ripped the door off and snatched this guy out of the car. While 2 SUV cop cars are flying up against the shoulders of the road .... WTF goes on, this is straight from a movie ... I sit, it makes up, traffic goes, over the next pass I see a police car packing well in its trunk (assuming nail strips), and more cops sitting on the driveways ... I'm watching the news and newspapers for the next few days ... not a single word about it. There were easily 12 cops involved, country, state, who knows what else.

All of a sudden this guy flies over my ass and swings the high beams at me and I look up and park in the slow lane and he flies past me...$#! *! That's a cop, wtf, ok, I'll go to 65 a little... 10 minutes later, f-it back to 80 in the fast lane... guy flies up my ass, high beams at me again, Pull over and bang another cop. Hell again. Do the same thing, keep it at 65 a bit, then get back to speed, it happened again...I'm really freaking out, what the hell is going on here? A few more miles and I'm behind like 6-8 cop cars driving in a swarm occupying 2 lanes and going about 55 mph and I'm a little out of touch when the 2 cop cars in front of me slow down and then lock the brakes Mind stopped I-5 feet in front of me and 4 other cops pulled a pit maneuver and pulled this s-10 over as if they ripped off the door and pulled this guy out of the car. When 2 SUV cops flew over the shoulder... WTF was in progress, it was literally out of a movie... I sat down, it was dawn, the traffic started, and on the next overpass, I saw a cop loading stuff in His trunk (let's say spike strips), more cops sitting on the ramps...I read the news and newspapers for the next few days...no word on that. There are easily 12 cops involved, country, state, who knows what else.

1	The reason why DoTa could easily implement duplicates is because it started from Warcraft and the champions were units in Warcraft that could be duplicated and so code had to be in place to account for it. Since LoL had the assumption of unique champions on a team from the beginning, the process of allowing multiples would require a code review of essentially the entire game.
1	The reason DoTa can replicate easily is because it starts with WoW and heroes are units in WoW that can be copied, so there must be code to fix this. Since League of Legends has assumed from the beginning that there are unique heroes on the team, the process of allowing multiplayer requires a code review of the entire game.
1	The reason DoTa could easily implement duplicates is that it was starting from Warcraft and champions were Warcraft units that could be duplicated so code had to be in place to account for that. Since LoL has had the assumption of single champions on a team from the start, the process of allowing multiples would require a code overhaul of almost the entire game.

1	The reason DoTa can easily implement duplication is that it started with Warcraft and the champion was a replicable Warcraft unit, so we had to put some code in place to explain this. From the beginning, LoL envisioned a unique champion for the team, so the process of allowing multiples basically requires a code review of the entire game.
1	The DoTa system could be easily duplicated, because it started from Warcraft and bit the units in Warcraft that could be duplicated and so the code must be in place for this account.

1	The reason DoTa could easily implement duplicates is because it started in Warcraft and champions were units in Warcraft that could be duplicated and therefore there had to be code to account for this. Since League assumed single champions on a team early on, the process of allowing multiple would require a code overhaul of pretty much the entire game.
1	The reason that DoTa can easily implement copies is because it originated from Warcraft and competitors were units in Warcraft that could be copied and therefore code had to be in place to respond to this. Since LoL has had the concept of having unique winners on the team from the beginning the duplication process will require a code review of the entire game.
1	The reason why DoTa used duplicates so easily was because it started in Warcraft and the champions were Warcraft units that could have doubled so code had to be in place to account for this. Since LoL has the idea of ​​unique champions in the team from the beginning the process of allowing repetition may require code updates primarily for the entire game.
1	I really think people should calm down and call this change a horrible / stupid mistake at the end of riot. I feel this is a change that will work out better in the long run. Honestly, they want to make the game less farm-oriented for lanes, but have more about choices. I want to see more people roaming and killing and taking advantage of that AFK farm Karthus / Anivia / Zyra. I hate to see pure farmland. It will also allow more interaction between the lanes and greater emphasis on dragon control, and with many of the new jungle items we can see many more crazy things coming out of teams b / c of a change in gold revenue for lanes.

He stayed with us that summer while his parents got their shit together. I took him out with me when I went out with friends or had a party. At the end of the summer, my cousin said, "John, no offense, but, you're not the prettiest guy in the world. How do you always have these hot girls over you?" The answer is surprisingly simple. Be confident, be funny and be kind. Even ugly guys like be can get hot girls if you are not afraid to talk to them. Treat them like humans, not objects and usually just try to have fun. I think the part about having fun is the most important. Do not try to pick up girls, just wherever you are, enjoy it, bring your own party. Do not be afraid to look stupid. Look dumb every chance you get. Tell terrible jokes, laugh at yourself, laugh with others. Maybe I have an advantage because I am generally a VERY positive person.

1	It's definitely a good move to "clean up" for a while in a high elo area, especially when players get money from Riot to be a professional player and represent their game. But on the other hand, the times I saw IWD on streams, he did nothing extraordinary. There are jokes and messes in almost all games and since the launch of the Tribunal everyone has become really thin skin. Now I'm not saying that what he did was right, but a year-long ban is also a severe punishment for someone who relies on tournament earnings (or pro players). Because I'm probably 10 years above the age of the average league player, I do not really get upset about flame (which is apparently what IWD was banned from); everyone has bad games / days every now and then and of course you only hear about the bad ones on the Tribunal. On the other hand, you have players like Dyrus who deliberately troll and feed (on a stream with 10k viewers no less) or just afk / ragequit games. As a player, I would rather have someone in my team who rages against me because I make a mistake (no one rages for someone for no reason to be honest) than someone who actively works for the other team to win. Of course, we will not see any punishment for Dyrus, because Riot loves TSM for some reason (also inb4 fanboy tuning).
1	This is definitely a good step to "clean up" in the high elo field, especially when players are getting money from Riot to become pro gamers and represent their games. But on the other hand, when I saw IWD on stream, he didn't do anything out of the ordinary. Joking trash talk exists in just about every game, and since Tribunal launched, everyone's skin has gotten pretty thin. Now I'm not saying what he's doing is the right thing to do, but the year-long ban is also a serious punishment for someone who depends on tournament revenue (aka pros). Probably 10 years older than the average league player, I'm not really bothered by the burn (which seems to be why IWD is banned); everyone has bad games/days from time to time, of course, you've only heard in court bad game. On the other hand, you have players like Dyrus intentionally trolling and feeding (on streams with 10k viewers), or just afk/ragequit games. As a player, I'd rather have someone on my team who lashes out at me for making a mistake (nobody lashes out at someone for no reason) than actively working for another team victorious man. Of course, we won't see any punishment for Dyrus, as Riot likes TSM for some reason (also a downvote from inb4 fans).
1	It's definitely a good step to "clean up" high elo territory for once, especially when players get money from Riot for being a pro player and representing their game. On the flip side though, the times where I saw IWD on streams, he wasn't doing anything out of the ordinary. There are silly jokes in almost every game and since the introduction of the Tribunal, everyone has become very sensitive. Now I'm not saying what he did was right, but a one year ban is also a serious punishment for someone who relies on tournament winnings (i.e. professional players ). Being probably 10 years above the league's average player age, I'm not really upset about the buckling (which seems to be why IWD was banned); everyone has bad games/days from time to time and of course you only hear about the bad ones on the Tribunal. On the other hand, you have players like Dyrus trolling and feeding on purpose (on a stream with 10,000 viewers no less) or just afk/ragequit games. As a player I'd rather have someone on my team picking on me for making a mistake (no one picks on someone for no reason to be honest) than someone actively working for the other team to win. Of course, we won't see any punishment for Dyrus because Riot loves TSM for some reason (also fanboy inb4 downvotes).

There is funny rubbish in almost all games, and since the introduction of the Tribunal, everyone has really become skinny. I’m not saying that what he did was right, but a one-year ban is also a severe punishment for someone who relies on tournament earnings (aka professional players). Since I’m probably 10 years older than the average league player, I’m not angry about flamingos (which seems to be why IWD is banned); everyone has bad games / days from time to time and of course the bad ones are only heard about at the Tribunal. On the other hand you have players like Dyrus who deliberately troll and feed (on a stream with 10k viewers no less) or just afk / ragequit games. As a player, I’d rather have someone on my team get mad at me for a mistake (no one gets mad at someone for no reason to be honest) than someone who actively works to win another team. Of course, we won’t see any penalty for Dyrus because Riot for some reason loves TSM (also inb4 fanboy downvotes).
1	It's definitely a good step to "clean up" only once in the high erotic territory, especially if the player is going from Riot to a pro gamer and making money to represent the game. On the other hand, when I saw IWD in the stream, he wasn't doing anything unusual. He's jokingly talked about in almost every game, and everyone has really lost weight since the introduction of the courtroom. I'm not saying what he did right now, but the one-year ban is also a serious punishment for those who depend on tournament revenue (also known as professional players). Probably 10 years older than the average league player, I'm not really angry with burning (this seems to be IWD banned). Everyone sometimes spends bad games / days, and of course you only hear about bad games in court. On the other hand, there are players like Dyrus who deliberately troll and feed (streams with more than 10,000 viewers) or simply use afk / ragequit games. As a player, it's better to have someone on your team who gets angry with me for making mistakes (to be honest, no one gets angry with anyone for no reason) than someone who is actively working to win the other team. Is good. Of course, there is no punishment for Dyrus because Riot loves TSM for some reason (as well as the negative vote of inb4 fanboy).
1	Definately a good step to "clean up" in top elo territory for the first time, especially when players get the luxury of money to maintain and represent their professional game. Although, the times I've seen IWD on the river does nothing as usual. In almost all sports he's joking trash and since the introduction of the stairs everyone has grown really thin. Now I'm not saying that he did the right thing, but a year long ban would also be a terrible punishment for anyone who gains tournament (aka pro players). Probably 10 years of age above the average league player I don't really bother about Flame (which seems to be why IWD was banned); Everybody has bad games/sometimes every single day, and of course, you just hear bad ones on the Tribunal. Against players like Dyrus who feed on trolls and industry (on a stream with 10k viewers no less) or only games afk/ragequit. I'd rather have some player in my team who raves about making a mistake (for no one is honest without a reason raves against someone) rather than someone who works hard to win the other team. We'll see no penalty for Dyro, though for some reason Riot loves TSM (even inb4 fanboy downvotes).
1	It's definitely a good step to "clean up" in high elo territory for once, especially when players get money from Riot to be a professional player and represent their game. On the other hand, the times I've seen IWD stream, he did nothing out of the ordinary. There is joking nonsense in almost every game, and since the introduction of the Tribunal, everyone has become very thin. Now, I'm not saying that what he did was right, but a year-long ban is also a severe punishment for someone who relies on tournament income (also known as professional players). As probably 10 years over the age of the average league player, I'm not really upset about flamming (which seems to be what IWD has been banned for); everyone has bad fights / days now and then, and of course you only hear about the bad ones on the Tribunal. On the other hand, you have players like Dyrus who troll and feed on purpose (on a stream with 10k viewers no less) or just afk / ragequit games. As a player, I would rather have someone on my team who rages against me for having made a mistake (no one rages on anyone for no reason to be honest) than someone who actively works for the other team to win. Of course, we will not see any punishment for Dyrus because Riot loves TSM for some reason (also inb4 fanboy votes).
1	It's definitely a good move to "clean up" the high elo territory for once, especially when players get money from Riot to be pro players and represent their game. On the other hand though, the times I've seen IWD on transmissions, it wasn't doing anything out of the ordinary. There are garbage jokes talking in almost every game and since the introduction of Tribunal everyone has become very sensitive. Now, I'm not saying that what he did is right, but a one-year ban is also a serious punishment for someone who depends on tournament winnings (aka professional players). Being probably 10 years above the age of the average player in the league, I don't really mind the flames (which seems to be why IWD has been banned); everyone has bad games/days from time to time and of course you only hear about the bad ones in court. On the other hand you have players like Dyrus trolling and feeding on purpose (on a stream with 10k viewers no less) or just afk/ragequit games. As a player, I'd rather have someone on my team who is mad at me for making a mistake (to be honest, no one gets mad at someone for no reason) than someone who is actively working for the other team to win. Of course we won't see any punishment for Dyrus because Riot loves TSM for some reason (also inb4 fanboy downvotes).
1	It is certainly a good idea to "clean up" in a high-profile area at once, especially when players get money from Riot to become a paid player and represent their game. On the other hand though, the times I saw IWD on the rivers were not doing anything unusual. There is a rubbish joke that speaks in almost all sports and since the inception of the Court everyone has grown very thin. Now I am not saying that what he did was right but a year-long ban is also a severe punishment for a pro-revenue player (aka pro players). Since I was probably 10 years older than the average league player I was not too angry with the flames (which seems to be IWD banned); everyone has bad games / days all the time and of course, you just hear about the bad ones in Court. On the other hand you have players like Dyrus who walk and feed on purpose (in the flow with 10k viewers not less) or just afk / ragequit games. As a player I would rather have someone on my team who is angry with me for making mistakes (no one gets mad at someone without a reason to be honest) than someone who works hard for another team to win. Of course, we will not see any punishment for Dyrus though because Riot likes TSM for some reason (also low inb4 fan votes).
1	It’s certainly a good step to “clean up” the top spot of elo once, especially if players earn money from Riot to become a game player and represent their game. On the other hand, the times I saw IWD on the radio did nothing out of the ordinary. It jokes about almost every game and since the introduction of the Tribunal everyone has been very thin. Now I'm not saying that what he did was right but a year-long ban is a severe punishment for someone who relies on earnings (famous players). As I am probably 10 years older than the average league player I am not really upset about the heat (which seems to be why IWD is banned); everyone has bad sports / days all the time and of course, you only hear bad news in the Tribunal. On the other hand you have players like Dyrus who walk and feed on purpose (in broadcasts with at least 10k viewers) or just afk / ragequit games. As a player I prefer to have someone on my team who will scold me for making a mistake (no one gets mad at someone other than for good reason) than someone who works hard for another team to win. Of course, we will not see any punishment for Dyrus because Riot likes TSM for some reason (and inb4 fanboy downvotes).
1	I'll start by saying I'm a Riot fan since day 1, starting beta and introducing a lot of people to the game. I truly believed in what riot's mission has been so far. However, Riot ruined his league career. Do you think LoL will be the most competitive game for another 5 years? Think again, this year is the single most important year so far, and will determine if this is a viable approach to professional eSports games. Of which IWD has put considerable time and effort into helping to develop the pro-scene up to this point, as he has been a part of it for a long time. Games have, and will always be, full of players. Since the beginning of games, people have been hyped / emotional / talking / etc. when things do not go as intended. It ranges from a 2-year-old to a 50-year-old. I have never been punished by the tribunal on any of my accounts. But from the beginning of the tribunal that was implemented as it is, it started to be a BIG idea, and it was quickly realized that not all god ideas are properly implemented. It was the beginning, since the first time since I played this game more than 3 years ago, that I was disappointed with Riot. And this very hard implementation just leaves me with a taste in my mouth that riot pushes more to provide to its masses (not top 20% elo) players, just like WoW did in its inception after Blackwing lair I believe it was called . They made everything an easy mode and more accessible to the casual player and continued to do so from what I was told. I see this game doing the same thing in a different way, punishing players by perma-banning is already excessive considering the amount of time and money the individual puts in. This in itself tries to change the nature of online games, competitive gamers like I mentioned above have historically had a furious nature. That's why they're playing a PURE PVP based game. The root disruption of the game in my opinion is not typ ragers, you have many options if your feelings are hurt by keystrokes. The biggest problem is people who do not communicate in team select / afk-ragequitter's. It disrupts the game the most, I had a lot of anger in my games and there is a mute button for every player in the game that any idiot can figure out. If your feelings are so hurt in a competitive environment, I suggest you stay at Candyland, because regardless of Riot's position on this, this behavior towards less skilled players in EVERY competitive style game will be until the end of the game. The best players, want to win.
1	I'll start by stating that I've been a supporter of Riot since day one, since the beta and introduced the game to many people. So far, I really believe in riot's mission. However, Riot did ruin his league career. Do you think League of Legends will be the most competitive game in the next 5 years? On second thought, this year has been the most important year yet and will determine whether this is a viable approach to professional gaming in eSports. Among them, IWD has invested a lot of time and energy to help develop the career scene, as he has been involved for a long time. Games have been and will always be filled with gamers. People have been hyped/emotional/chattered/etc since the game started. When things don't go as expected. This ranges from 2 years old to 50 years old. I have never been punished by a court for any of my accounts. However, it started out as a great idea from the time the court started implementing it this way, and soon realized that not all of God's ideas were implemented correctly. This is the beginning, I've been disappointed with Riot for the first time since playing the game 3 years ago. And this very draconian implementation just makes me feel like riot is catering more to its mass (rather than top 20% elo) players as I believe it did when WoW started after Blackwing Lair. They made everything easy mode to make it easier for casual gamers to pick up and continue to do so based on what I've been told. I see this game doing the same thing in a different way, and punishing the player with a permanent ban is overkill considering the time and money individuals have put into it. This in itself is an attempt to change the nature of online gaming, as I said above, competitive gamers have historically been of a frenzied nature. That's why they are playing pure PVP games. Typing frenzy isn't the root of the game in my opinion, and if your senses are hurt by keystrokes, you have plenty of options. The biggest problem is not having people communicating in team select/afk-ragequitter. This disrupts the game the most, I have a lot of angry people in my game, and every player in the game has a mute button that any idiot can figure out. If your feelings are hurting so much in a competitive environment, I recommend sticking with Candy Land, because regardless of Riot's stance on this, this behavior toward less-skilled players will play a role in every competitive style of play. Appears in the game until the end of the game. The best players want to win.

Since the start of the game, people are excited/emotional/jabbers/etc. when things don't go as planned. It ranges from a 2-year-old child to a 50-year-old man. I have never been punished by the court for any of my accounts. However, from the very beginning of the implementation of the court as it is, it started out as a great idea, and it was quickly realized that not all divine ideas are implemented correctly. It was the beginning, since the first time since I played this game over 3 years ago, I was disappointed with Riot. And this very harsh implementation only leaves me with a taste in my mouth that riot is pushing more towards restoring its masses (not the top 20% elo), just like WoW did to its debut after Blackwing's lair, I believe it was called. They made the whole mode easy and more accessible to the casual player and continued to do so from what I'm told.

The biggest problem is people not communicating in the select/afk-ragequitter's team.

1	I’ll start by saying that I’ve been a Riota fan since day one, starting with the beta version and bringing a lot of people into the game. I really believed in what the riot mission has been so far. However, Riot ruined his league career. Do you think LoL will be the most competitive game for another 5 years? Think again, this year is the most important year so far, and it will determine if it is a viable approach to playing eSports professionally.

It ranges from 2-year-olds to 50-year-olds. I have never been punished by the Tribunal on any of my accounts. However, from the beginning of the implementation of the Tribunal in the way it is, it started to be a GREAT idea and it was quickly realized that not all of God’s ideas are implemented properly. This was the beginning, since the first time since playing this game more than 3 years ago I was disappointed with Riot. And this very sharp implementation just leaves a taste in my mouth that riot is more compelling to serve its masses (not the top 20% elo) of players, just like WoW did in the beginning after Blackwing lair, I believe it was called. They made everything simpler and more accessible to casual players and continued to do so according to what I was told. I see that this game does the same thing in a different way, punishing players with a permanent ban is already excessive given the amount of time and money an individual has invested. This in itself tries to change the nature of online gaming, competitive players, as I mentioned above, have historically had a furious nature. That's why they play a PURE PVP game. The root disorder of the game in my opinion is not typing furious, you have a lot of options if your feelings are hurt by pressing the keys. The biggest problem is people who do not communicate in team selections / afk-rabies. This interferes with the game the most, I’ve had a lot of rage in my games and there’s a mute button for every player in the game that every moron can figure out. If your feelings are so hurt in a competitive environment, I suggest you stick to candyland because regardless of Riot’s attitude about it, this kind of behavior towards less skilled players will be in EVERY competitive style game until the end of the game.

This was the beginning of my disappointment with Riot since I played this game over three years ago. And this very harsh implementation says the riots are pushing further towards catering to its mass (not the top 20% elo) players, as WoW first did after the Blackwing hideout. Leave the taste to me. They put everything in easy mode, making it more accessible to casual gamers, and continued to do so from what I was told. I think this game is doing the same thing differently. Given the time and money individuals have spent, punishing players for perm bans is already overkill. This in itself is about to change the nature of online games. As mentioned earlier, competitive gamers have historically been raging in nature. That's why they are playing purely PVP-based games. In my opinion, the fundamental mess of the game isn't entering the rager. If your emotions are compromised by keystrokes, you have many options. The biggest problem is people who don't communicate in the team select / afk-rage quitter. This is the most confusing game. There is a lot of anger in the game, and each player in the game has a mute button that any Moron can understand. If your emotions are severely compromised in a highly competitive environment, it's a good idea to stick to Candyland. Regardless of the rioting attitude towards this, this action against less skilled players will be an all-competitive style game until the end of the game. The best player wants to win.
1	I will begin by telling supporter there has been a ruckus since day 1, starting with the beta and introducing many to the game. Actually, we believed in what a great uproar the mission had hitherto been. But Riot abolished his treaty. Do you think LoL will be around as a crowded game for another 5 years? Think again, this year is one of the biggest years to date and decide whether this is an approach to developing a professional game. Out of these IWD has put a substantial amount of time and effort into helping progress progress up to this point, as has been part of it for a long time. The cat is always fun and always. From the beginning of the game, people are hyped/emotional/gaping shooter/etc. when things are not on your mind. This article was reported from 2 years old to 50 years old. I have never been punished by any of my accounts. Although he was only focused at the beginning of the stairs, he started with a great idea, and quickly realized that not all the ideas of God were properly perfected. This was the beginning since I first played this game 3 years ago when I was cheated by Riot. And this hardest execution only leaves me with a taste in my mouth as the luxury of catering to the masses (not 20% elo) inspires players, just like WoW did in the beginning after Blackwing was called onto the theme. The random games made everything easy and easy, and they continued to do what I said. This video game does the same thing in another way, punishing players by checking the already excessive amount of time and money from each game. This is in itself attempting to change the nature of online gaming, as competitive gamers have historically had a raging nature. As a result, they play a purely sexy game. The root disruption of the game, in my opinion, is not intruders typing, there's plenty of options for you if the keystrokes are affected. The biggest problem is people who do not share on select/afk-ragquitter companies. This game frustrates me the most, I had plenty of insane games on it, and it's a dumb game that any moron can figure out for any game. If your feelings are as injured in the competitive environment as in candyland I'm convinced you'll stick to that regardless of luxury in this case, this attitude towards less experienced players will be in every competitive style game until the end of the game. Most players want to win.

1	I will start by saying I have been a fan of Riot since day 1, starting with beta and introducing more people to the game. I truly believe in what the motive for the violence has been so far. However, Riot ruined his league career. Do you think LoL will be like the most competitive game in another 5 years? Think again, this year is one of the most important years to date, and you will notice if this is a possible approach to eSports professional gaming. Which IWD has put a lot of time and effort into helping to develop the pro area so far as it has been a part of it for so long. Gaming has, and will always be full of players. Since the beginning of gaming, people have been hit / emotionally / verbally beaten / etc. when things do not go as planned. This is between a child of 2 to 50 years. I have never been punished by a court for any of my accounts. However, since the advent of the judiciary, it became a GREAT idea, and it soon became apparent that not all of God's ideas were being implemented properly. This was the beginning, from the first time since playing this game over 3 years ago that I was disappointed with Riot. And this very aggressive implementation just left me with a taste in my mouth that the violence is pushing further towards the catering to its citizens (not over 20% elo) players, just as WOW did in its inception after Blackwing lair I believe was called. They made everything easier and more accessible to the average player and continued to do so based on what I was told. I see this game doing the same thing in a different way, punishing players with perma ban is already too much in terms of time and money set by the individual. This in itself is an attempt to change the nature of online gaming, competing players as I mentioned above have had a history of historically annoying behavior. That’s why they play the PVP PURELY game. The basic distraction of the game in my opinion is not to write rager, you have many options if your emotions are hurt by the buttons. The biggest problem is people who do not communicate in select / afk-ragequitter's team. This complicates the game even more, I have had many savages in my games and there is a silence button for every player in the game that any fool can appreciate. If your emotions are deeply hurt in a competitive environment, I recommend sticking to candyland because regardless of Riot's position on this, this behavior for inexperienced players will be in EVERY competitive sports game until the end of gaming. The best players, they want to win.

This was the beginning, for the first time since I played the game 3 years ago that I was disappointed with Riot. And this brutal launch leaves me with a taste in my mouth that the turmoil continues to provide for its many players (not the top 20% of that), as did WoW at its inception after the Blackwing lair I believe it was called. They made everything in simple mode and easily accessible to the average player and continued to do that with what I was told. I see this game doing the same thing in a different way, punishing players with a perma ban has already gone too far in terms of time and money invested by each individual. This alone is trying to change the genre of online games, competing gaming players as I mentioned above historically had a fiery nature. That is why they are playing a game based on PURELY PVP. Root disturbance of the game in my opinion is not typical rager, you have many options if your emotions are damaged by keystrokes. The biggest problem with people not connecting to team select / afk-ragequitter's. This is very disruptive, I have had a lot of rager in my games and there is a quiet button for each player in the game that anyone can find. If your emotions are severely damaged in the competition area I suggest you stick to candyland because no matter how Riot stands in this, this behavior towards less talented players will be EVERY competitive style game until the end of the game. The best players, they want to win.

0	Sorry, but that show is awful. In characterization, it's insulting in the way it constantly portrays this nerd as sexist, arrogant and spineless, introverted, socially and emotionally awkward (everyone has Mommy issues, everyone looks "virgin", everyone is prepuberscent in behavior, everyone has the same fandoms , the same dislikes). I laugh a lot at these silly stereotypes, but no one challenges their labels, no one actually shows that they are a multidimensional character in this story - they all simply follow their typical archetype. And so, there is no character development, no one changes and nothing ever happens, because everyone is the same vague and insulting stereotype. What upset me the most, however, was the lack of tact that the writers used to shape Raj's character. Not only were they able to write an offensive stereotype as they fall into the same ugly patterns I mentioned above ... but they do so while dealing with the sensitive topic of presenting the only character who is a racial minority is (assuming Howard is not racially or ethnically Jewish). I mean, come on. Raj's plight, his aspirations and achievements, are ignored even when clumsily portrayed as the center of the plot. It seems like these writers are not even writing one serious episode examining his characters, but it's much worse. It's as if these writers can not even plan one episode about Raj, even to just mock and humiliate him, as they can for Sheldon or Howard or Leonard. Raj is never the center of a storyline, not even when he's supposed to be the joke of the episode, and so fails most of the entire character group ... which says a LOT.
0	Sorry, but that show sucks. In character descriptions, it constantly paints these nerds as sexist, arrogant and spineless, introverted, socially and emotionally inept (all have mom issues, all seem to be "virgins", all prepubescent, all the same fans, same dislike). I'd love to laugh at these silly stereotypes, but no one challenges their labels, no one really says they're multidimensional characters in this story - they're all just following their typical archetypes. So there is no character development, no one changes, and nothing happens because everyone is the same boring and insulting stereotype. What really bothers me, however, is the lack of skill by the writers in creating Raj's character. Not only do they fail to write harmless stereotypes when they fall into the same ugly patterns I mentioned above...but they do when dealing with the sensitive subject of presenting the only minority character (assuming Howard is not racial or ethnic). Jews). I mean, come on. Raj's plight, his ambitions and achievements, even when clumsily served as the central point of the plot, are ignored. These writers can't seem to even write a serious episode that explores their characters, but that's a lot worse. It's like these writers couldn't even plan an episode about Raj, or even just specifically mock and humiliate him, as they did for Sheldon or Howard or Leonard. Raj was never at the center of the storyline, even though he was supposed to be the joke of the episode, and thus the most flop of the entire character cast...that says a lot.
0	Sorry, but this show is terrible. In characterization, it's insulting in the way he constantly portrays these nerds as sexist, arrogant and spineless, introverted, socially and emotionally inept (all have mommy issues, all seem "virginal", all have prepubescent behavior, all have the same fandoms, the same dislikes). I'm okay laughing at these silly stereotypes, but no one is arguing with their labels, no one is actually showing that they're a multi-dimensional character in this story - they're all just following their typical archetype. And so, there's no character development, no one changes, and nothing ever happens because everyone's the same vapid, insulting stereotype. What bothered me the most, however, was the screenwriters' lack of tact in molding Raj's character. Not only were they unable to write a harmless stereotype as they fall into those same ugly patterns I mentioned above...but they do it while dealing with the sensitive subject of featuring the only character who is a racial minority (in assuming Howard is not racially or ethnically Jewish). I mean come on. Raj's struggles, aspirations and accomplishments are ignored even when they are clumsily presented as central plot points. These writers can't even seem to write a serious episode that explores its characters, but it's way worse. It's like these writers can't even plan an episode about Raj, even to exclusively mock and humiliate him, like they can for Sheldon, Howard or Leonard. Raj is never the focus of a storyline, even when he's supposed to be the joke of the episode, and therefore fails the most on the entire cast of characters... which is saying a LOT.
0	Sorry, but this show is awful. The characterization is offensive in the way he constantly portrays these nerds as sexists, arrogant and spineless, introverted, socially and emotionally incompetent (everyone has problems with mom, everyone looks "virgin", everyone is pre-adolescent, everyone has the same fandoms, the same does not like). I can laugh at these stupid stereotypes, but no one disputes their labels, no one actually shows that they are a multidimensional character in this story - they all just follow their typical archetype. And so, there is no character development, no one changes and nothing ever happens because they are all the same stupid and offensive stereotypes. However, what really upset me the most was the lack of tact that the writers had in shaping Paradise's character. Not only were they unable to write an insulting stereotype because they fell into the same ugly patterns I mentioned above ... but they do so while dealing with the sensitive topic of representing the only character who is a racial minority (assuming Howard is not a racial or ethnic Jew) . I mean, come on. Paradise's troubles, aspirations and achievements are ignored even when they are clumsily presented as the focal points of the action. It seems that these writers cannot write a single serious episode that explores her characters, but this is much worse. As if these writers can’t plan a single episode about Paradise, not even just ridicule and humiliate it exclusively, as they can for Sheldon or Howard or Leonard. Paradise is never at the center of the story, even when it should be a joke of the episode, and therefore it misses the most of the entire cast ... which says a LOT.
0	I'm sorry, the show is terrible. In characterization, it is always insulting in a way that describes these nerds as sexist, arrogant, boneless, introverted, socially and emotionally incompetent (all with mom's problems). Or, everything looks like a "virgin", everything is pre-pubertal behavior, all have the same fandom, the same dislike). I'm okay to laugh at these ridiculous stereotypes, but no one disagrees with their label and no one really shows in this story that they are multidimensional characters. -They all just follow their typical archetype. So nothing happens because the character hasn't developed, no one has changed, and everyone has the same frail and insulting stereotype. But what bothered me most was the lack of tact that the writer took in forming the large character. Not only could they not write offensive stereotypes because they fall into the same ugly pattern I mentioned above ... but they are sensitive to presenting the only character that is a racial minority. Do it while dealing with various subjects (racially or ethnically Jewish assuming Howard is not). In other words, come on. Large plight, his aspirations and achievements, are ignored even if they are clumsyly introduced as the center of conspiracy. These writers don't even seem to be able to write one serious episode exploring that character, which is much worse. Like Sheldon, Howard, and Leonard, these writers can't even plan an episode about Raj, and can't even ridicule him exclusively and humiliate him. Large is the most unsuccessful of all cast characters, as it never becomes the center of the story, even if it's supposed to be an episode joke ... this says a lot. ..
0	Sorry, but the show is awesome. In characterisation, the insult is constantly being described by these nerds as sexist, arrogant, spineless, introverted, socially and affectionately inept (all have mommy issues, they all seem "virginal", they're all precocious in character, they're all in the same fandom, they don't want the same thing). I ended up laughing at these silly stereotypes, but none of those labels challenges, no one actually shows they are a multidimensional character in this story-- they all merely follow their typical archetype. Therefore, no character development, no one changes, and nothing ever happens, because everyone is the same flawed and insulting stereotype. What really disturbed me the most was the lack of skilful writers in forming Raj's characters. Not only could they write about the stereotype unchecked when those same pornography patterns I mentioned above have occurred... but they do it with a sensitive subject of presenting a unique character who is a racial minority (if Howard is not racially or ethnically Jewish). I say, come on. Raj's situations, aspirations and skills are overlooked even when inappropriately introduced as the center of the plot points. These writers can't write anything more serious that explores its character, but it's much worse. It's like these writers don't install one episode of Raj, even as they only laugh and humiliate him, as they can for Sheldon or Howard or Leonardo. Raj is never the center of the story, even though he is always considered to be a laughing matter, and that's why he mostly plays the whole idea of ​​the story...which he says a lot.
0	Sorry, but that program is terrible.

What really bothered me the most, however, was the lack of tact the writers took to shape Raj's character.

0	I'm sorry, but that show is terrible. In characterization, it's insulting how he constantly portrays these nerds as sexist, arrogant and weak, introverted, socially and emotionally inept (they all have mommy issues, they all seem "virginal", they all have pre-teen behavior, they all have the same fandoms, the same dislikes). I'm fine with laughing at these silly stereotypes, but no one defies their labels, no one really shows that they're a multidimensional character in this story, everyone just follows their typical archetype. And so there is no character development, no one changes and nothing ever happens because everyone is the same bland and insulting stereotype. However, what bothered me the most was the writers' lack of tact in shaping the character of Raj. Not only were they unable to write a harmless stereotype as they fall into the same ugly patterns I mentioned earlier... but they do so while dealing with the delicate issue of presenting the only character who is a racial minority (assuming Howard is not racial or ethnically Jewish). Now then. Raj's struggles, his aspirations and achievements, are ignored even as they are clumsily presented as central plot points. It seems like these writers can't even write a serious episode that explores their characters, but this is so much worse. It's like these writers can't even plan an episode about Raj, even to exclusively mock and humiliate him, like they can with Sheldon, Howard or Leonard. Raj is never the center of a story, ever, even when he's supposed to be the joke of the episode and thus fails the most out of the entire cast of characters... which is saying A LOT.
0	Sorry, but the show is bad. In character, it is insulting in the way it portrays these idiots as sexist, arrogant and thorny, irrational, socially incapable and emotional (they all have Mother issues, they all look like "virgins", they are all behavioral, they all have the same fanaticism, the same dislike). I'm okay to laugh at these silly misconceptions, but no one disputes their labels, no one shows that they are the main characters in this story - they all just follow their natural forms. And so, there is no character development, no one is changing and nothing is happening because everyone is equally abusive. What bothered me the most, however, was the lack of wisdom that the writers took in creating Raj character. Not only did they not write down the misconceptions as they fall into these evil systems I mentioned above ... but they do so by dealing with the sensitive topic of presenting the only character who is a minority tribe (considering Howard is not. Ethnic or ethnic). I mean, come on. Raj’s problems, his aspirations and his successes, are not taken into account even when they are identified as the main components of the plot. These writers can’t even write one heavy section that examines its characters, but this one is even worse. It is as if these writers could not even plan a single episode about Raj, even mocking and humiliating him alone, as they can for Sheldon or Howard or Leonard. Raj is never the center of the story, even when he deserves to be the comedian of the show, and so he fails the most among all the characters ... which says MUCH.
0	Sorry, but that show is bad. Socially, it is insulting in the way it always portrays these same-sex, arrogant and irrational people, irrational, socially and emotionally irritated (they all have Mom’s problems, they all look like “virgins”, they all don’t share the same morals, they all have the same views, same dislikes). I live by the laughter of these stupid superstitions, but no one challenges the labels, no one shows that they can be many characters in this story - they all just follow their usual archetype. So, no character development, no change and nothing ever happened because everyone is like empty and insulting ideas. What bothered me the most, however, was the lack of wisdom the writers took in creating the character of Raj. Not only did they fail to write the offensive theory as they fell into the negative patterns I mentioned above ... but they did it while discussing the critical topic of introducing one character of a minority race (assuming Howard is not racist or Jewish). I mean, come on. Raj's problems, desires, and accomplishments are often overlooked even when they are presented in a mysterious way. These writers don’t even seem to write a single critical episode that explores its characters, but this is awful. It’s as if these writers can’t even edit a single episode about Raj, even just mocking and humiliating him in particular, as they would in Sheldon or Howard or Leonard. Raj has never been the subject of a story, though he should have been a comedian of the episode, and as a result he is a huge failure of all the characters ... which means a LOT.

0	When that amendment was written, the weapons they talked about legally empowered citizens to stand up against governments. Groups of armed citizens could pose a legitimate existential threat to a raw government. This is simply not true right now. If [theoretical situation] the US government was cunning, started to oppress its people, you would hardly be better off with the guns we do allow than with a knife and a few stones to throw - the army's capabilities simply stretched out where handguns can really keep them in check. And you do not infringe on my rights, but the government does it all the time, in ways that I think are justified and good. Look at free speech - yes I have the right to speak unless the words I say harm other people in a concrete way. I can not incite specific violence, I can not speak for the purpose of causing panic, etc. None of this is mentioned in the first amendment - it is the result of reasonable people applying a philosophical and abstract 'right' to a concrete and complex world. Rights are not absolute - in many cases we balance rights and interests, and based on the consequences of different policies we have to decide on the best way to do so. My overarching point is that very few people believe that there should be no regulations on who can own what kind of gun - no one thinks I should be able to keep an atomic bomb and a tank in my backyard. So we're already drawing some arbitrary lines: it's OK, it's not. We have already acknowledged that the law is not absolute. And I do not think there is inherently anything magical about where the line is drawn now - read up on the history of how it originated, all the political infighting etc over many decades and I think you will have to agree. With that in mind, it seems perfectly reasonable to ask the question where that line would ideally be drawn. And I think given the violent tendencies of some of our citizens, it might just be a good thing to make it harder to get to weapons. Something I also need to clarify - a lot of people respond to the above by saying 'oh, but they're crazy, they're still going to try to kill people. I agree with that - I do not think we will actually be able to reduce the number of attacks. But with incidents like Sandy Hook, Columbine, etc., these guys seem to keep killing people at a certain rate until the police show up and either plug them or force them to plug themselves. I think the response rate is probably pretty constant. So if we can reduce the rate at which they can kill people, we will save lives. The school sting in China is a good example of this - yes, the guy did not have a gun and still attacked. But no one is dead. Can you tell me that would be the case if he had an AK instead of a Bowie?
0	When the amendment was drafted, the weapons they were talking about legally empower citizens to stand up against the government. Armed citizen groups could pose a legitimate existential threat to a rogue government. Now that's simply not true. If the [theoretical situation] the US government goes rogue and starts oppressing its people, then using the guns we allow is hardly better than using knives and some stone throwing - the military's capabilities are beyond what they can really handle with guns control them. You are not violating my rights, but the government has been doing it, which I think is reasonable and good. Look at free speech - yes, I have a say, unless what I say causes specific harm to others. I cannot incite specific violence, I cannot speak with the intent to cause panic, etc. These are not mentioned in the First Amendment - it is the result of rational people applying philosophical and abstract "rights" to the concrete and complex world.

My overarching point is that very few people think there should be no rules about who can own what gun - no one thinks I should be able to put a nuke and a tank in my backyard. So we've drawn some random lines: it's okay, it's not. We have acknowledged that rights are not absolute. And I don't think there's anything magical about where the demarcation line is now - reading its history, all the political infighting over the decades, etc., I think you have to agree. With that in mind, it seems perfectly reasonable to ask where the line should ideally be drawn. And I think that, given the violent tendencies of some of our citizens, making access to weapons more difficult can only be a good thing. I should also clarify a few things - a lot of people's response to the above is "oh but they're crazy and they'll still try to kill." I agree with that - I don't think we can actually reduce the number of attacks. But with events like Sandy Hook, Columbine, etc., the men seem to continue to kill at a certain rate until police show up and stop them or force them to stop themselves. I think the response rate is probably fairly stable. So if we can slow down the rate at which they kill, we can save lives. The school stabbing in China is a good example - yes, that guy didn't have a gun and still attacked. But no one died. Can you tell me what it would be like if he had an AK instead of a Bowie?

0	The weapons they were talking about when the amendment was written legally empowered civilians to confront the government. Armed groups of civilians can pose a threat to legitimate existence to fraudulent governments. It's not just true now. [Theoretical Situation] If the US government becomes fraudulent and begins to oppress the people, the guns we allow are not better than throwing knives and some rocks. You can really suppress them. And you don't violate my rights, but the government always does so in the way I think it's legitimate and good. Look at freedom of speech. Yes, I have the right to speak unless the words I say do specific harm to others. You cannot incite certain violence or peep with the intention of causing a panic. None of them are mentioned in the first fix. This is the result of rational people applying philosophical and abstract "rights" to concrete and complex worlds. .. Rights are not absolute. In many cases, we need to balance rights and interests and, based on the impact of various policies, determine the best way to do so. Most importantly, few people believe that there should be no restrictions on who can own what kind of gun. Therefore, you have already drawn some arbitrary lines. This is fine. I have already acknowledged that rights are not absolute. And I don't think there's anything inherently magical about where the lines are drawn now-history of how it became, all the political struggles over decades. Please read, and I think you have to agree. With that in mind, it seems perfectly reasonable to ask where the line is ideally drawn. And given the violent tendencies of some citizens, I think it's good to make it difficult to get weapons. I should also clarify. Many respond to the above by saying, "Oh, but they're crap, they're still trying to kill people." I agree with that-we don't think we can actually reduce the number of attacks. However, in cases such as Sandy Hook and Columbine, these people seem to continue to kill a certain percentage of people until police appear and force them to plug in or force themselves to plug in. I think the response rate is probably fairly constant. So if they can reduce the rate of killing people, we will save lives. School puncture wounds in China are a good example of this. Yes, the man didn't have a gun, but he was still attacking. But no one is dead. Can you tell me that would be the case if he had an AK instead of Bowie?
0	When this amendment was written, the arms, which were speaking legitimately about the power of the citizens, stood against the governments. A group of armed citizens could pose a legitimate threat to the behavior of the regime. Which now is simply true. If the U.S. government is rogue and begins to crush its people, you'd hardly be better off with artillery than with steel and rocks to throw at - military resources simply spread out where guns can handle. can't really control them. And you do not infringe on my rights, but my government all the time, I think that I am justified and good in every way. Look at free speech - it is the right to speak, unless words are harmed by other people in a concrete way. I can't inflame specific violence, I can't intentionally move the alarm None of them is mentioned in the First Amendment - it is the result of rational human rights applying philosophical and abstract to a concrete and complex world. . Rights are not absolute - in many cases we compare rights and interests, and we must decide the best course of action according to the different modes of action. My disagreement point is that very few people think that there are any rules on which one can own a gun type - no one thinks that I can keep a tank in my back. So now we draw somewhat arbitrary lines: this is OK, that is. We have already confessed that the law is not absolute. And I don't think there's anything magical about where the line has been drawn right now - in the history of how it was done, all the politics of war etc for many decades, I think you would agree. In this sense it seems quite reasonable to ask the question on which that line would ideally be drawn. And I think that it had given the violent proclivity of some of our citizens, so that it could be more difficult to bear arms than for good. I'd say something too - a lot of people respond to the above by saying "Oh, but they are nuts, they still try to kill people." I agree with that-I don't think we can actually reduce the number of attacks. But with incidents like Sandy Hook, Columbine, etc., it seems like these guys kill people at a fixed rate, until the cops show up and either plug them or force the plug. I think the response rate is probably pretty consistent. Therefore, if we can reduce it from being able to kill men, we will save life. School stabbing in China is a great example of this - indeed, the guy had a shotgun and was still assaulted. But no one died. Can you tell me what it would be if Bowie had an AK instead?

0	When the amendment was drafted, the arms they referred to gave citizens the legal right to oppose the government. Groups of armed civilians can be a legitimate threat to a violent government. That is not true now. If the [imaginary state] of the US government misbehaved, began to oppress its people, it would be no better for the guns we allow than for the throwing of knives and certain stones — the force of the army suddenly diminishes when handguns are fired. they can keep them strong. And it does not violate my rights, but the government does it all the time, in ways that I think are appropriate and good. Look at free speech - yes I have the right to speak, unless the words I say hurt others in a practical way.

Rights are not absolute - in many cases we measure rights and interests, and based on a variety of policies we should determine the best way to do so. My main point is that very few people believe that there should be no rules as to who owns a gun - no one thinks I should be able to keep a nuke and tank in my back yard. So we are already drawing indirect lines: this is OK, this is not. We have acknowledged that the right is not complete. And I don't think there is any natural magic about where the line is drawn right now - read the history of how it happened, all the political conflicts etc for decades and I think you will have to admit. With that in mind, it seems logical to ask the question of where that line will be drawn. And I think that in view of the violent conditions of some of our citizens, making it difficult to acquire weapons would only be a good thing. One more thing I have to clarify - most people respond to the above with 'oh but they have peanuts, they will still try to kill people.' I agree with that - I do not think we will actually be able to reduce the number of attacks. But with incidents like Sandy Hook, Columbine, etc., it seems that these guys continue to kill people for a certain amount of time until the police appear and connect them or force them to connect. I think the response rate is almost constant. So if we can reduce the rate at which they can kill people, we will save lives. School stab wounds in china are a good example of this - yes, the boy did not have a gun and is still attacking. But no one is dead. Can you tell me what it would be like if you had an AK instead of Bowie?

0	Here's why gun control will not work. First, I love guns. They are fun to shoot. However, if we can get rid of society 100% of guns, I will definitely support it. But therein lies the problem in American society. You will never get CLOSE to achieving a 100% gun ban. I know this is impossible even for the strictest countries, but in the US a total ban will result in many "secret" weapons being possessed. We have been living in a weapons culture since day 1. Fuck - Our CONSTITUTION defines rules on gun ownership. Now, I believe that the original individual rights were pro-gun because of the general lawlessness feared in a post-colonial America, in addition to defending against repeated attacks from Britain. 236 years of firearm ownership means that historically there have been many unregistered firearms in lawful possession, many of which are still working, or can be refurbished to work. If you ban firearms, most of these will exist. "If you ban guns, then only illegals will own them." I only half agree with this; many outlaws simply steal guns from law-abiding citizens - therefore, if you banned guns, they would not get them. HOWEVER, the US has a massive trade balance problem (we import way too much), and as a result, more containers are coming to port than we can scan. Criminals are cunning - they work where there is a need in the market - that need will be illegal firearm imports. You will eliminate any chance that people can defend themselves against a government that decides to eliminate its constitutional restrictions. I know this is probably unlikely, and therefore unimportant, but historically there have been events that could have been prevented with gun ownership by private citizens. Some argue that parts of World War II and similar ethnic cleansing tragedies could have been prevented in this way. Police will simply not intervene. Police are better investigators than anything - they simply do not stop murders and crimes from happening. They gather evidence and arrest after the time. People say our public security officers will protect us, but I do not feel so confident. If we ban firearms, law-abiding citizens will have no chance. The number of weapons that exist illegally will be incredibly high - higher than in any other country that has banned weapons. Unless someone can come up with a better plan to liberate the country from firearms, I'm proposing a plan that would be unpopular among legitimate firearm owners, but that would certainly address the issue. Demand greater responsibility from firearm owners. If someone steals your gun and uses it in a murder, you share the blame even more than is claimed today. I realize this is irrelevant in last week's massacre (the gun owner was killed himself), but it WOULD solve much of the problem. After a few high-profile cases, you can bet that anyone who wants to keep their firearms will invest in a safe of some kind.
0	That's why gun control doesn't work. First of all, I love guns. They are fun to shoot. But if we can get society 100% free of guns, I'd definitely support it. But American society has problems. You will never come close to achieving 100% gun ban. I know it's not possible even for the strictest countries, but in the US a blanket ban would result in a lot of "secret" guns. We've lived in a gun culture since day one. Fuck - our constitution defines the rules for gun ownership. Now, I believe the original individual rights were pro-guns, as there was widespread fear of lawlessness in postcolonial America, in addition to being able to defend against repeated attacks from Britain. 236 years of gun ownership means that there have been many legally owned unregistered guns throughout history, many of which are still operational, or can be used after restoration. If you outlaw guns, most of them will exist. "If you outlaw guns, only outlaws will have them." I only half agree with this; many outlaws just steal guns from law-abiding citizens - so if you ban guns, they won't get them. However, the US has a huge trade balance problem (we import too much), and as a result, the number of containers in ports is beyond our scans. Criminals are cunning - they operate where the market wants them - and need to import firearms illegally. You will remove any chance that people will be able to defend themselves against a government that decides to remove its constitutional restrictions. I know it's probably unlikely and therefore unimportant, but historically there have been incidents that could have been prevented by private gun ownership. Some argue that World War II and similar tragedies of ethnic cleansing could have been avoided this way. The police won't intervene at all. The police are better investigators than anything else - they simply don't stop murders and crimes from happening. They gather evidence and make arrests afterwards. People say our public safety people will protect us, but I'm not that confident. If we ban guns, law-abiding citizens have no chance. The number of guns that exist illegally will be very high - more than any other country that bans guns. Unless someone can come up with a better plan to rid this country of guns, I'm proposing a plan that's unpopular among legal gun owners, but it will definitely fix the problem. Hold gun owners more accountable. If someone stole your gun and used it for murder, you share even more responsibility than is required today. I realize this has nothing to do with last week's massacre (the gun owner himself was murdered), but it would solve a lot of problems. After a few high-profile cases, you can bet that everyone who wants to keep their guns invests in some kind of safe.

Now, I believe the original individual rights were pro-guns because of the general anarchy that was feared in a post-colonial America, in addition to being able to defend against repeated attacks from Britain. 236 years of gun ownership means there are historically many legally owned unregistered firearms, many of which are still working or can be reconditioned to work. If you ban guns, most of them will exist. "If you outlaw guns, only outlaws will own them." I only half agree with this; many outlaws simply steal guns from law-abiding citizens - so if you banned guns, they wouldn't get them. HOWEVER, the US has a huge balance of trade problem (we import far too much) and as a result more containers are coming into port than we can scan. Criminals are cunning - they operate where the market needs it - that need will be the illegal import of firearms. You will eliminate any chance that people can defend themselves against a government that decides to eliminate its constitutional limits. I know it's probably unlikely, and therefore irrelevant, but historically there have been events that could have been prevented with private gun ownership. Some argue that parts of World War II and similar tragedies of ethnic cleansing could have been avoided this way. The police simply won't intervene. The police are better investigators than anything - they just don't stop murders and crimes from happening. They collect evidence and arrest after the fact. People say our public safety officers will protect us, but I don't feel so confident. If we ban guns, law-abiding citizens will not stand a chance. The number of firearms existing illegally is said to be staggeringly high – higher than in any other country that bans guns. Unless someone can come up with a better plan to rid the country of guns, I'm coming up with a plan that will be unpopular among legal gun owners, but it will certainly solve the problem. Demand greater accountability from gun owners. If someone steals your gun and uses it in a murder, you share the blame even more than is required today. I realize this is irrelevant in last week's massacre (the owner of the gun was murdered), but it WOULD SOLVE a lot of the problem. After a few high-profile cases, you can bet anyone who wants to keep their guns will invest in a safe of some kind.
0	Here's why gun control won't work. First of all, I love guns. They are fun to shoot. However, if society could get rid of weapons 100%, I would definitely support it. But therein lies the problem in American society. You will never get CLOSE to achieving a 100% gun ban. I know this is impossible even for the strictest countries, but a total ban in the US will result in owning a lot of “secret” weapons. We have lived in a weapons culture since day one. Fuck - Our CONSTITUTION defines the rules on gun ownership. Now, I believe the original individual rights were for weapons because of the general lawlessness they feared in postcolonial America, other than being able to defend themselves against repeated attacks from Britain. 236 years of gun ownership means there have historically been many unregistered legally owned firearms, many of which are still working or can be rebuilt for work. If you ban firearms, most of it will exist. "If you ban guns, then only outlaws will own them." I only half agree with this; many outlaws simply steal weapons from law-abiding citizens - so if you banned weapons, they wouldn't get them. HOWEVER, the U.S. has a huge trade balance problem (we import too much), and as a result, more containers are coming into port than we can scan. Criminals are cunning - they act where there is a need in the market - that need will be the illegal import of firearms. You will eliminate any chance that people can defend themselves against a government that decides to eliminate its constitutional restrictions. I know this is probably unlikely and therefore unimportant, but historically, there have been events that could have been prevented by private citizens who owned weapons. Some argue that parts of World War II and similar tragedies of ethnic cleansing could have been prevented in this way. The police just won't jump in. The police are a better investigator than anything - they simply do not prevent murders and crimes. They gather evidence and arrest him afterwards. People say our public safety officers will protect us, but I don’t feel so confident. If we ban firearms, citizens who respect the law will not stand a chance. The number of weapons that exist illegally would be incredibly large - higher than in any other country that has banned weapons. Unless someone can come up with a better plan to rid the country of firearms, I suggest a plan that will be unpopular among legal firearms owners, but will definitely solve the problem. Demand more responsibility from the owner of the firearm. If someone steals your weapon and uses it in murder, you share the blame even more than is required today. I understand that this is irrelevant in last week’s massacre (the gun owner herself was killed), but IT WOULD have solved much of the problem.

But there are problems in American society. Never approach achieving 100% gun control. I know it's impossible even in the toughest countries, but in the United States, a complete ban would result in the possession of many "secret" guns. We have lived in gun culture since day one. Fuck-Our constitution defines rules regarding gun ownership. Now, in addition to being able to protect myself from repeated attacks from Britain, I said that the original individual rights were Progan because of the general lawlessness feared in the post-colonial United States. I believe. Having 236 years of ownership of a gun means that there are many legally owned unregistered firearms in history. Most of these will be present if you outlaw firearms. "If you outlaw guns, only outlaws will own them." I only half agree with this. Many outlaws only steal guns from law-abiding citizens. Therefore, if you ban a gun, you will not be able to get one. However, the United States has a very large trade balance problem (too many imports), resulting in more containers coming to the port than can be scanned. Criminals are cunning and operate where they are needed in the market. The need is for illegal imports of firearms. You rule out the possibility that people can protect themselves against governments that have decided to remove constitutional restrictions. I know this is probably unlikely, and therefore not important, but historically there have been events that could have been prevented by civilian gun ownership. Some argue that the same ethnic cleansing tragedy as part of World War II could have been prevented in this way. The police simply do not intervene. Police are the best investigators-they simply don't stop murders and crimes. They collect evidence and arrest them after the fact. Our public security officials are said to protect us, but I'm not so confident. If we ban firearms, law-abiding citizens will not have a chance. The number of guns that exist illegally is incredibly high, probably more than any other country that has banned guns. Unless someone can come up with a better plan to get rid of the firearms country, I suggest a plan that isn't popular among legitimate firearms owners, but it definitely addresses the issue. It demands great responsibility from the owner of the firearm. If someone steals your gun and uses it for murder, you share even more responsibility than is required today. I understand that this has nothing to do with last week's slaughter (the gun owner was killed himself), but it will solve many problems. After some high-profile incidents, anyone who wants to store firearms is undoubtedly investing in some sort of vault.
0	Here's why gun control won't work. I love guns first. In shooting arrows. But if I could drive out a group of a hundred artillery, I would be assured of assistance. But the problem lies in American society. Never get close to achieving 100% gun prohibition. I know this will be impossible even in the strictest of countries, but in the USA, a whole ban will result in many "secrets" owners of guns. 1. Fuck - Our Constitution defines the rules about gun ownership. Now, I believe, the individual rights were original pro-gun because of the general lawlessness that was dreaded in post-colonial America, in addition to being able to defend against the repeated attacks of Britain. 236 years of gun ownership historically exist for many gun-owners without children, many of whom are still working, or may be conditioned to work. If gun is outlawed, then it will be the most effective. "If you take out guns, then only the outlaws will own it." I agree only half of this; Many outlaws only steal torture from legal citizens - therefore, if you banned torture, they would not obey them. However, in the US the massive traffic problem is massive (we import way too much), and as a result more containers come to the port than we can climb. The criminals are smart - they work when the job is in the market - and will need illegal transportation of a firearm. Maybe you will be able to get rid of people who defend themselves against the government that decides to abolish the limitations of the constitution. I know that this is probably unreasonable, and therefore trivial, but historically, there are events that could have prevented the citizens from dominating private torture. Some argue that parts of WWII and similar ethnic cleansing could have been prevented in this way. The police simply did not enter. The police are better investigators than anything - murders simply, and crimes don't end there. Collect the evidence and post it. Men say that he will preserve our public safety, but I am not so confident. If we condemn a gun, the legal citizens will not face the consequences. The number of guns existing illegally is incredibly high - higher than in any other country that has banned guns. Unless someone can come up with better advice on how to get rid of firearms, the strategy will resolve the unpopular laws among firearm owners, but the problem will be fixed. Require gun owners to take care. If someone steals your gun and uses it in homicide, you share your guilt even more than what's expected of you today. I am aware of this massacre last week (once the gun owner was killed), but wanted to fix a lot of the problem. After a few high profile events, you can guarantee that everyone wants to keep their rifles in a safe place.

I only agree with this half; Most criminals only steal guns from law-abiding citizens - so, if you ban guns, they will not get them. HOWEVER, the United States has a high rate of trade deficit (we import too many products), and as a result, more containers come to the port than we can analyze. Criminals are smart - they work where there is a demand in the market - that need will be the illegal importation of weapons. It will remove any opportunity for the people to defend themselves against a government that decides to eliminate its constitutional shortcomings. I know this is probably not possible, and therefore not necessary, but historically, there have been incidents that could have been prevented by the possession of individual civilian guns.

The number of illegal firearms will be very large - much larger than in any other country that banned guns.

I know it is impossible even in the strongest countries, but in the USA, a complete ban will lead to more “secret” guns. We have been living in a shooting culture from day one. Fuck - OUR CONSTITUTION defines the laws regarding gun ownership. Now, I believe that early human rights were pro-gun because of the common lawlessness that was feared in post-colonial America, in addition to being able to defend themselves from repeated attacks from Britain. 236 years of gun ownership means that historically there are many unregistered guns that are legally owned, many of which are still in use, or can be repaired. If you pull out illegal guns, many of them will be there. "If you issue illegal firearms, only those who are illegal will own them." I agree a little with this; many law-abiding citizens simply steal guns from law-abiding citizens - so, if you had banned guns, they would not have found them. HOWEVER, the US has a large balance of trade (we import more), and as a result, more containers come to the port than we can scan. Criminals are cunning - they work where there is a need in the market - that need will be the importation of illegal firearms. It will eliminate any possibility of the people defending themselves against a government that decides to end its constitutional restrictions. I know this is almost impossible, so it is not important, but historically, there have been incidents that could have been prevented by the ownership of firearms by private citizens. Some argue that parts of WWII and similar ethnic cleansing disasters could have been prevented in this way. The police simply did not enter. The police are the best detectives - they do not stop the killings, and crime does not happen. They gather evidence and are imprisoned after the truth. People say that our public safety officials will protect us, but I do not feel very confident. If we close down guns, law-abiding citizens will not put it in jeopardy. The number of illegal firearms can be alarmingly high - more than any other country that has banned firearms. Unless anyone can come up with a better idea of ​​how to eliminate guns in the country, I suggest that the system be unpopular with legitimate gun owners, but it will definitely solve the problem. Seek greater responsibility from gun owners. If someone steals your gun and uses it for murder, you are guilty of more serious wrongdoing than today. I can see that this is not important in last week's massacre (the owner of the gun killed himself), but it will fix a big problem. After a few high-profile cases, you can bet that anyone who wants to keep his or her guns will invest in a safe place of some sort.
1	When I started managing ADCs, I played vayne, because if you've mastered it here, it's more rewarding than any ADC. The only thing to keep in mind is that Vayne is bad at all-in situations when she does not have ult (Pre 6). You can do amazing games with her (1 sec fish in TFs), also she is a "hypercarry" (Means she will wear much better than most wear, due to her absurd damage.) However, Cait is completely the opposite. She's really good early game because of her long distance (650, most distance ADs have 550) so it's easy to snowball early. But I believe she caused the lowest damage match, someone calculated it.
1	When I started playing ADCs, I played vayne because when you get the hang of it, she's more valuable than any ADC. The only thing to keep in mind is that if Vayne doesn't have her ultimate (before level 6), she'll be bad in all situations. You can play great matches with her (1 second stealth action in TFs), and she's a "super carry" (meaning she'll carry better than most carries because of her ridiculous damage.) Cait however Quite the opposite. Her early game is really good as she has a good range (650, most ranged ADs have 550) so it can easily snowball early on. But I believe she has the lowest damage in the late game, someone has calculated it.
1	When I first started playing ADCs, I was playing Vayne, because when you've mastered here, it's more rewarding than any ADC. The only thing you need to keep in mind is that Vayne is bad in all-in situations if she doesn't have an ult (Pre 6). You can make some amazing plays with her (1 sec invis op in TFs), also she's a "hypercarry" (means she'll carry way better than most carries, because of her absurd damage.) Cait is everything though. opposite. She's really good in the early game due to her long range (650, most ranged ADs have 550), so it's easy to snowball early on.

1	When I started maintaining ADCs, I played vayne, because when you master here, it’s more rewarding than any ADC. The only thing you need to keep in mind is that Vayne is bad in all-in situations if there is no ult (Pre 6). You can do amazing games with it (1 second invis op in TFs), it's also "hypercarry" (meaning it will wear much better than most wears, due to its absurd damage.) Cait is, however, quite the opposite. She’s really good in the early game because of her long range (650, most long-range ads have 550) so it’s easy to catch snowballs early. As much as I believe it has the least damage in the lategame, someone has calculated it.
1	When I started focusing on ADC, I played in vain. Because when mastered here, she's more rewarding than any ADC. The only thing you should keep in mind is that Vayne is bad in all situations if she doesn't have an ult (Pre6). You can play great with her (1 second invis op in TF), and she's also a "hyper carry" (due to her ridiculous damage, she's much better than most carry Means to carry). She's a long range (650, most long range AD is 550), so she's prone to snowballing early on, so it's a very good early game. But I believe she has the least damage late in the game, someone calculated it.
1	Since we started playing adcs vayne, because when you're mastered here, it pays more than any ADC. It remains to be remembered that Vayne is evil in all things if he has no revenge (Pre 6). You can do amazing games with her (1 sec invisible op in TFs), she is also "hypercarry" (Means carry way better than most carries, due to absurd damage.) Cait does the opposite. Morning is a really good game because of the long distance (650, especially 550 ADs) making it easy to snowball in the morning. However, I believe lategame has the lowest damage, which someone has calculated.
1	When I started using ADCs, I played Vayne, because after mastering here, she's more rewarding than any ADC. The only thing you should keep in mind is that Vayne is bad in all-in situations if she does not have ult (Pre 6). You can make amazing toys with her (1 sec invis up in TFs), also she is a "hypercarry" (Means she will carry much better than most carriers, due to her absurd injuries.) However, Cait is the opposite. She is very good early due to her long range (650, most distance AD ​​has 550) and therefore it is easy to snowball early. But I think she has the lowest injury after the game, someone figured it out.
1	When I first started mastering ADCs, I played Vayne, because when you master here, she's more rewarding than any ADC. The only thing to keep in mind is that Vayne is bad in all-in situations if she doesn't have ult (Pre 6). You can make awesome plays with her (1 second invis op on TF), she's also a "hyper charge" (meaning she'll charge much better than most carries, due to her insane damage). However, Cait is the complete opposite. She's really good early game because of her long range (650, most ranged ADs are 550), so it's easy to snowball early on. I think she has the lowest late game damage though, someone calculated that.
1	When I started taking care of ADCs I played vayne, because when you succeed here, she is better than any ADC. The only thing you have to remember is that Vayne is bad in all cases if she does not have ult (Pre 6). You can do amazing games with him (sec 1 invis op in TFs), also he is "hypercarry" (It means he will carry a better way than carrying more, because of his ridiculous damage.) Cait however is quite the opposite. He’s a good early game because of his long line (650, most ADs have 550) so it’s very easy to hit the snowball early. However I believe he has the slightest damage to the late game, someone calculated that.
1	When I started growing ADC I played vayne, because once you have learned well here, you gain more than any ADC. The only thing you have to remember is that Vayne is bad in every case if he does not have the ult (Pre 6). You can do amazing games with him (1 second on TFs), and he's "hypercarry" (Which means he'll do better than most, because of his senseless damage.) Cait however vice versa. It is a very good pre-game due to its long distance (650, most ADs 550) so it is easy to play in the snow early. However I believe you have a very low damage to the lategame, someone calculated that.
1	You see how darius is on his way like a bull and is followed (!) By his teammates. He comes to you on flash + grab series - I flash You see singing run towards you on his ult - I flash before I'm thrown You see Jax set up his stun and in the series go for his jump (or flash jump) - I flash etc. All of the above when you are out of position and bruiser is followed by teammates. If he is not followed, just crush him because HE is the one out of position and your teammates are closer. Also, do not assume that this is the only truth - it's my style, mostly because I do not escape, like ashe or kog

He comes to you with a flash + grab range - I light up You see a song running towards you with its ult - I light up before I move You see a jax stopping something amazing and jumping into space to jump (or flash jump) - flash etc. All of the above if you are not in the area and the bruiser is followed by colleagues. If he is not followed then just crush him, because HE is the one who is not in the position and your colleagues are close. And don’t take this for granted - that’s my style, especially since I don’t have an escape adc like ashe or kog
1	First you should have run clean because they ran some strong cc. You can not afford to be initiated by snarling mockery and discouraged by the harm reduction or by being stunned by sona or feared by nocturne. Your net, your trap and your range should be enough to keep the divers at a distance. In these cases, it becomes even more difficult for champions like those to place a trap in front of you and to micros it, because they will get caught (even if he gets caught at night). Choose your targets wisely to take precautions first about what coolers the enemy team has on their skills. You knew Nocturne had edge ruins, so do not even try to get close to him or focus on him, as this will deprive your AS. Shen on the other hand can be "ignored" after teasing. You can probably take a few strokes from him and still be at about 55-65% at the end of a small skirmish. The biggest problem would be when both of them initiate on you. They become kind of an unbearable duo flying through the air that can take you down with ease. The only way to avoid focus is to not grow aggro or have an escape plan. You need to stay far away when team fights start, so you are less prioritized over your teammates. It makes them focus on them and not you and gives you free shots on them or maybe the others carry. If they initiate on you anyway, you need to have an escape plan up your sleeve. Just over a wall or flash, go into a forest to lose sight, place some traps, etc ... Edit:
1	First, you should run cleanse because they run some powerful cc. You can't afford to be activated by God's taunt, debuffed by damage reduction, stunned by Sona, or terrified by Nocturne. Your net, your trap, and your range should be enough to keep the diver away. In these cases, placing a trap in front of you and flicking around it will make it harder for heroes like those champions to keep attacking you because they'll be trapped (even if he's trapped noct ults). Start by choosing your targets wisely, paying attention to the enemy team's ability cooldowns. You know Nocturne has Randuin, so you shouldn't even try to get close to him or focus as that will cause you to get the AS debuff. On the other hand, Shen can be "ignored" after his taunting. You might get a few hits from him, but it's still around 55-65% by the end of the skirmish. The main problem is when both of them attack you. They turn into an unkillable duo that fly through the air and can knock you down with ease. The only way to avoid concentrating is not to increase hatred or make an escape plan. When teamfights start, you need to keep your distance so that you don't deprioritize your teammates. This lets them focus on them instead of you, and lets you shoot them or other carriers for free. If they do attack you, you need to have an escape plan. Net over walls or flashes, into bushes to relax sight, place some traps etc... EDIT:
1	First you should have run the cleanup as they were running strong cc's. You can't afford to be initiated by shens taunt and debuffed by damage reduction or stunned by sona or feared by nocturne. Your net, trap, and reach should be enough to keep divers at bay. In these cases, placing a trap in front of you and getting around it makes it even harder for champions like these to attack you as they will be trapped (even if they get caught). Choose your targets wisely at the start taking precautions on the enemy team's cooldowns on their skills. You knew Nocturne had randuins, so you shouldn't even try to get close to him or focus on him, because that would lead to you losing AS. Shen, on the other hand, can be "ignored" after he's mocked. You can probably take a few hits from him and still be 55-65% at the end of a small skirmish. The main issue would be when the two get introduced to you. They become a sort of invincible duo flying through the air that could easily knock you down. The only way to avoid focusing is to not get aggressive or have an escape plan. You need to stay away when team fights start so that you become less of a priority compared to your teammates. This allows them to focus on them and not you and gives you free hits on them or maybe the other door. If they attack you anyway, you must have an escape plan up your sleeve. Net over a wall or flash, get into a bush to lose sight of, place traps etc... Edit:
1	First of all, you should have run the cleanses because they were doing some strong cc. You cannot afford to be initiated by shens ridicule and to be reduced by harm reduction or you are stunned by sleep or you are afraid of nocturne. Your net, your trap and your range should be enough to keep divers away. In these cases, placing a trap in front of you and micro-finding around it makes it difficult for champions like these to attack you because they will be caught in a trap (even if he gets caught in a trap). Choose your targets wisely in the beginning by taking precautions about what cooling times the enemy team has on their skill set. You knew the Nocturne has randuines so you shouldn’t even try to get close to it or focus on it as this would lead you to debuff the AS. Shen, on the other hand, can be “ignored” after being ridiculed. You can probably take a few hits from him and still be at around 55-65% at the end of a small skirmish. The main problem would be if you both run. They become a kind of intrepid duo flying through the air that could easily knock you down. The only way to avoid focusing is not to become aggressive or have an escape plan. You have to stay away when team fights start to become less of a priority over your teammates. This makes them focus on them and not on you and gives you free shots on them or maybe others wear. If they go after you after all, you need to have an escape plan up your sleeve. Grid over the wall or flash, enter the bush to lose sight, set traps, etc ... Edit:
1	First of all, they were running some powerful cc, so they had to perform cleansing. Started by Shen's taunts, you can't afford to be debuffed by reduced damage, stunned by Sona, or afraid of nocturnality. Your net, your trap, and your range must be sufficient to keep divers away. In these cases, if you put a trap in front of you and move it micro-moving around it, they will be cursed, making it even harder for champions like them to chase you (even if he was trapped). Even if). Initially, take precautions on what cooldowns your enemy team will have against your skill set and choose your target wisely. You shouldn't even try to approach or even focus on him, as you knew that Nocturne had a Randuin, which would lead to debuffing the AS. Shen, on the other hand, can be "ignored" after provoking. You can probably get a few hits from him and still be like 55-65% at the end of a small skirmish. The main problem is when both start you. They become a kind of indelible duo flying in the air and can easily defeat you. The only way to avoid concentration is to not grow aggro or plan an escape. You need to stay far away when the team fight begins so that it has a lower priority than your teammates. This allows them to focus on them, not you, and give them and other carry free shots. If they start you anyway, you need to make an escape plan on your sleeve. Cover walls and flashes with a net, get into bushes and lose visibility, put traps ... Edit:
1	First of all you need to clean up, because some of the heroes were running 200 You can't be initiated by shens abuse and weakened by loss reduction or panic stricken or dreaded nighttime. Let your nets, traps, and your guard be sufficient to guard the different bays. In these cases, placing a trap in front of you and being surrounded by it makes it more difficult for defenders to approach you because they are trapped (even if last night there was a trap). Choose your targets wisely first, guaranteeing an enemy team around which it cools your skills. You knew you had randuinos during the night, so don't even try to approach him or focus on him because he'll lead you to the corpse. Sen, on the other hand, can be "ignored" after he taunts him. You can probably get a two-hit from him, and you still have to be like 55-65% at the end of small skirmishes. The main question would be when both of you initiate. They become like two uninformed flying through the air that weigh you down easily. The only way to avoid getting focus is to avoid aggro increases or an escape plan. You need to stay far away when you initiate teamfights in order to become less prioritized over your teammates. This makes them live and not you, and gives you shots without them, or perhaps carries another. If you start over yourself anyways you need to have an escape plan up your sleeve. Net on the wall or flash, go into the bush to see, undo, set traps etc... Edit:
1	First of all you should have run cleanse because they ran some strong cc. You can not afford to be initiated by scorn and be swept away by the harm reduction or be paralyzed by the zone or feared by the night. Your net, trap and range should be enough to keep divers in check. In these cases, placing a trap in front of you and the micro around it will make it even harder for masters like them to walk on you because they will be caught (even if night owls are caught). Choose your goals carefully by first taking precautions about which cooldowns the enemy team has on their skill set. You knew that Nocturne had randuins, so you should not even try to get close to him or focus on him because it would cause you to be AS deflected. Shen, on the other hand, can be "ignored" after mocking. You can probably take a couple of hits from him and still be at 55-65% at the end of a small hit. The main problem will be when both start on you. They become a kind of immortal duo flying through the air that can take you down with ease. The only way to avoid being focused is to not grow aggro or have an escape plan. You have to stay far when the team matches start, so that you are less prioritized over your teammates. This allows them to focus on them and not you and gives you free shots at them or maybe the other bearer. If they initiate on you anyway, you need to have an escape plan up your sleeve. Net over a wall or flash, go into a bush to lose sight, place some traps etc ... Edit:
1	I should have done a cleanup in the first place because they were running some heavy cc's. You can't afford to be started by shens taunt and be nerfed by damage reduction or stunned by sona or feared by nocturne. Your net, trap, and reach should be enough to keep divers at bay. In these cases, setting up a trap in front of you and microing around it makes it even harder for champions like those to attack you because they'll get caught (even if it's not an ultimate, they'll get caught). Choose your targets wisely early on by being careful about what cooldowns the enemy team has on their skill set. You knew Nocturne had randuins, so you shouldn't even try to get close to him or focus on him because it would lead to an AS debuff. Shen, on the other hand, can be "ignored" after he taunts her. You can probably take a couple of hits from him and still be at 55-65% at the end of a small skirmish. The main problem would be when both start you. They become some sort of unkillable duo that fly through the air and could easily take you down. The only way to avoid concentrating is to not get aggressive or have an escape plan. You should stay away when team fights start so that you have less priority over your teammates. This causes them to focus on them and not on you and gives you free kicks towards them or perhaps towards the others. If you get started anyway, you should have an escape plan up your sleeve. Put a net on a wall or a flash, go to a bush to lose sight, set some traps, etc. Edit:
1	First you had to run clean because they were running a strong cc. You can’t afford to be initiated by savage jokes and confused by the reduction of damage or to be surprised by the sona or to be feared by the night. Your net, your trap and your variety should be enough to keep divers at bay. In these situations placing a trap in front of you and swinging it makes it even harder for champions like those who keep you going because they will get caught (even if they get caught). Choose your goals wisely at the outset taking care of the problems that the enemy team has in their skills. You knew that Nocturne had randuins so you should not even try to approach him or stress him out because it would lead you to get AS debuffed. Shen on the other hand can be “overlooked” after being ridiculed. Maybe you can take a few hits from him and still be like 55-65% at the end of a small dispute. The biggest problem will be when they both start with you. They become the kind of two-person people flying across the sky that can easily land you. The only way to avoid focusing is to not have an escape plan. You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people. This makes them focus on them and not on you and gives you free pictures for them or maybe some carry. If they are going to start you off though, you need to have an escape plan in your hand. Net on the wall or slope, go to the bush so you can't see well, set traps etc ... Edit:
1	First you had to run clean because they were running o strong cc. You will not be able to initiate shens ridicule and be wary of minimizing damage or being surprised by sona or scared at night. Your net, your trap, and your scope should be large enough to keep divers away. In these cases placing the trap in front of you and wandering around makes it even harder for champions like these to keep up with you because they will be caught in the trap (even if they are not caught in the trap). Choose your target wisely first by taking safety precautions about what the enemy team has cool elements in their skills plan. You knew that Nocturne had randuin so you should not try to approach him or concentrate on him as it will lead to AS being released. Shen on the other hand can be "ignored" after being teased. You can probably take a few hits from him and still be 55-65% at the end of a small argument. The biggest problem would be if they both start with you. Be the kind of inanimate duo flying in the air that can easily bring you down. The only way to avoid focusing too much on not growing aggro or having an escape plan. You need to stay away from gangs when you are fighting so that you do not put your interests ahead of your peers. This makes them focus on themselves and not on you and gives you free shots for them or maybe someone else to carry. If they start with you however you need to have an escape plan in your sleeve. Net over a wall or flash, get into a tree so you can't see well, set traps etc ... Edit:
1	I'm middle, but since I'm at school, I will respond to your questions in this thread and I can not go to my client. (IGN: Pho Oh Three) My s2 Elo Range (2.2k-2.8k) played along with all sorts of high elo top-level people. My S3 Elo (2k +) Generally in the lower level Elo series, Eve can pedal very well, because in the lower level lanes do not use pink wards to stop Eve ganks and will not have the game knowledge as much as higher elo- level players. In Higher elo, teams will use pink wards to counter your early ganks and place level 6 ganks. And also in higher elo, are most forbidden hero atm: Eve, Nunu, LeeSin, Katarina, Twisted Fate, Khaizx, Amumu, Pantheon, Shaco. So as you get higher, you will have less chances to play Eve, so start learning more OP heroes. There are many OP heroes and you can not ban them all.
1	I'm mostly mid-term, but since I'm in school and I'll answer your questions in this thread, I can't continue my clients. (IGN: Pho Oh Three) My s2 Elo Range (2.2k-2.8k) played with various high elo tops. My S3 Elo (2k+) is usually in the low level Elo range and Eve can trample well because at low level lanes don't use pink guards to stop Eve ganks and don't have as much as higher level players have game knowledge. In higher level elos, teams will use pink guards against your early ganks and level 6 ganks. And in higher level elo, the most banned heroes are: Eve, Nunu, LeeSin, Katarina, Twisted Fate, Khaizx, Amumu, Pantheon, Shaco. So as you get taller, you get less and less chance to play Eve, so start learning more OP heroes. There are so many OP heroes, you can't ban them all.
1	I'm a principal but since I'm in school I'll answer your questions in this thread and I can't go on about my client. (IGN: Pho Oh Three) My Elo s2 range (2.2k-2.8k) has played with all sorts of high profile people. My S3 Elo (2k+) Usually in the lower tier Elo range Eve can stomp very well because in the lower tier the lanes don't use pink pads to stop Eve's ganks and wouldn't have as much knowledge about the game than higher elo players. In Higher elo teams will use pink beacons to counter your first ganks and post level 6 ganks. And also in higher elo most banished heroes are: Eve, Nunu, LeeSin, Katarina, Twisted Fate, Khaizx, Amumu , Pantheon, Shaco. So as you level up you will be less likely to play Eve so start learning more OP heroes. There are a lot of OP heroes and you can't ban them all.

My S3 Elo (2k +) Generally in the lower Elo range, Eve can tread very well because at lower levels, the tracks don't use pink wards to stop Eve's porches and wouldn't have as much knowledge about the game as higher elo level players. In Higher El, teams will use pink wards to counter your early porches even after level 6. And also in the higher el, the most forbidden heroes of atm are: Eve, Nunu, LeeSin, Katarina, Twisted Fate, Khaizx, Amumu, Pantheon, Shaco. So as you progress, you will have less chance of playing Eve so start learning more OP heroes. There are a lot of OP heroes and you can't ban them all.
1	I'm half-baked, but I'm in school, so I'll answer your question in this thread, and I can't go to my client. (IGN: Pho Oh Three) My s2 Elo Range (2.2k-2.8k) played with all sorts of high erotic top tier people. My S3Elo (2k +) In general, in the lower Tier Elo range, Eve can step very well. In the lower tiers, Lane doesn't use the pink ward to stop Eve gunk and isn't as knowledgeable about the game as the players in the upper Elo tiers. In Higher elo, the team uses pink wards to counter early gunks and post level 6 gunks. Also, at higher elo, the most forbidden heroes atm are Eve, Nunu, LeeSin, Katalina, Twisted Fate, Khaizx, Amumu, Pantheon and Shaco. Therefore, the higher you get, the less chance you have to play Eve, so start learning more OP heroes. There are many OP heroes, and not all can be banned.

My S3 Elo (2k+) Usually in the lower tier Elo range, Eva dashes really well because in the lower tier, lanes don't use pink guard to stop Eva ganks and not the game's knowledge as much as higher elo tier players. On the upper elo, we need to use rose-pairs for your first lamb and 6 level rafter frames. And even in the above code, the heroes are mostly banned: Eva, Nunu, LeeSin, Katarina, Twisted Fate, Khaizx, Amumu, Pantheon, Shaco. As you climb higher, you'll get less chances to play Eve, so you're beginning to learn more about OP's heroes. There are alot of OP heroes, and you can't ban them all.

1	I do not think this is a very good proposal. Not to sound like I'm per se one of those “exclusive” bullshit, but I paid real money for skins I like and want to brag about. -If Lee Sin is free, I want to play him. In champ select everyone and their mom thinks "oh god its free week lee ready to kick away from team". Then the loading screen appears with the Dragon Fist splash art. While that may not mean I'm a pro at the champion I play, it does mean for someone to own an expensive champion AND a skin that they are at least a little seasoned with that champion. -This is not always the case, but skins = skill to some extent. I invested 1820 RP in Brolaf, but only after playing him for a very long time. If anyone has a skin, then they logically plan to play that champion for a long time / have they already played. -I know we all know that person who immediately buys a champion and skin with them, or the people who are new to a champion and have a skin that was for sale, but the vast majority of people who own skins have an idea of ​​what they're doing with that champion. Making skins free for weekend champions will cause unnecessary confusion while also reducing sales. Why do I have to convince a random person that I own Lee Sin and X from his skins just because Lee is free? What if I suck at Galio but I use Gatekeeper and I miss an ult "GG this freeweek skin but 0 skill" or "this noob says he has galio legen. Skin look he miss fkin ult". -One of the reasons why I personally believe that riot does not implement a direct skin viewer tool is because the image that the skin splatter has, as opposed to the in-game model. I would never have bought Muay Thai Lee while I knew what the animations were, but the skin came out, I happened to be a Lee chief, and I wanted to own all his skins (and the splash looks really good).

What if I miss "looks like"? -One of the reasons I personally believe that riots don't implement skin viewer tools directly is because of the skin splash images as opposed to the in-game model. You wouldn't have bought Muay Thai while you knew what the animation was, but the skin came out and happened to be Lee's main and wanted to own all his skins (and splash). Looks really good).
1	I don't think this plan is very good. I don't like to sound like one of those "exclusive" assholes per se, but I like and want real money for the skins that I show them. -If it's Lee Sin, I want to play it. Everyone chooses the champto and his mother thinks "oh god lee are preparing to kick off their free week out of the team". Then load the screen pops up with the skill of Dragon Fist splash. While it might not mean that I'm playing as a champion, it means that someone has a beloved champion and a bottle, I order at least a little seasoned. - This is not always true , but bottles = LONG experience . I placed the 1820 RP in Brolaf, but only after playing it for quite a long time. If anyone has a skin, then they deal logically with the game that he has played for a long time as a defender. -I know we all know that a person who buys a boxer and a skin is with them immediately, or people who are new to the order and have a skin for sale, but generally many of them who have an idea about their skins. what are you doing with this champion? Free skins on freeweeks might make unnecessary bits of confusion, while sales are also decreasing. Why do you try to convince a random person that I have Lee Sin and 10 skins because Lee is free? What if I'm buying in Galio but I'm using a porter and I miss the last "gg on this skin freeweek but 0 art" or "this noob says he has a galio fashion. The skin looks fkin ult". One of the reasons I believe luxury is that the device doesn't create a direct viewer's skin, because the image of the skin is contrasted with the gameplay model. I would never have bought Lee Muay Thai until I knew what the animations were, but my skin turned out to be, perhaps, Lee's main character, and I wanted to have all kinds of skins (plus it looks really good on color).
1	I do not think this is a very good suggestion. Not to sound like I'm one of the "exclusive" assholes in itself, but I paid real money for leather I like and want to show off. -If Lee Sin is free, I will play him. In champ select everyone and their mother thinks "oh my god, it's free week, prepare to kick from the team". Then the loading screen with the Dragon Fist spray art appears. While that may not mean I'm a pro at the master I play, it does mean that someone owns an expensive master AND a skin that they are at least a little experienced with that master. -This is not always true, but skins = separate to some degree. I have invested 1820 RP in Brolaf, but only after playing him for an extremely long time. If someone has a skin, then they logically plan to play that champion for a long time / have already played them. -I know we all know the person who buys a champion and skin with them right away, or those who are new to a champ and have a skin that was on sale, but the general majority of people who own skins have an idea about what they do with that master. Making leather free for freeweek champs will cause unnecessary confusion while reducing sales. Why would I have to convince a random person that I own Lee Sin and X of his skins just because Lee is free? What if I suck at Galio, but I use Gatekeeper and I miss an ult "GG this freeweek skin but 0 skill" or "this nooben says he has galio doctor. Skin look he missed fkin ult". -One of the reasons why I personally think that riot does not implement a direct skin display tool is because the image the skin spray has in contrast to the model in the game. I would never have bought Muay Thai Lee while I knew what the animations were, but the skin came out, I happened to be a Lee main, and I wanted to own all his skins (plus the splash looks really good).

In champ he selects everyone and his mom is thinking "oh god it's a week off lee get ready to kick away from the team". Then the loading screen appears with the Dragon Fist splash art. While it may not mean I'm a pro at the champion I'm playing, just because someone has an expensive champion AND a skin means they have at least some experience with that champion. -This is not always true, but skins=skill to SOME EXTENT. I've invested 1820 RP in Brolaf, but only after playing with him for a long time. If someone has a skin, they logically plan to play that champion for a long time or have already played it. I know we all know that person who buys a champion and a skin with them right away, or people who are new to a champion and have a skin that was on sale, but the general majority of people who own skins have a no idea what they're doing with that champion. Making skins free for bye week champions would cause unnecessary confusion while also decreasing sales. Why should I have to convince some random person that I own Lee Sin and X from his skins just because Lee is free? What if I suck at Galio but I'm using Gatekeeper and I miss an ult "GG this week skin off but 0 skill" or "this newbie says he has legen galio. skin skin missed fkin's ult". One of the reasons I personally think Riot doesn't implement a direct skin display tool is because the image that the skin splatter has is different than the in-game model. I never would have bought Muay Thai Lee knowing what the animations were, but the skin came out, I happen to be a main Lee and wanted to get all the skins on him (plus the splatter looks great).
1	I don't think this is a very good suggestion. It doesn’t sound like I’m one of those “unique” fools for every second, but I paid real money for the skins I love and want to show off. -If Lee Sin is free, I want to play him. In the Champ select everyone and their mother are thinking "Oh god its free week lee get ready to leave the team". Then the screen loading will occur with the hybrid art of Dragon Fist. Although it may not mean that I am a champion champion, for someone to own an expensive champion AND leather means they have experience with that champion. -This is not always true, but skins = skill to SOME EXTENT. I have invested 1820 RP for Brolaf, but only after playing him for a very long time. If someone has skin, then logically he plans to play the champion for a long time / he has already played. -I know we all know the person who buys the champion and leather with him directly, or people who are new to the champion and have the skin that was being sold, but generally most people who own the leather have an idea of ​​what they are doing with that champion. Free skinning for free weekly champions can lead to unnecessary frustration while also reducing sales. Why would I convince someone randomly that I own Lee Sin and X's skin just because Lee is free? Am I sucking Galio but I use a gatekeeper and I miss "GG this week free skin but skill 0" or "this noob says he has galio leg. Skin look he missed fkin ult". -One of the reasons I personally believe that violence does not implement the tool for looking at the skin directly is because the image of the skin is contrary to the internal style of the game. I would never have bought Muay Thai Lee as I knew what animation was, but the skin came out, I am the main Lee, and I wanted to own all of its skins (plus splash looks very nice).
1	I don’t think this is a very good suggestion. Not to sound like I'm one of those "special" assholes, but I've paid real money for the skins I love and want to show off. -When Lee Sin is free, I want to play him. At the champ pick everyone and their mom thinks "oh god its a free church so get ready to kick off the party". Then loading the screen appears with Dragon Fist splash art. While it may not mean that I am the champion I play, for someone to have an expensive champion AND skin means they are at least older than that champion. -This is not always true, but skins = ability TO SOMETHING. I invested 1820 RP in Brolaf, but after playing him for a very long time. If someone has skin, then you logically plan to play that champion for a long time / you already played him. -I know we all know the person who buys the champion and removes the skin right away, or people who have just got the champion and have the skin on sale, but most people with skins have an idea of ​​what to do with that champion. Making skins free at weekly champs can create unnecessary confusion while minimizing sales. Why should I convince a random person to hold Lee Sin and X for his skin because Lee is comfortable? What if I sucked Galio but I use the Gatekeeper and I miss the ult "GG this free skin of the week but 0 ability" or "this noob says it has galio legen. Skin look he missed fkin ult". -One of the reasons why I personally believe that chaos is not using a straight skinned tool because the image with the skin is against the in-game model. I wouldn’t have bought Muay Thai Lee when I knew what the animations were, but the skin came out, I happened to be the main Lee, and I wanted to own all of his skins (and the splash looks really good).
1	Hello Leo! My name is also Leo and I am also from Brazil: O I played a few months of 1-30 and transferred silver in the ranking on the NA server and to BR during the second wave of free transfers. Personally I know the NA server has a lot of trolls and flamers I just feel the BR is more passionate. They use VERY colorful language and would actually be pretty witty if they weren't so angry all the time. BRs tend to lose their coolness faster and it's really annoying to deal with, but do not think other servers do not have people like this either. The best way to handle this is to play with friends (add Barten01 if you ever want to play on the BR server) and mute anyone trying to ruin your game. I speak from experience on the NA and BR servers, but I am 100% applicable to the EU, Asia and any other servers out there.

1	If you just look at it right away (have not read through it, but have read through it), a few format-like changes will make the guide much more attractive and easier to read. In some parts it seems that you have forgotten how to separate long posts into paragraphs. In the areas where you seem to have paragraphs, there is no space in between and just makes the guide harder to read. Honestly I say quite "no thank you, do not read it" because it looks like a massive wall of text.
1	Just look at it now (not read through, but skim) some similar formatting changes will make the guide more engaging and easier to read.

1	If it's boring, do not look. I actually like to look at Asian teams, just because how much better they are than the rest, the benchmark is set higher, so if you want to win the cash prize, get better, take the game seriously and just practice more. If they can do it, anyone else can. The only thing Asians do differently is that they take the game seriously, because that's how they make a living. The other regions do not seem to take it too seriously, they can make a living from streaming so they do not make too much effort to really win tournaments.

Why not use the two pulls of the chain before flying to them, and then strike back with Flay? Ofc, there are times and places where you just want to fly to them as soon as possible to save or initiate someone, but that's all judgment.

1	This I've done this since the first day of Thresh came out, and it greatly increases the amount of time you have in your power. Why don't you use two claws before flying over to them, then thrashing with Flayo? Ofc, there are times and places where you just want to fly to them ASAP to save or invest, but it's all right.

Why not use the two moves in the chain before flying to them and then strike them back with Flay?

1	Actually, the cart thing is that her 3rd Q-cast hits the ground immediately, and the animation of Riven doing a front flip comes later, which is not supposed to happen. And also when you want to do 3rd Q and fast W, it feels delayed as fuck.
1	In fact, the problem is that her third Q cast instantly slams the ground, and Riven's front flip animation follows, which shouldn't happen. And when you want to do a third Q and a quick W, it feels like a fucking delay.

1	In fact, the bug is that her third Q-cast hits the ground instantly, and Riven's animation of a front flip comes later. Also, when I want to do a fast W with the third Q, I feel a delay as sexual intercourse.
1	Actually, the buggy thing is that its 3 Q ejected instantly slams to the ground, and the animation Riven does later comes with a front flip, which is not going to happen. And even when you want to do 3 Q and fast W, it feels like fuck off until.
1	Actually, it's buggy that her third Q-crew hits the ground immediately, and the animation of Riven doing a front flip comes later, which is not going to happen. And also when you want to do 3. Q and fast W, it feels delayed.
1	Actually, the problem is that her 3rd Q throw hits the ground instantly, and the animation of Riven doing a front flip comes after, which isn't supposed to happen. And also when you want to do 3rd Q and W fast, he feels retarded as shit.
1	In fact, the thing that bothers me is that his 3rd Q character hits it down right away, and the animation of Riven making a forward turn comes later, which should not happen. And also when you want to do Q 3 and W quickly, it feels delayed like a fuck.
1	In fact, the problem is that his third Q characters hit the ground running right away, and Riven's flickering of the front flip comes later, which should not have happened. And again if you want to do a 3rd Q and a quick W, it sounds like a delay.

From memory, the LoL infographics on players showed that more than 90% of LoL players are male, meaning less than 10% are female.

1	From what I've been playing, it seems like the people you're playing with or against are a major determinant in how many points you get. I'm currently a silver 5, but when I play with a few golden friends, they all complain about getting 10-15 points from a win while I get 20-30 league points. I later played with some bronze friends and I was the one who got a few points, and then after a finish for a loss, I lost a lot of points. The reason I lost so many points is to lose to people with such a lower hidden match rating.

1	Muramana is an amazing item on Ryze, anyone can tell you. Iceborn gauntlet is not an item I like to build early. Ryze, like any other wizard, will also cause automatic attacks in team fights if he is not under pressure, so the slow can be useful, but the damage to the ice-born glove proc is barely noticeable. The two items (muramana and ice-born glove) do not really match, as the ice-born glove adds 1.25x your base ad, hence not the bonus ad obtained by muramana. Compared to frozen heart it gives slightly more mana and it gives ap in exchange for less armor and no active and less cdr. So it's worth upgrading your glacier casing if you already have CDR limited and you do not need the attack speed slowly, but I will not get it until you have got all your other items as it is so damn expensive is (it's like a 2k upgrade cost of glacier cover).
1	Muramana is a great outfit from Ryze, anyone can tell you. The Iceborn Gauntlet is not an item I like to make early on. Ryze, like any other mage, also auto-attacks in teamfights if he's not under pressure, so slows are useful, but the damage to Iceborn Gauntlets is barely noticeable. The two projects (muramana and iceborn gauntlet) don't actually synergize, as iceborn gauntlet adds 1.25x base ads, so not rewarded ads from muramana. Compared to Frozen Heart, it gives more mana and gives AP in exchange for less armor, no active and less cdr. So if you already have a CDR cap and don't need the attack speed reduction, it's worth upgrading your glacier shield to gloves, but I wouldn't get it until you have everything else because it's too expensive (it's like 2k upgrade cost for Glacial Shroud).
1	Muramana is a great article on Ryze, anyone can tell you that. The Iceborn Gauntlet is not an item I like to build at first. Ryze, like any other mage, will also land auto attacks in teamfights if not under pressure, so the slow can be helpful, but the damage on the Frost Gauntlet's proc is barely noticeable. The two items (muramana and iceborn gauntlet) are not actually synergized since the iceborn gauntlet adds 1.25x your base advert, so not the bonus advert obtained from muramana. Compared to Frozen Heart, it gives slightly more mana and it gives ap in exchange for less armor and no active cdr and less. So it's worth upgrading your Glacial Shroud for the Gauntlet if you're already CDR limited and don't need slow attack speed, but I wouldn't get it until you wouldn't have all your other items, because it's damn expensive (it's like a 2k upgrade cost from Glacial Shroud).
1	Muramana is a great item on Ryze, anyone can tell you. Iceborn gloves are not an item I like to build early. Ryze will, like any other magician, also perform auto attacks in team fights if not pressed so slowness can be helpful, but the damage to the iceborn gauntlet proc is barely noticeable. The two items (muramana and iceborn glove) actually have no synergy since the iceborn glove adds 1.25x your base ad, so not the bonus ad obtained from muramana. Compared to a frozen heart it gives slightly more flaws and gives ap in exchange for less armor and no active and less cdr. So it’s worth upgrading your glacial cover to gauntlet up if you’re already limited to CDR and don’t need a slow attack speed, but I wouldn’t get it until you get all your other items because it’s so damn expensive (it’s like a 2k upgrade cost of glacial cover).
1	Muramana is a great item for Rise, anyone can tell you. The Iceborn Gauntlet is not an item I like to build early on. Like any mage, if he's not under pressure, he'll land an auto-attack in Team Fight, so throws are useful, but the damage to the Iceborn Gauntlet proc is barely noticeable. The Iceborn Gauntlet adds 1.25 times the base ad, so the two items (Muramana and Iceborn Gauntlet) don't really synergize. Therefore, no bonus ads from Muramana will be added. Compared to a frozen heart, it gives slightly more mana, which gives ap in exchange for less armor and less active and less cdr. So if you already have a CDR limit and you don't need to slow down your attack, it's worth upgrading your glacier shroud to a gauntlet, but not until you get all the other items. (It's like the cost of a 2k upgrade from an ice shroud).
1	Muramana is a great item in Ryze, no one can tell you. Iceborn glove is not an item I like to stay in the building. Ryze, like any other sorcerer, even scares his car with punches if not pressed, as slow as it can be useful, but the damage to the ice proc boxing is barely noticeable. Two things (muramana and icy gloves) actually don't synergize because the frozen gauntlet adds 1.25x to your base, so you won't get the bonus you won from muramana. Frozen Hearts gives slightly more mana and ap for less armor and not actually and less cdr. It is therefore worth upgrading your icy shirt to the gauntlet even if you already have CDR capped and you don't need a sluggish attack speed, but I won't get until you've got all the rest of you, since you're so damn costly. (like a 2k upgrade cost from an ice napkin).
1	Muramana is a great item on Ryze, anyone can tell you. Iceborn glove is not an item I like to build early. Ryze like any other belly will also land auto attacks in teamfights if he is not pressured, so slow can be helpful, but the damage to the ice-born glove-proc is barely noticeable. The two elements (muramana and iceborn glove) do not actually have synergy since the iceborn glove adds 1.25x your basic ad, so not the bonus ad you get from muramana. Compared to frozen heart, it gives a little more mana and it gives ap in exchange for less armor and no active and less cdr. So it's worth upgrading your mailbox to jump up if you'm already CDR limited and you do not need the slow attack speed, but I would not get it until you have all your other items, since it's so damn expensive (it is like a 2k upgrade cost from glacial shroud).
1	Muramana is a great item on Ryze, anyone can tell you. The Iceborn Gauntlet is not an item I like to build from scratch. Ryze, like any other mage, will also auto-attack in teamfights if he's not pressed, so the slow can be useful, but the damage in the process of the ice gauntlet is barely noticeable. The two items (muramana and gauntlet of the iceborn) don't actually have synergy, as the gauntlet of the iceborn adds 1.25 times its base ad, so not the bonus ad gained from muramana. Compared to frozen heart it gives slightly more mana and gives ap in exchange for less armor and less active and less cdr. So it's worth upgrading your glacial cloak if you already have a CDR cap and don't need the attack speed to be slow, but wouldn't get it until you have all your other items as it's so expensive. (it's like a 2k glacial deck upgrade cost).
1	Muramana is a good product on Ryze, anyone can tell you. The Iceborn Gauntlet is not something I like to build early. Ryze like any other mage will also get an automatic attack in a team fight if he is not pressed so slow motion can be important, but damage to the iceborn gauntlet proc is not easily seen. These two products (muramana and iceborn gauntlet) are not compatible as the ice gauntlet increases your base ad by 1.25 times, so it is not a bonus advertisement received from muramana. Compared to a frozen heart, it gives more manna and gives ap instead of less weapons and no live cdr and less. So it is advisable to update your ice sheet to get up if you have already installed the CDR and do not need a slow attack speed, but I would not get it until you have all your other items, as they are very expensive. (it's like the cost of a 2k upgrade from an ice sheet).
1	Muramana is a good thing in Ryze, anyone can tell you. Iceborn gauntlet is not something I like to build early. Ryze like any other mage will also automatically attack the team battles if he is not pressed to make the slow move useful, but the damage to the iceborn gauntlet proc is undetectable. The two items (muramana and iceborn gauntlet) do not actually mix as iceborn gauntlet adds your basic ad by 1.25 times, so not a bonus ad found in muramana. Compared to frozen heart it provides more mana and provides ap by exchanging smaller weapons and no more effective cdr and less. It is therefore advisable to upgrade your glacial shroud to gauntlet up if you are already bound with CDR and you do not need a bit of attack speed, but I will not get it until you get all your other items, because they are very expensive. (similar to 2k development costs from glacial shroud).

When guesses put him at 14-16 years old, I have not bonded with any animal in my life deeper than JD. The past few years have been a constant state of worry. It was when he started losing his teeth that I became worried. It was when he lost his first dog that I started to panic. Unfortunately, my advice for current elderly dog ​​owners would be, you know. Chances are it will not blind you (well, it will, but not how you think). He was such a crazy, high energy, little thing that I thought he would go out like a light bulb. One minute jumps around like he always did. Next death stroked. No, one day he just decided he was not going to eat anymore. Because I was a yorkie (stubborn eaters), I was through with it and did not allow for 3 days for his denial of food. Then I said goodbye and got him a new brand in hopes of getting his attention. Then I tried to go to what made him eat when I first got him, lunch meat. After a week, I became desperate and got a baby syringe and started feeding him meat-based baby food. I was then unemployed. It was awful. I basically just lay with him and died with him. It was 2 or 3 weeks of my full days spent lying with him, trying to force him to feed baby food every 2 to 3 hours, watching him waste, as hard as I could hope he would just eat something on his own again . It got to the point where he would get up and try to walk to his dog house, and could only take a step or 2 before collapsing. After this back and forth, he tried to get out to his dog house but could not make it, I picked him up again and brought him back to the couch, I tried to feed him again and he immediately threw the food back. It looked painful and sounded. I wrestled with the thought, but that was the moment I thought "I need to call the vet". I could not compose myself enough to make the call, so my wife called a local mobile vet for us. I took him to his backyard, and he had a burst of energy (I think he knew) that he had not had in weeks. Strong enough to walk halfway from the backyard to his favorite spot.

Then I tried to see what I gave him when I first found him, luncheon meat. A week later I got desperate, bought a baby syringe and started feeding him meat based baby food. I was unemployed at the time. That's too bad. I basically just lay down with him and die with him.

At this point they had guessed him for about 8-10 years. When I made guesses that he was 14-16 years old, no animal in my life joined me more deeply than JD. The last two years have been constantly worrying. I started to lose teeth when I was worried. The dog lost the first time when it started to tremble. Unfortunately, I advise owners to let elderly dogs know that they will be racing. You are wont to blind your discord (he wishes well, but not how you think). He was such a crazy man, with great energy, a small thing that he figured like a light bulb. One minute hopping like he always did. The stricken neighbor died. No, on a certain day he determined that he ought to eat more. With York (stubborn eating) I hadn't been through it for 3 days and I was catered to by food negation. Then I holed up with him and found a new brand hoping to get his attention. Then I attempted to go to that which I ate for dinner when I had found the first flesh.

It looked and sounded painful. He had been struggling with the thought, but that was the moment I thought "I need to call the vet." I couldn't calm down enough to make the call, so my wife called a local mobile vet for us. She took him out to her backyard and she had a burst of energy (I think she knew that) that she hadn't had in weeks. Strong enough to walk half the backyard to his favorite spot.

When I think they put him at 14-16 years old, I had no close relationship with no animal in my life other than JD. A few years ago it was a state of constant anxiety. That's when he started losing his teeth and that's when I got worried. It was when he lost his first dog that I started to panic. Unfortunately, my advice to current adult dog owners will be, you will know. Most likely, it will not stop you (well, it will, but not the way you think). He was so crazy, so powerful, something so small that I thought he would come out like a bulb. One minute flying like he always did. Next stroked out dead. No, one day he just decided he would never eat again. As a yorkie (conservative consumer), I went through it and did not accept his deprivation of food for 3 days. Then I got scared and brought him a new brand hoping to get his attention. Then I tried to go to what made him eat when I found him, meat for lunch. One week later, I became disillusioned with the injection mold and began feeding him baby meat. I was not working at the time. It was horrible. Basically I just slept with him and died with him. It was 2 or 3 weeks of spending my full days sleeping with her, trying to feed her baby every 2 to 3 hours, watching her degenerate, hoping as hard as I could that she would just eat something on her own again. . It got to the point where he would get up and try to walk up to his dog house, and he could only hit a step or 2 before falling.

It appeared and sounded bitter. I was struggling with the idea, but that was when I thought "I need to call a veterinarian". I couldn’t compose myself enough to make a phone call, so my wife called a local veterinarian for us.

0	A yorkie appeared in front of my yard. I put up billboards and looked for local veterinarians and the police department, but no one came looking for him. At the time, they speculated that he was 8-10 years old. When speculation put him 14-16 years old, I was committed to having no pet in my life deeper than JD. The past few years have been a constant state of anxiety. As she began to relax, I began to worry. It was then that he lost his first dog when I started to panic. Unfortunately, my advice to older dog owners right now would be, you will know. It probably won’t blind you (well, it will happen, but not the way you think). He was so crazy, so powerful, so small that I thought he was going to come out like a lantern. One minute jumping as he always did. Next he was beaten to death. No, one day he decided he would never eat again. As a yorkie (stubborn), I had been through it and did not face his denial of food for three days. Then I wrapped up and found her a new breed in the hope that she would take care of me. Then I tried to go to what made him eat when I first found him, meat for lunch. One week later, I became disillusioned with the baby and began feeding him meat. I was not working at the time. It was horrible. I actually just slept with her and died with her. It was 2 or 3 weeks I spent my full days sleeping with him, trying to force him to feed the baby every two to 3 hours, watching him waste, hoping as much as possible that he would just eat something on his own again. . It got to the point where he got up and tried to get to his dog house, and he would be able to take a step or two before he collapsed. After this back and forth, trying to get to her dog house, but unable to get there, I picked her up and put her back on the couch, tried to feed her and she just threw the food. .

I could not control myself enough to make a phone call, so my wife called a local veterinarian.

To me, it seems to be a few things, a lot of stress at work, being exhausted as a result makes it actually unattractive to have sex; It's just so much work to make her happy, where 5 minutes and an internet connection is easy. I would not say she let herself go, but she is not the same girl as before figuratively and it plays a role, as well as a bit of boredom and what I like to call "grass is greener syndrome".

0	I spent 5 years at Office Depot as a part-time worker. The first 2 years were good for me because I was still in school and part time was all I could handle. After I got out of school, I told them I wanted a full-time job. The boss said there was not one available but he will take care of me and promised I can get one after it is available. Cut to 3 years later and I still worked there part time. If I think back, I should have left MUCH sooner than I did. I applied for a few jobs over the course of those 3 years, but never seriously looked for better jobs, with the idea that Office Depot would surely get me hooked soon since I had been with them for so long. There was a small incident at work and tension was high enough that it pushed me over the edge and I finally stopped. Sure, it was not the smartest thing to do, as I did not get another job, but I worked for Depot until I literally could not stand it for a moment longer. It turned out to be a blessing in disguise. I started distributing my resume and applications to many different places, but after talking to the management, it did not seem too good for either of them. After about a month without work, I was a day away from pizza hut because I knew they needed drivers. I was happy and got a call from a security company I applied for. They wanted to hire me to work a temporary job for a power station while it was in an interruption phase. The good news was that I get more than 60 hours a week at a good pay rate. My first salary was 3-4 times I made at an office depot in a whole month. They are doing so well that they decided to keep me and offered me a permanent job.

Little things occurred after labor and strife were deep enough, which pushed me to the brink and I ceased to retire. Sure, it wasn't the smartest thing considering I didn't find another job, but I worked for Depot literally until I couldn't bear it at the moment. It turned out to be a blessing in disguise. I started to expand my resume and applications to various sites, but after I talked to the management, it was very helpful to find out none of them. After about a month of work I worked out the day that I was going to a pizza hut because I knew drivers would need it. I am lucky and got a call from the security company I applied for. They wanted to hire me for a temp job working at a power plant while I was in the bus phase. The good news has been that I am getting 60+ hours a week for good pay. My first paycheck was 3-4 times what I did in a whole month at the service depot. Things were so good with them that they determined to save me and afforded me a perpetual duty.
0	I spent 5 years at Office Depot as a part-time employee. The first 2 years were fine for me because I still went to school and part time was all I could handle. After I left school, I told them I wanted a full-time job. The manager said there was no one available at the time, but he would take care of me and promised that I could get one after it became available. Cut to 3 years later and I still worked part time there. Looking back, I should have left MUCH earlier than I did. I had applied for a few jobs during these 3 years, but I had never seriously applied for better employment, and thought that Office Depot would probably hook me up soon since I had been with them for so long. It was a small incident at work and the tension was high enough that it pushed me over the edge and I ended up quitting. Sure, it was not the smartest thing to do considering I had not found another job, but I worked for Depot until I literally could not stand another moment. It turned out to be a blessing in disguise. I started spreading my CV and my applications to many different places, but after talking to the management it did not look good for any of them. After about a month without a job, I was one day away from going to the pizza hut because I knew they needed drivers. I was lucky and got a call from a security company I had applied to. They wanted to hire me to work a temporary job for a power plant while it was down. The good news was that I got 60+ hours a week at a good pay rate. My first paycheck was 3-4 times what I had earned in a full month at the office depot. It has gone so well with them that they decided to keep me and offered me a permanent job.

1	The more games you play, then the volatility of bad teammates or even good teammates (luck of the draw) approaches zero and your skill will be the determining factor that shines through. It's the same with poker and even sports. Would you rather go to a game after 21 with a professional basketball player for $ 100,000 or just 1 point? Of course the 1 point, because anything can happen in one point. So if you play enough games, such things become trivial and you will come through bronze because you are a good enough player, not because you are worn out or you can not make it because of silver V trolls.

Obviously 1 point, because anything can happen at one point.

Obviously 1 point because anything can happen at one point. So if you play enough games, things like that become trivial and you’ll go through bronze because you’re a good enough player, not because it carries you or you can’t succeed because of the silver V trolls.
1	The more games you play, the closer your bad teammates and good teammates (draw luck) will be to zero, and your skills will be a brilliant determinant. The same is true for poker and sports.

Pass through.

The same applies to poker and even sports. Would you rather go to game 21 with a pro basketball player for $100,000 or only 1 point? It is therefore clear that point 1 can happen in one point. So if you play enough games then stuff like that becomes trivial and you'll have enough money because you're not a good enough player either because you can't reach it or because of the 5 trolls you can't do that for silver.

Obviously 1 point if anything can happen in one step. So if you play enough games then things like this get smaller and you will go through the copper because you are a good enough player not because you are carried or you can't come because of the V-money cash trolleys.
1	If you play a lot of games it means the difference between having bad partners or good partners (lucky luck) gets closer to the egg and your ability will be the deciding factor that will stand out. It is the same with poker and even sports. Would you like to go to a game of 21 with a professional basketball player for $ 100,000 or just 1 point? Obviously point 1 as anything can happen with one point. So if you play enough games things like this become a small thing and you will pass the brass because you are a good enough player and not because you carry too much weight or you cannot win because of the V Vs troll.
1	Yes, there is already a solution to this problem. THE TRIBUNAL. It is very rare for someone to be banned enough from bad games to penetrate the tribunal and even more rare for the tribunal to ban them. Keep in mind the people in the tribunal are the bottom like 10% of the players, so since “everyone” reports feeding games, it becomes equal and not many of those feeders make it down there. And to those who do, I have found that the tribunal is generally fairly fair in its decision-making. They are not going to report someone just because they were negative, but rather look at talking and building.
1	Yes, this problem already has a solution. court. Few people are banned from court for bad games, and it's even rarer for courts to ban them. Keep in mind that the people in the courtroom are like the bottom 10% of players, so "everyone" is reporting a flattening out of the feeding game, and not many of these feeders do. For those who do, I find the courts are generally fairly fair in their decisions. They don't report someone just because they are negative, but look at chat and builds.
1	Yes, there is already a solution to this problem. THE TRIBUNAL. It's very rare for someone to be banned from bad games enough to make it to court and even rarer for the court to ban it. Keep in mind that court members are at the bottom like 10% of players, so "everyone" reports that feeder games balance out and few of these feeders get there. And for those that do, I've found that the court is usually pretty fair in their decision-making. They're not going to report someone just because they've gone negative, but rather watch the chat and build.
1	Yes, there is already a solution to this problem. TRIBUNAL. It is very rare for anyone to get enough of a ban on playing bad games to get to court, and it is still rare for a court to ban it. Keep in mind that people at the Tribunal are at the bottom as 10% of the players, so as “everyone” reports feeding games, that equals and few of those breadwinners thrive down there. And to those who do, I’ve found that the tribunal is generally fairly honest in its decision-making. He will not report someone just because he was negative, but he will rather watch the chat and build.
1	Yes, there is already a solution to this problem. Tribunal. It is very rare that everyone is banned enough to go to court from a bad game, and it is even rarer for the court to ban them. Keep in mind that "everyone" reports feeding games evenly, and many of those feeders don't get there, as court people are at the bottom, like 10% of players. And for those who do, I have found that courts are generally fairly fair in their decisions. Instead of reporting someone just because they're negative, we'll look at chats and builds.
1	Yes, there is already a solution to this problem. THE CHAIRMAN It is very rare for someone to release a tribunal to a tribunal, and much more rarely to prohibit a person from bad sports. Keep in mind that there are almost 10% of players on the bottom platform, as it turns out to be "all" feeding games, and not many of the ones who feed it do it. And for those who do, I found the tribunal to be quite fair in their decision. Don't just tell someone that they started out as negative, but rather see, chat and build.

They are not going to report anyone just because they became negative, but rather look at chat and build.
1	Yes, there is already a solution for this problem. THE COURT. It's very rare that someone gets banned enough bad games to make it to court and even rarer that they get banned by the court. Keep in mind that the people on the court are the bottom 10% of the players, so "everyone" reports that the feed games are even and not many of those feeders make it there. And for those that do, I have found that the court is generally quite fair in its decision making. They're not going to report someone just because they went negative, they're going to look at the chat and build.
1	Yes, there is already a solution to this problem. COURTS. It is very rare for anyone to be banned enough from bad sports to come to that court and even rarely do the court ban them. Keep in mind that the people on the court are as low as 10% of the players so "everyone" reports feeding games becomes the same and not many of those donors do. And for those who do, I have found the court as a whole to be fair in their decisions. They will not report anyone just because he went negative but watch the conversation and build.
1	Yes, there is already a solution to this problem. COURT. It is not uncommon for anyone to be severely restricted from bad sports in order to appear before a tribunal and even less so in court. Keep in mind that the people in the tribunal are as low as 10% of the players so "everyone" reports feed games out and not many of those feeders are doing it down there. And for those who do, I find that the tribunal is often unfair in making decisions. They will not report the person just because it did not go well but instead look at the conversation and build.

0	Not crazy. Absolutely not. I grew up in rural Iowa and gun safety was taught in-house. I was not allowed as a small child to even aim toy guns at people and was taught the safety rules for firearms before I was ten. I have noticed many "city" people in this country have absolutely no exposure to responsible gun culture. Their only experience with firearms is the violence they see on TV. So I do not think you're crazy to think someone needs formal training to own a firearm. We are crazy as a society because we think the right to bear arms can be separated from the responsibility of ensuring that every citizen understands the basic safety rules of firearms handling.

I've noticed that a lot of "urban" people in this country have absolutely no exposure to responsible gun culture. Their only experience with guns is the violence they see on TV.

0	Not crazy. Absolutely not. I grew up in rural Iowa and gun safety was taught at home. When I was little, I wasn't even allowed to point guns at people, and I learned the rules of gun safety before I was ten years old.

0	It's not crazy. Absolutely not. I grew up in rural Iowa and at home they learned gun safety. I was not allowed to point even toy guns at people as a small child, and they taught me the safety rules for firearms ten years ago.

0	Not crazy. Absolutely not. I grew up in the countryside of Iowa and the safety of guns was taught at home. When I was young, even toy guns weren't allowed to point at people, and I was taught firearm safety rules before I was ten years old. I have noticed that many "city" people in this country are not exposed to responsible gun culture at all. Their only experience with firearms is the violence they see on television. So I don't think anyone is obsessed with thinking that formal training is needed to own a firearm. We are obsessed with the society that believes that the right to arm can be separated from the responsibility of ensuring that all citizens understand the basic safety rules regarding the handling of firearms.
0	You are not crazy. Not absolutely. I grew up in rural Iowa and was trained in gun safety at home. I was not allowed to even show little kids toy guns and teach gun safety rules before I was ten. I have noticed that a lot of people in this country have absolutely no explanation for those responsible for gun culture. Along with the gun experience is the violence that you see on TV. Therefore I don't think you're crazy if someone thinks that there is need for some reason to possess a firearm. It is crazy for a society to think that a divorce can be a right to bear arms, so that each citizen understands the basic safety norms for gun handling.

Do not play team games if you like that kind of play - go "fun" in FPS or RTS games, where you can play 1v1, and where you want to lose intentionally, because you "feel" like to play that champion and there is a 99% chance of being released, you can lose without offending others.
1	I agree that people should be allowed to play what they want, but at least be competent, if you want to pick with shit champions, go do practices or clash, in normal you should at least be content with the champion you want to play , or else you just bring down the experience of the other people in your team. Despite that, people are sometimes just tools, I was just in a game where I duoed with someone, and a few other guys duoed too, and they wanted to double the jungle, did not want to listen to me when I did it for them saying was not a bad idea (three solos, less xp, etc, etc.). And finally they only switched when I told them I was staying in a duo (I was already thirsty) so unless they wanted to leave the whole game open at the top they would switch. Either way, they blamed me for every little thing and would not participate in team fights the entire game. So yes.
1	I agree that people should be allowed to play what they want, but at least have the ability, if you want to play with crappy heroes, go customs or bots, in normal circumstances you should at least have enough ability to play The hero you want to play, otherwise you're just lowering the experience of the rest of the team. Still, sometimes people are just tools and I'm just in a game where I'm in duo with someone and some other guys are in duo and they want duo junglers and they don't listen to me when I tell them it's a duo Bad idea (three solos, less experience, etc). Eventually they only switch when I tell them I'm staying in the duo (I have thresh locked) so unless they want to keep the top open for all games, they switch. They blame me for every little thing anyway and don't go into teamfights at all games. yes.
1	I agree that people should be allowed to play whatever they want but at least be competent if you want to play shitty champions go do customs or bots in normal you should at least be adequate with the champion you want to play, or you're just reducing the experience of other members of your team. Despite that, sometimes people are just tools, I was just in a game where I was queuing with someone, and other guys were queuing too, and they wanted to double jungle, they didn't bother me. didn't listen when I told them was a bad idea (three solos, less xp, etc etc). And finally they only changed when I told them I was staying in duo (I had already locked the thresh) so unless they wanted to leave the top open the whole game they would change. Anyway, they blamed me for every little thing and wouldn't participate in team fights for the whole game. So here is.
1	I agree that people should be allowed to play what they want, but at least be competent, if you want to mess with shitty champions, go to customs or bots, in normal conditions at least you should be adequate with the champion you want to play, or just diminish the experience of others people on your team. Despite that, sometimes people are just tools, I was just in a game where I was hanging out with someone, and some other guys were hanging out and wanted to double the jungle, they didn’t listen to me when I told them it was a bad idea (three solos , less xp, etc.). And in the end they switched only when I told them to stay in the duo (I already locked in the thresh) so they would switch unless they want to leave the top open the whole game. No matter what, they blamed me for every little thing and didn’t want to get involved in team fights the whole game. Well yes.
1	I agree that people should be allowed to play what they want, but if you want to play with a silly champion, customs or bot, usually the champion you want to play Should be at least sufficient, or else it's just diminishing the experience of the rest of the team. Nevertheless, sometimes people are just tools, I'm in a game duo cuing a bot with someone, some other guys are also duo queuing and they want to double the jungle I thought, it was a bad idea that I didn't listen to me when I told them (3 solos, less xp, etc.). And finally they switched only when I told them I was staying in the duo (I was already trapped in the threshold) so unless they didn't want to keep the top open , They switch. Anyway, they blamed me for all the little things and didn't participate in Team Fight in every game. Yes Yes.
1	I agree that it may be possible for people to do whatever they want, but at least if you want to be fit to spread crappy boxers, do lower or lower routines, at least be pretty normal with the champion you want to play. or the experience of other people on the team. Although sometimes people are only instruments in a game where I was duoqueuing with some bot, and some other latina were still duoqueuing, and they wanted to duplicate the woody, they didn't want me to hear them when I was talking. It was a bad idea (only three, less xp, etc.). In the end, I just switched on them when I told them to stay on for two more (I had a tread lock already) so that if they wanted to leave all game open at the top, they should switch. Nevertheless, they criticized me in every single episode, and refused to play in the contests. Yes I remember.
1	I agree that people should be allowed to play what they want, but at least be competent, if you want to joke with stubborn champions, go and make customs or robots, in normal you should at least be sufficient with the master you will play, otherwise you just take down the experience of the other people on your team. Despite that, sometimes people are just tools, I was just in a game where I duo meat fine with someone, and some other boys duo meat too, and they wanted to double the jungle, would not listen to me when I told them it was a bad idea (three solos, less xp, etc etc). And in the end, they only switched when I told them I was living in a duo (I had already locked the threshing floor) so unless they wanted to leave the top open the whole game, they would switch. Anyway, they blamed me for every little thing, and would not be in team matches the whole match. So yes.

Despite that, sometimes people are just tools, I was just in a game where I was bot-queuing someone, and other guys were queuing too, and they wanted to double jungle, they didn't listen to me when I told them . it was a bad idea (three solos, less xp, etc etc). And finally, they only changed when I told them I'd stay in a duo (I had already locked Thresh), so unless they wanted to leave the top open the whole game, they'd change. Anyway, they blamed me for every little thing and didn't join in team fights for the entire game. So yes.
1	I agree that people should be allowed to play as they please, but at least be able to, if you want to interact with the champions, go and do the customs or robots, usually you must at least be fit with the champion you want to play. , or else you just undermine the experience of other people on your team. Despite this, sometimes people are just tools, I was just in a game where I was playing robots with someone, and some people were queuing up too, and they wanted to climb the forest twice, they didn't listen to me when I told them. it was a bad idea (three solo, a little xp, etc.). And in the end they just changed when I told them I was sitting on two people (I was already locked in the palm of the hand) so unless they wanted to leave the game open they would all change. Regardless, they blamed me for every little thing, and they would not join the team game all game. So yes.
1	I agree that people should be allowed to play what they want, but at least be skilled, if you want to roam with a crappy champion, go and do rituals or bots, usually you should at least have enough with the champion you want to play. , or simply downgrade other people in your group. Despite that, sometimes people are just tools, I was in a game where I was playing bot with someone, and some guys were going duoqueueing again, and they wanted to double the jungle, they didn’t want to listen to me when I told them. it was a bad idea (three solos, small xps, etc. etc). And in the end they only changed when I told them I was living in a duo (I was locked up in thresh) so unless they wanted to leave the top open the whole game would change. In any case, they blamed me for everything, and they would not take part in a team fight every game. So yes.
1	The main reason why Amumu (and similar champions)'s face roll is bronze is that no one knows how to recognize anything but the most difficult initiations.

1	Honestly, there is no such thing as a 'troll-pick'. What many, if not most of the League of Legends community do is follow the meta; most players play with the established conventional playing styles (e.g. 1, 1, 2 lanes, 2v1 lanes). What most people do not realize is that the meta is not written in stone; there is no fixed way to play this game. Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but the meta is just designed to give you the best chance of winning the game. And the meta changes. If people are furious / flaming you for choosing a bruiser bot lane, remember that some (I can not remember who) pro players predicted bruiser bot lanes in the preseason of Season 3. The OP is right, LoL is a game (of course) and it's a sandbox type game, albeit 3 ​​cards and limited options. Sandbox means that everything you do in the game is completely in order. However, this is only in the perspective of yourself. This game is a team game, so your game should try to integrate with others'. But that is my own humble opinion.

1	Honestly, there is no ‘troll-pick’. What many, if not most of the League of Legends community is doing, is to follow the target; most players play with set conventional game styles (e.g. 1, 1, 2 tracks, 2 on 1 tracks).

If people get angry about choosing Bruiser Bot Lane, keep in mind that professional players predicted Bruiser Bot Lane during the pre-season of Season 3. OP is correct. LoL is a game (obviously), a sandbox-type game with three maps and limited options. Sandboxing means that everything you do in the game is perfectly normal. But this is just my point of view.

If people are raging at you with fire at automobile-lane picking, remember that some (I don't remember who) for players brudes bot-balances predicted in pre-season 3. The OP is right, LoL it is. The game (of course) is a sandbox type game, albeit with 3 maps and limited options. The arena-box means everything you do within the game perfectly nicely.

1	When Evelyn just got a remake, everyone complained that she was still terrible. Well, I happened to be watching some LoL tournament where a guy (Shooshie? Shushi? Some chubby white European guy with black hair) claimed she's an amazing drug. Well, he played Eve, and even though his team lost miserably, he consistently did well with her despite the rest of his team being destroyed. So I buy her and try her out. Holy. Kak. She was AMAZING in the middle! Literally every game I bumped. Very easy to play, good farm, good ganks, small learning curve. But every time people threw a shitstorm at me because I was trying to go Eve mid. I'm a troll, I'm an idiot, I'm going to feed her, no you can not pick her, etc. Every game I had a ridiculously good record. Every remedy was won, almost all matches were won because my ganks were so unfair. But every time I played with new people, they gave me the same sadness. So run what the hell you want. 99% of people will assume that X champions are good / bad just based on how often they are played in pro tournaments. However, people do not realize that they are based on team compositions, counter-choices, the meta, etc. choose not, and most of these have little to no value to an average solo player. And sometimes the pros don't realize something is good! Ezreal was untouched for such a year before he was "suddenly" overwhelmed and everyone played him.
1	Back when Evelyn was just redone, everyone was complaining that she was still bad. Well, I happened to watch some League of Legends tournaments and one of them (Shooshie? Shushi? Some chubby brunette white European) claimed she was an amazing mid laner. Well, he plays Eve, and even though his team loses badly, even though the rest of his team is devastated, he's always been decent to her. So I bought her and gave it a try. St. shit. She is amazing in the middle! Literally every game I was stomping my feet. Very easy to get started, good farm, great gank, minimal learning curve. But every time people get mad at me for trying to go to mid-Eve. I'm a troll, I'm an idiot, I'm going to feed, no, you can't pick her, etc. Every game my record is ridiculously good. I won every mid lane, almost every game because my ganks were so unfair. However, every time I play with new friends, they give me the same sadness. So, run as much as you want. 99% would agree that X champs are only as good as how often they play in professional tournaments. What people don't realize, however, is that they are picked based on team lineups, counter-attacks, meta, etc., and most of them have little value to the average solo Q player. Sometimes professionals don't realize that something is good! Ezreal was untouched for about a year before he was "suddenly" overpowered and everyone played him.
1	Back when Evelyn had just been reworked, everyone was complaining that she was still terrible. Well, I happened to watch a LoL tournament where a guy (Shooshie? Shushi? A chubby white European with dark hair) claimed she was an amazing midfielder. Well, he played Eve, and even though his team lost miserably, he still got on well with her despite destroying the rest of his team. So I buy it and try it. Holy. Shit. She was AMAZING in the middle! Literally every game I've walked on. Very easy to play, good firm, great ganks, small learning curve. But every time people would throw a shit storm at me for trying to get in the middle of Eve. I'm a troll, I'm an idiot, I'm going to feed myself, no, you don't have the right to choose her, etc. Every game I had a ridiculously good record. Every midfield was won, almost every game was won because my ganks were so unfair. Yet every time I played with new people, they gave me the same heartbreak. So run as you want. 99% of people will assume Champion X is good/bad just on how often they are played in pro tournaments. People don't realize, however, that they're selecting based on team compositions, counter picks, meta, etc., and most of that is of little to no value to a average solo q player. And sometimes the pros don't realize something is right! Ezreal was untouched for a year before he was "suddenly" subdued and everyone played him.
1	When Evelyn just got the finishing touches, everyone complained that she was still horrible. Well, I happened to watch some LoL tournament where a guy (Shooshie? Shushi? Some chubby white European with black hair) claimed she was amazing us. Well, he played Eve, and although his team lost unhappily, he was consistently polite to her despite the fact that the rest of his team was destroyed. So I buy it and try it out. holy. Shit. She was GREAT in the middle! I trampled on literally every game. Very easy to play, good farm, great porches, small learning curve. But every time people would turn me on because I tried to go to Eve. I’m a troll, I’m an idiot, I’ll feed, no, you can’t pick her, etc. I’ve had a ridiculously good record every game. Every mid was won, almost all the games were won because my porches were so unfair. Yet, every time I played with new people, they would give me the same sadness. So run whatever you want. 99% of people will assume that the X champ is good / bad just by how often they play in professional tournaments. People, however, don’t realize that they are choosing based on teammates, counter peaks, targets, etc., and most of that has little or no value for the average solo q player. And sometimes professionals don’t realize that something is good! Ezreal was intact for a year before it was “suddenly” defeated and everyone played it.
1	Everyone was complaining that she was still terrible when Evelyn had just reworked. Well, I happened to see a guy (Shooshie? Shushi? A chubby white European with black hair) in a LoL tournament claiming she's a great mid. Well, he played Eve, and even if his team lost miserably, he was consistently decent with her, despite the destruction of the rest of his team. So I buy her and give it a try. holy. Shit. She was amazing in the middle! Literally all the games I was trampling on. Very easy to play, good farm, great ganks, small learning curves. But every time people make a fuss about me trying to go to the middle of Eve. I'm a troll, I'm an idiot, I'm going to feed, you're not allowed to choose her, etc. I had a tremendously good record in every game. My gang was so unfair that every mid won, almost every game won. But every time I played with new people, they gave me the same sadness. So do whatever you want. 99% of people think the X Champion is good / bad just by how often they play in pro tournaments. However, people are unaware that they are choosing based on team comps, counter picks, metas, and so on. Most of these are of little or no value to the average solo q player. And sometimes professionals don't realize something is good! Ezreal was "suddenly" overwhelmed and left untouched for about a year before everyone played him.
1	Back when Evelyn just got the rework, they all complained that it was still awesome. Well, it happened to me to watch some LoL tournaments where the guy (Shooshie? Shushi? some chubby white european guy with black hair) claimed to be a strange medium. He played well with Eve, and although his team lost miserably, he did consistently decent with her, not to mention having killed the rest of his team. So I buy it and try it. Holy Shit. It was a surprise in mid! I am literally stomping every game. It's easy to play, good firm, big team, small learning curve. But every time people have thrown me into a shitstorm, Eve is trying to get in the middle. I am a troll, I am a fool, I am going to eat, it's not illegal for you to pick it up. Every game I had a ridiculously good record. All media have been won, and almost all games have been made, because it is so unfair of clowns. However, whenever I play with new people, they will give me the same pain. So run to hell whatever you want. 99% of the men's X champ will take up the good/bad ground in which they are often played in pro tournaments. People don't know yet that they will be picking on buttons, counters, meta, etc. Sometimes the pros don't notice anything good! Ezreal was spelled like a year ago "suddenly" and everyone played him.

I'm a troll, I'm an idiot, I'm going to feed, no you're not allowed to pick her, etc. Every fight I had a ridiculously good record. Every midfield was won, almost every game was won because my ganks were so unfair. But every time I played with new people, they gave me the same grief. So run what you want. 99% of people will assume that X champ is good / bad just because of how often they are played in professional tournaments. However, people do not realize that they choose based on team comps, counter-choices, meta, etc., and most of this has little or no value for an average solo player. And sometimes the pros do not realize that something is good! Ezreal was untouched for a year before he was "suddenly" overpowered and everyone played him.
1	Before, when Evelyn had just returned to work, everyone complained that it was still terrible. Well, I saw a LoL tournament where a guy (Shooshie? Shushi? Chubby white European with black hair) claimed that she was an amazing average. Well, he played Eve, and even though her team lost miserably, he always did decently with her even though the rest of her team was destroyed. So I buy it and try it. Holy. Shit. She was AMAZING at half! Literally every game she was stomping on. Very easy to play, good farm, great ganks, little learning curve. But every time people would throw a shitstorm at me for trying to go halfway through Eve. I'm a troll, I'm an idiot, I'm going to feed, no, you can't choose her, etc. In every game I had a ridiculously good record. Every half was won, almost every game was won because my ambushes were so unfair. However, every time I played with new people, they gave me the same pain. So run what you want. 99% of people will assume Champion X is good/bad just because of how often he is played in pro tournaments. However, people don't realize that they're making choices based on team compositions, counter attacks, meta, etc., and most of this has little to no value to the average solo q player. And sometimes professionals do not realize that something is good! Ezreal was untouched for a year before he was "suddenly" mastered and everyone played with him.
1	Back then when Evelyn got a job again everyone was complaining that she was still bad. Actually, I happened to watch a LoL contest where a boy (Shooshie? Shushi? A black European man with black hair) was claiming to be a very strange man. True, he played Eve, and although his team lost badly, he did well with him despite his entire team being ruined. So I buy him and try him out. Holy. Shit. He was AMAZING in the middle! In fact every game I was stepping on. Very easy to play, nice field, big gangs, small stream of learning. But every time people would throw a storm at me, they would try to get Eve to the center. I am a troll, I am a fool, I am going to feed, no you are not allowed to take him, etc. Every game I had a good ridiculous record. Every middle one won, almost all the games won because my joints were not fair. Still every time I played with new people it gave me the same sadness. So run whatever the hell you want. 99% of people will think X champion is just good / bad due to the times they are played in professional competitions. People do not realize, however, that they choose according to team comps, counterpick, meta, n.k, and much of this has no value to the average player q q. And sometimes the benefits don't realize a good thing! Ezreal was not touched as a year before he was "suddenly" overwhelmed and everyone played with him.
1	Back when Evelyn had just got a new job everyone was complaining that she was still ugly. Well, I've watched a LoL contest where a boy (Shooshie? Shushi? A burly European man with dark hair) claimed to be in the middle of nowhere. However, he played Eve, and even though his team lost badly, he still did well for her despite the fact that his entire team was destroyed. So I buy him and try him. Holy. Shit. AWESOME in the middle! In fact, every game I played was a step in the right direction. Very easy to play, nice farm, nice ganks, small learning curve. But all the time people were throwing me in the storm trying to walk with Eve in the middle. I am a troll, I am stupid, I will eat, no you are not allowed to choose him, etc. Every game I had a good record in a funny way. Every time it was won, almost every game was won because my ganks were unfair. Yet every time I played with young people they gave me the same misery. So run whatever the hell you want. 99% of people will think X Champ is only good / bad by how often he is played in professional competitions. People do not realize, however, that they choose based on team comps, counterpicks, meta, etc., and many of these have little or no value for one midfielder. And sometimes experts do not see the point! Ezreal was not touched for a year before he was "suddenly" defeated by everyone and played.
1	He did not just bring it up again after promising for years that he would not.

1	He did not simply return it after years of promising. In doing so, he completely removed the website / forums that contain private developer for heroes and stuff.

1	it's hilarious bc i just played a game where i did not ban malphite bc everyone knows there is much higher priority ban. So these old flames that I did not ban malfiet, and then choose zed instead of an ap champ. then he continues to die of malphite and this is malph's only two deaths in the entire match. meanwhile I go 8-2 as graves and rape malphite and the rest of his team. at the end of the game zed says he was the best in our team and hope i learn to ban malphite bc he is so up.
1	It's funny because I just played a game where I didn't ban Malphite because everyone knows there are higher priority bans. So the guy was pissed that I didn't ban Murphy and chose zed instead of ap champ. He then went on to die by malphite, which was Malph's only two kills in the entire game. Meanwhile, I took 8-2 as a grave and raped malphite and the rest of his team. At the end of the game, zed said he was the best on our team and hopefully I can learn to disable malphite because he is awesome.

So this guy claims I didn't ban malphite and then chooses zed instead of ap champ. then he continues to die a malphite and these are just two of Malph's murders throughout the game. meanwhile I go 8-2 like Graves and rape Malfit and the rest of his team. at the end of the game zed says he was the best on our team and he hopes i will learn to ban malphite bc he is so op.
1	It's a hilarious bc. I just played a game that didn't ban Malphite. bc Everyone knows that there is a much higher priority ban. So this guy burns up saying I didn't ban Malphite and chooses zed instead of the ap champion. Then he dies to Malphite, and they are the killings of only two Malphs throughout the game. Meanwhile, I go to 8-2 as a grave and rape Malphite and other members of his team. At the end of the game, zed says he was the best on our team and hopes I'll learn to ban Malphite bc.
1	This is hilarious bc i just played a game where malphite didn't move right bc we all know there are much higher bans. To this man, therefore, the flames which did not move from Malphite, and then he plucked it from the champo. then he proceeds to die Malphitus, and only those two Malphius are killed in the whole game. meanwhile like the sepulchres and the abduction of Malphite and the rest of his company. At the end of the game Zed says that he is the best in our team and hopes we learn that Malphite BC Banni is so op.
1	it's fun bc. I just played a game where I did not ban malphite, straight bc. Everyone knows that there are much higher priority bans. So this guy flames that I did not ban malphite, and then choose zed instead of a monkey master. then he continues to die to malphite and it is malphs only two kills in the whole game. meanwhile I go 8-2 digging and raping malfit and the rest of his team. at the end of the game zed says he was the best on our team and hope i learn to ban malphite bc he is so up.
1	that's hilarious because i just played a game where i didn't ban malphite because everyone knows there are much higher priority bans. So this guy complains that I didn't ban malphite, then picks zed instead of an ap champion. He then proceeds to die to Malphite and those are the only two Malph kills in the entire game. meanwhile i go 8-2 like graves and rape malphite and the rest of his team. At the end of the game, Zed says that he was the best on our team and hopes that he learns to ban Malphite because he's too operative.
1	that is funny bc i played a game where i did not ban malphite right bc everyone knows there is a ban of higher priority. So this guy is on fire that I did not ban malphite, then he chooses zed instead of ap champ. then he goes on to die of malphite and those are just two murders of malph in the whole game. meanwhile I go 8-2 as a cemetery and rape Malphite and the rest of her team. at the end of the game zed says he was the best on our team and hopes i will learn to ban malphite bc he's so op.
1	It's funny that bc I just played a game where I didn't block the malphite well bc everyone knows that there is a very high block important. So this guy is on fire that I did not block the malphite, then choose a zed instead of an ap champ. Then he goes on to die in the malphite and those are only two malphic killers in the whole game. I am currently going 8-2 as a cemetery and raping the malphite and his entire team. at the end of the game Zed says he was the best in our team and hopes I will learn to prevent malphite bc he's op.
1	It's a bit human nature because people are cramped. Most people, especially at lower ELOs, tend to copy only things they have seen on stream and have a fairly straightforward mindset, telling what is good and what is bad, how to play. Those people tend not to accept other opinions that are outside the general consensus. If you take a closer look, you will see it in Real Life as well. Especially when it comes to LoL in my opinion there are no such things as Troll-Picks, of course there are things that will not work (e.g. if you try to play Karthus as an AD Carry), but even those very niche things can work if you catch enemies from waiting. Most people can only accept something strange, which has not yet been completely proven, because it's just easier to stick to the usual stuff. Also, people who get angry about weird choices or even bans (which Amumu leaves open for example) will lose a lot more games than if they would just assume that someone wants to play something weird and probably even know what they are doing or just try something completely new. Best example of this for me is Support Elise, because hands down after Elise's release, people would have raged if you picked her up as Support and these days you see her at a very high level.
1	It's kind of human, because people are narrow-minded. Most people, especially those on low ELO tend to just copy what they see on stream and have a very straight forward mindset that tells you what's good and what's bad and how you have to Play. Those people tend not to accept other opinions beyond the general consensus. If you look closely, you will see this in real life too. Regarding LoL in particular, I don't think there is such a thing as Troll-Picks, of course some things just won't work (eg if you try to use Karthus as AD Carry), but if you catch enemies, even those very niche Something might also work for guards. Most people just can't take the weird, it's unproven because it's easier to stick to the usual. Also, for people who rave about odd Picks or even Bans (like leaving Amumu open), if they just accept that someone wants to play something weird, maybe even know what they're doing or just try something completely new, they lose more games. The best example for me is supporting Elise, because after Elise was released, people would get mad if you picked her up as a support, and now you see her in a very high place.
1	It's kind of human nature, because humans are narrow-minded. Most people, especially on lower ELOs, tend to just copy things they've seen on stream and have a pretty straightforward mindset, saying what's good and what's bad, how you have to play. These people tend not to accept other opinions that are outside the general consensus. If you take a closer look, you will also see it in real life. Especially when it comes to LoL, in my opinion there are no such things as Troll-Picks, of course there are things that won't work (eg if you try to play Karthus as AD Carry), but even those very niche things could work if you catch guard enemies.

Also, people who rage about weird choices or even bans (leaving Amumu open for example) will lose a lot more games than if they just accept that someone wants to play something weird and knows probably even that he's just doing or trying something entirely new. The best example for me is Support Elise because after Elise was released people would be furious if you chose her as support and these days you see her at a very high level.
1	This is a bit of human nature, because people are narrow-minded. Most people, especially on lower ELOs, tend to just copy things they’ve seen on the stream and have a pretty direct mindset, which says what’s good and what’s bad, how you have to play. These people usually do not accept other opinions that are beyond general agreement. If you take a closer look, you will see it in real life. Especially when it comes to LoL, in my opinion, there are no such things as Troll-Picks, of course there are things that won’t work (e.g. if you try to play Karthus as AD Carry), but even those very low things can function if you catch enemies from the guard. Most people just can’t accept something weird, which isn’t quite proven yet, because it’s just easier to stick to the usual things. Also people who rage about odd choices or even bans (for example, leaving Amum open) will lose a lot more games than if they simply accept that someone wants to play something weird and probably even know what they are doing or just try something completely new. The best example of this for me is Support Elise because people would be furious after releasing Elise to pick her up as support, and today you see her at a really high level.
1	This is a bit of a human nature, as humans are narrow. Most people, especially with low ELO, tend to copy what they see in the stream and have a fairly straightforward mindset. This shows what is good, what is bad, and how you need to play. Those people tend not to accept other opinions that deviate from the general meaning. If you look closely, you can see it in real life. Especially when it comes to LoL, in my opinion, there is no such thing as Troll-Picks. Of course, some don't work (for example, if you try to play Kartus as an AD carry), but if you catch an enemy, even those very niche ones can work. Of the guards. Most people can't accept strange things. It has not been proven yet. Because it's easy to stick to the usual ones. Also, people who get angry about strange picks and bans (for example, keeping Amumu open) accept that someone wants to do something strange and probably know what they're doing. Or you lose far more games than if you were trying something entirely new. The best example of this for me is Support Elise. Because the hands-down after the release of Elise was furious when she was greeted as a support, and nowadays she sees her at a very high nibaud.
1	This is a bit of human nature, because people are wise to block out. Most people, especially in lower ELOs, tend to be just an example of the things they've seen in the stream and have a pretty straightforward mindset that tells good and bad things about how to play. These people are not wont to accept other opinions which are by common consent. If you look closely, then you will see even in real life. Especially around LoL in my opinion there are no such things as a Troll, of course there are things that tend to work (e.g. if you are trying to play Karthus as an AD Carry), but even the angle of things work if you catch the enemy. for guarding. Most people just can't get anything odd, which, however, is not proven enough, because its just material sticks more easily than usual. Even raging people with Odd Picks or even Bans (for example, leaving Amumu open) will pay a lot more games than if they only accept that someone wants to play something odd and may even know what to do or just haul something new at all. The best example of this for me is Elise's support and hands-down after letting people vent to Elise if you picked her up as Maintenance and now she's in a really deep snow.

Also people who rage about different choices or even bans (for example leaving Amumu open) will lose a lot more games than if they would just accept that someone wants to play something weird and probably even know what they are doing or just trying something completely new. The best example of this for me is Support Elise, because people would have raged after the release of Elise if you brought her as Support and today you see her at a very high level.

1	This is a bit of human nature, because human beings are narrow in mind. Most people, especially in low ELOs, simply copy the things they saw on the stream and have the same thoughts, which tell you what is good and bad, how you should play.

Most people will not accept something unusual, which has not yet been proven, because it is easy to cling to ordinary things. Also people who are angry at Extraordinary Options or even Prohibition (leaving Amumu open for example) will lose a lot more games than if they just accepted that someone wants to play something unusual and maybe even know what he is doing or trying something completely new. The best example for this for me is Support Elise because hands down after Elise's release people would be angry if you took her as Support and these days you see her in a very high profile.
1	This is part of human nature, because humans are less intelligent. Most people, especially in the lower ELO, tend to simply copy what they see in the broadcast and have a clear mind, telling the good and the bad, how to play. Such people are inclined to disagree with ideas that are out of the ordinary. If you look closely you will see that in Real Life aswell. Especially with regard to LoL in my opinion there are no such things as Troll-Picks, of course there are things that do not work (e.g. security guards. -Amumu is open for example) they will lose a lot more games than they just accept that someone wants to play something weird and maybe even know what they are doing or trying something completely new. A good example for me is Support Elise because going down after Elise's release like Support and these days you see him at a very high level.
1	Normally you can play whatever you want, but in the rankings you should not choose that shaco fp 'or him in their tanky / aoe team.

1	You can usually play as you like, but if you're ranked, you shouldn't fp the mantis shrimp or choose it for the Tanky / Aoe team.

1	In normal you can play whatever you want, but in a better level you can't be fp'ing and shaco or picking it up on a cinema/aoe team.

1	At normal levels you can play whatever you want but in space it is best not to have a shaco or take him to their tanky / aoe team. That is the same as intentional feeding as your choice has made each team fight 4v5.

1	LP profits are based on the MMR (elo) distance to the next promotion series. Player 1 @ Silver 1 has 1600 MMR, 70 LP. Player 2 @ Silver 1 has 1500 MMR, 90 LP. Gold 5 is 1550 MMR. Player 1 wins a match and wins 30 LP -> enters series. He already had the MMR needed for promotion series, so the system really wants him there. Player 2 wins a match and wins 3 LP, is now at 1515 MMR of the 1550 needed for series. Distance to range 35 MMR, but only 7 LP. Next games will be worth about the same 3 LP for wins. Losses can be like -15 LP, but that does not mean much. The weak LP gains as player 2 has are common in division 1 of any league. This is because the MMR distance between leagues is greater than the distance between divisions within the league. I just think at Diamond 1 the LPs really show the distance to promotional series.

Next game will be valid for around the same 3 LP for the leagues. The damage is like -15 LP, but it doesn't mean much. Weak LP acquires as a player 2 common divisions in each league. This means that the MMR distance of leagues is greater than the distance between divisions within the league.

As a person like OP, when I socialize with others, I will probably feel apathetic about everything they have to say, but I will emulate enthusiasm / interest / contempt / etc. for you know, fit in or whatever. Now I know that everyone does this to some degree, but in my experience it has come to a point that I do this with everyone all the time, even my family.I have enjoyed it among many different cliques and social groups, but I do not feel close to anyone really.All interests I have developed over the years have been tailored to impress others, every mannerism is artificial and changeable. Being a good liar really helps this too.

0	It's extremely difficult to "be yourself" in situations and social groups that do not involve you. You may notice that the people who are very loud and unpleasant seem to all flock to them, but this is mainly because they basically throw their arms in the air and expose their personality to anyone who is willing to listen. It gives most people the kind of icebreaker he / she needs to find someone to dress up for: loud person (let's call this person Bill for the sake of simplicity) Bill appreciates the quiet person Sue (again just for simplicity) for Sue is willing to listen and empathize with Bill; Sue appreciates Bill because Bill fills the void, makes the jokes laugh when Sue occasionally makes a joke and is generally good company. Although it works, if Bill remains this fool who keeps the spotlight firmly on himself and does not try to enter into a conversation with Sue, then Sue will develop this hollow feeling because Bill does not allow her to express herself and it will look like any remark Bill says, Sue agrees because Sue will not show any form of expression other than embarrassment. Meanwhile, Sue can not just leave Bill to involve her, as it forces Bill to tackle an issue that is not brought to his attention, and denies it makes it MINIMUM three times worse. Marigolds should also express their opinion, because to complain that no one involves them simply raises the question of why they did not engage others: the answers will be strikingly the same. This example happens in many different aspects, even family. A way to combat this tense nature: Sue invites Bill to things about as often as Bill invites Sue. By making Bill the guest and Sue the host, it gives Sue this established presence that she is the host, who welcomes Bill into her life, it gives Bill a chance to meet on Sue's terms instead of the other way around.

0	I think this is a good idea. After my last big break, I was in a borderline depressive state for months until I got my first dog. Although I recommend adopting one that is at least a year or two old, possibly older. That way, you're past the shit all over the house phase and more likely past destroying all your shoes / furniture phase. Dogs are definitely a responsibility and in many respects they seem to have a human child, so get any big trip out of the way first.
0	I think it's a good idea. After my last major breakup, I was on the brink of depression for months until I got my first dog. Although I do recommend taking at least one or two years old, possibly older. This way you've gone through the entire house phase, more likely past the destroying all shoes/furniture phase. Dogs are definitely a liability, similar in many ways to having a human child, so keep any big trips away in the first place.

0	I think it's a great idea. After my last big split, I was in a borderline depressed state for months before I had my first dog. We recommend that you use one that is at least a year or two, and perhaps older. That way, you're more likely to pass shit through the entire phase of the house and destroy all phases of shoes and furniture. Dogs are definitely responsible and in many ways are similar to having a human child, so don't disturb a big trip first.
0	I think it's a great idea. After my last major disintegration, I was in a borderline depressed state for months until I got my first dog. Although I recommend that they be at least one year or two, perhaps older. In this way, besides the shit all over the house, it will destroy the Passover and more likely save the entire shoe/row season. Dogs are a real responsibility and in many respects similar to a human infant, so that they can catch any big ones on the road.
0	I think that's a good idea. After my last major breakup, I was in a depressed state for several months until I got my first dog. Although I recommend adopting someone who is at least one or two years old, possibly older.

Dogs are definitely a responsibility and in many respects it is similar to having a human child, so get some great trips out of the way first.

Although I recommend adopting one that is at least a year or two old, possibly more. That way, you'll be past the phase of shitting all over the house and probably past the phase of destroying all your shoes/furniture. Dogs are definitely a liability and in many ways are similar to having a human child, so eliminate any big trips first.
0	I think it's a good idea. After my last divorce, I was in a state of borderline depression for several months until I got my first dog. Although I recommend passing one that is one or two years old, preferably more. That way you go through all the stages in the house phase and you are more likely to go through the phase of destroying all your shoes / furniture. Dogs are certainly responsible and in many respects resemble having a human child, so get any great ride from the first route.
0	I think that's a good idea. After my last big breakup, I was in a state of depression at the border for months until I found my first dog. Although I recommend taking one or a year old, which is probably too old. That way you have gone through all the rubbish in the house and you may have gone through the process of destroying your shoes / furniture. Dogs are responsible and in many respects are like having a human baby, so get rid of any big walk on the road first.
0	That sounds scary familiar, shit. I saw how all this girl's friends left her while she was playing the victim, acted as if it was their fault that she could not keep any friends, that she was the unhappy soul in it all. We were friends for years, even went out for a while, made out on good terms, remained close friends. I did not realize how badly she treated me. One summer she started talking about how much she hated her current boyfriend, how she was irritated about how much he tried to contact her (they were away from university that summer and could not see each other). She ignored his calls and bit me the whole time. This guy was the closest friend she's had since me, he was a total doormat. When school started again, she was suddenly buddy-buddy with him again, because he was the only person who would tolerate her shit. I began to realize all of her closest friends have the personality type that rolls around and takes shit without fighting back, and realizes it includes me. A few months later, she bothered me about all her new colleagues disagreeing with her about the smallest things and talking about how they started leaving her. To end it was the most liberating thing. I tried really hard to avoid it, to make her understand, but an emotional manipulator will always be one. There's a fucking reason why no one else will stay with her friends.
0	This sounds familiar, shit. I watched all of this girl's friends abandon her while she played the victim, acting like it was their fault, she couldn't keep any friends, she was the unfortunate soul of it all. We were friends for many years, even dated for a while, got along well after the breakup, and remained close friends. I didn't realize how bad she was to me. One summer, she started talking about how much she hated her current boyfriend, how annoyed she was and how he wanted to contact her (they came home from college for the summer and couldn't meet). She kept ignoring his calls and kept getting mad at me. This guy is her closest friend ever and he's a total doormat. When school reopened, she suddenly befriended him again because he was the only one who could tolerate her shit. I've come to realize that all her closest friends have the personality type to roll over and not fight back, and that includes me. A few months later, she complained to me that all her new college friends disagreed with her on the tiniest of things, and talked about how they were starting to dump her. It's the most liberating thing to end that. I try very hard to avoid it and make her understand, but emotional manipulators will always be one of them. There's a reason no one wants to be friends with her.
0	Sounds awfully familiar, damn it. I saw all of this girl's friends abandon her as she played the victim, acted like it was their fault that she couldn't keep friends, that she was the unfortunate soul in all that. We had been friends for years, even dated for a while, parted ways on good terms, remained close friends. I hadn't realized how badly she treated me.

0	This sounds horribly familiar, shit. I saw all of this girl's friends abandon her while she was playing her victim, as if it was their fault that she couldn't keep her friends Behaved. We have been friends for many years, and even for some time we have been good friends and close friends. I didn't know how bad she treated me. One summer she started talking about how much she hated her current boyfriend and how frustrated he was trying to contact her (they stayed home from college during the summer and looked at each other. I couldn't). She ignored his call and complained to me all the time. This guy was the closest friend she had since I was, he was a perfect doormat. When school resumed, she suddenly became a companion to him again because he was the only one to tolerate her shit. I started to notice that all of her close friends had a personality type that rolled and shit without fighting back, and I noticed that it included me. A few months later she complained to me because all of her new college friends didn't agree with her about the little things and were talking about how they started abandoning her. I did. It was the most liberating thing to end it. To get her to understand her, I tried hard to avoid it, but there is always one emotional manipulator. There is a fucking reason that no one else stays with her and her friends.
0	It hardly sounds familiar, shit. I saw all the girl's friends deserting her while playing the victim, she acted so that she could hold no friends for her own fault, and in all this she was unhappy. We were friends for years, even dated for a while, divorced on good terms, and stayed close friends. I didn't understand how badly it brought me. One summer, she began to talk about how much her boyfriend hated running, how annoyed he was trying to touch her (they were home from college over the summer and couldn't see each other). I don't know who's calling and bitching about me the whole time. He was a great friend to this man, and when he had me, he was a total doormat. When school started back, suddenly buddy-buddy was with him, because he was the only person who could take his shit. I started to realize that all of my closest friends have the kind of personality that turns on and shit gets incompatible, and I realized that I understood. A few months later, I was bitching about all of her college friends bitching to me about not agreeing to the trivial things, and talking about how they had begun to abandon her. Ending: which thing delivers the most. I tried really hard to avoid it, to understand it, but there will always be one motion manipulator. There's no fucking reason no one else will stay with her friends.

0	This sounds normal, shit. I watched all the girl's friends throw her away while she was playing the victim, pretending that their mistake could not keep friends, that she was the unfortunate soul in all of this. We were friends for years, and then we fell in love for a while, we broke up, and we became close friends. I had no idea how badly he treated me. One summer, she started talking about how much she hated her current boyfriend, how annoyed she was that she was trying to contact him (they were home from college in the summer and did not see each other). He would ignore her calls and constantly harass me. This guy was the closest friend he had ever had since I was, he was a complete door keeper. When the school started again, he became a buddy again because he was the only person who could tolerate his filth. I started to notice that all of his close friends had a change of personality and took on shit without fighting, and I realized that that included me. A few months later he was biting me with all his new college friends who disagreed with him on very small things and talking about how they had started to dump him. Keeping that up was a big deal. I have tried hard to avoid it, to make him understand, but the emotional deceiver will always be alone. There is a bad reason why no one else will be his friend.
0	Congratulations! I did this a while ago to a very good friend with whom I was staying in a residence at the time. She was very controlling towards me and the rest of our mutual friends. We often fought because I would not take her unsolicited advice and would not tell her all the details of my past or present. She actually told me that "we can no longer be friends if I did not tell her everything." It was in connection with my visit with a guy from the class and not immediately back in the room. Eventually there was just a ridiculous fight and I snapped. It was as if someone had turned off a light switch to care for her at all. I just did not care anymore. I no longer cared a fuck about her and just stopped interacting. I no longer fought with her, and I did not go along with her ways of apologizing. I would simply say something like "No thanks" or "I'm busy." Best decision I've ever made. I was so much happier after cutting her out of my life.
0	Congratulations! I did this to a very close friend a long time ago while I was living in a dorm with him. She was very controlling with me and the rest of our mutual friends. We fought a lot because I wouldn't take her unsolicited advice or tell her all the details of my past or present. She actually said to me, "If I don't tell her everything, we can't be friends." It was about me hanging out with a classmate and not going back to the room right away. It just ended up being some ridiculous fights and I was furious. It was as if someone had turned off a light switch and didn't care about her at all. I just don't care anymore. I don't care about her anymore, just stop interacting. I didn't argue with her again, and I didn't go along with her way of apologizing. I'll just say things like "no thanks" or "I'm busy". Best decision I've ever made. I'm so much happier after cutting her out of my life.

She actually told me that "we couldn't be friends anymore if I didn't tell her everything". It was about me hanging out with a guy from class and not being back in the room right away. Eventually there was just a ridiculous fight and I broke down. It was as if someone had flipped off a switch caring about her. I didn't care anymore. I don't give a fuck about her anymore and just stopped interacting. I no longer argued with her and no longer accepted her way of apologizing. I would just say something like "No thanks" or "I'm busy". Best decision I've ever made. I was so much happier after removing her from my life.
0	Congratulations! I did this before a very close friend with whom I was living in a student room at the time. She was very controlled towards me and our other mutual friends. We often quarreled because I did not listen to her unwanted advice and I would not tell her all the details of my past or present. She actually told me that “we couldn’t be friends anymore if I didn’t tell her everything”. This was related to the fact that I was hanging out with the boy from the class and that I did not return to the room immediately. There was finally some ridiculous quarrel and I snapped. It was as if someone had turned off the light that he cared about her at all. I just didn't care anymore. I was no longer interested in her and I simply stopped communicating. I no longer quarreled with her and disagreed with her ways of apologizing. I would just say something like “No, thank you” or “I’m busy”. The best decision I ever made. I was much happier after I kicked her out of my life.
0	Congrats! I did this a long time ago to a very close friend who lived with me in the dorm room at the time. She had great control over the rest of me and our common friends. We fought so often because I didn't receive her one-sided advice and didn't give her all the details of my past or present. She actually told me, "If I didn't tell her everything, we couldn't be friends anymore." This was about I was hanging out with a guy in my class and didn't come back to my room right away. Finally there was a ridiculous battle and I snapped. It was like someone caring about her and turning off her lights. I didn't care anymore. I didn't have sex with her anymore, and just stopped interacting. I didn't fight her anymore, and I didn't follow her apology. Simply put, "Thank you" or "busy". The best decision I have ever made. I was very happy after she separated her from my life.
0	Well done! I did this quite a while ago with a friend who was living in a dorm room at the time. She guided me very much toward me and the other mutual friends. We fought many times, but didn't take the initiative, nor did I explain the details of the past or the present. She said to me "we could no longer be friends unless I told her everything". This was because I was hanging out with a guy from the class and he didn't immediately return to his room. In the end, I snapped some just ridiculous fights. Just turn off the light switch to completely shore up it. I just don't care anymore. I'm not going to fuck with her anymore and just discontinued one another. I didn't fight with her anymore, nor did I go along with her apology. I would simply say something like "No thank you" or "I'm Busy." The best decision ever made. I was so much happier after I cut her off from life.

0	Congratulations! I did this a long time ago with a very close friend of mine who I was living with at the time in the bedroom. He was very much in control of me and our other friends all around. We fought a lot because I did not accept his advice without being asked and I did not tell him all the things of my past or present life. He actually told me that "we can't be friends anymore if I don't tell him everything." This was related to me accompanying a boy from the classroom and not returning to the room immediately. Eventually there was just a silly battle and I hit. It was as if someone had switched off the light switch on him in the slightest. I didn't care anymore. I didn’t give a fuck about it anymore and just stopped interacting. I did not argue with him again, and I did not follow his apology. I would just say something like "No thank you" or "I'm busy." The best decision I have ever made. I was even happier after I ended my life.
0	Congratulations! I did this long ago to my roommate at the time. He was very much in control of me and the rest of our two friends. We constantly fought because I did not listen to his unsolicited advice and did not tell him all the details of my past or present. He actually said to me "we won't be friends if I don't tell him everything." This was about having me sit with a boy in class and not go back to the room right away. Eventually there was a funny fight and I just cried. It was as if someone were turning off the light to care for him at all. I didn't care. I stopped looking at her and just stopped communicating. I did not argue with him and did not go along with his apology. I can simply say "No thank you" or "I'm busy." The best decision I have ever made. I was so happy after taking her out of my life.

0	Professional appointments, work and classes (25 y / o professional student) I manage to beep in time. Just about everything else is in their air and I consider them all who have a margin of thirty minutes to be late. My rationale is that there are not many social commitments where it matters to be on time unless plans are time dependent (e.g. movie, travel). Also the people / groups who usually stress to make it in time, never offer repercussions for inertia, everything always goes on as planned. Really stopped giving it much importance after I realized authority figures kind of throw the word "mandatory" around for anything they want without much meaning behind it. As for my few friends who are really anal about time, yes, it bothers them, but it also makes for a bit of balancing for both of us: I'm there to make sure they do not become a tight hole anymore and they like me from becoming an even more irresponsible dick. Balance.
0	Professional appointments, jobs and classes (25 year old professional student) I managed to pass on time. Pretty much everything else is in their air, and I think they all have room to be thirty minutes late. My reasoning is that unless planning is time-related (eg, watching a movie, going on a trip), the importance of being on time doesn't have much of a social obligation. Also, people/groups who usually emphasize getting something done on time will never have an impact on being late and everything will always go according to plan. After I realized that authority figures just throw the word "mandatory" for whatever they want without much meaning, I really don't take it that much anymore. As for a couple of my friends, they really hate time, yes it annoys them, but it also keeps us both in balance: I'm making sure they don't become like a tight ass anymore, they stay Stayed me from becoming an even more irresponsible guy. balance.
0	Professional meetings, work and courses (25 year old professional student) I manage to be punctual. Pretty much everything else is up in the air and I consider them all to have thirty minutes leeway to be late. My reasoning is that there aren't many social obligations where being on time is important unless the plans are time-dependent (eg, a movie, going on a trip). Also, people/groups who normally insist on getting something done on time never offer repercussions for delays, everything always goes on as planned. I really stopped caring much about it after realizing that authority figures just threw the word "mandatory" for whatever they wanted without much meaning behind it. As for my few friends who are really anal about the weather, yeah it bothers them but it also provides some balance for both of us: I'm there to make sure they don't become a tight ass anymore and they keep me from become an even more irresponsible asshole. Balance.
0	Professional terms, work and teaching (student 25 years) I manage to pass on time. Almost everything else is in the air and I think they all have thirty minutes to be late. My reasoning is that there are not many social obligations in which it is important to arrive on time, unless the plans are time-bound (e.g. a movie, going on a trip). Also, people / groups who usually emphasize that something will arrive on time never give consequences for the delay, everything always just goes as planned. I really stopped attaching great importance to it after realizing that the authorities are simply throwing away the word “mandatory” for whatever they want without much sense behind it. As for my few friends who are really anal about time, yes, it bothers them, but it also allows balance for both of them: I’m here to make sure they don’t get cramped anymore and keep me from becoming an even more irresponsible dick. Balance.
0	Professional Appointment, Jobs, Classes (25-year-old professional student) I can squeak on time. Almost everything else is floating in their air and I see them all having 30 minutes to be late. My rationale is that unless the plan is time-dependent, there aren't many social obligations where it's important to be on time (for example, going to the movies, traveling). Also, people / groups who usually emphasize achieving something on time will never be affected by lateness and everything will always continue as planned. After realizing that an authoritative person didn't make much sense behind him and was like throwing the word "essential" at what he wanted, he really stopped giving it too much weight. As for my few friends who are really anal about time, yeah, it bothers them, but it also allows some balance for both of us: becoming an even more irresponsible anal. From that. balance.
0	Professional institutions, employers, and classes (25 y/o professional students) manage the buzz throughout the season. Just about all things are on the air and I consider them all having leeway for thirty minutes late. My reasoning is that there are not many social obligations where things take place over time unless time plans are contingent (for example, a movie, going on a journey). Also, a group of people who normally stress that for a certain period of time they never offer repercussions of slowness, as they always move on. In fact, I stopped giving it a lot of importance after I realized that some authority figures just throw the word "mandator" around to something that they want without much meaning behind it. With a few of my friends who are really anal around the time, those bugs eat, but it also allows a comparison of some of us both: make sure they don't become asses around me any longer and keep me. not even an irresponsible dick.

0	Professional appointments, job and classes (25 year professional student) I manage to chat in time. Just about everything else is up in the air, and I look at them as if everyone has thirty minutes to come too late. My reasoning is that there are not many social obligations where it is important to arrive on time unless the plans are time-dependent (eg film, travel on a trip). The people / groups who usually stress about making it something in time, also never have consequences for sensuality, everything always continues as planned. Really stopped giving it much meaning after I realized that authority figures in a way just throw the word "mandatory" around for everything they want without much meaning behind it.

0	Academic appointments, tasks, and classes (25-year-old academic student) I can squeeze in time. Almost everything else is on the air and I see them as they all have a thirty minute chance of delay. My argument is that there are not many social responsibilities where being on time is important unless planning depends on time (e.g., movies, travel). Also, people / groups who usually insist on doing something at the wrong time never produce the effect of delay, everything goes as planned. In fact I stopped giving it much importance after discovering the authority figures is just throwing the word "must" at whatever they want without much meaning behind it. As for my few friends who have absolutely no anus about time, yes it bothers them but also allows for balance for all of us: I am close enough to make sure they are no longer like donkeys and they keep me. from being the most irresponsible dick.

0	Professional appointments, work, and classes (25 year old student) I can joke on time. Almost everything else is high in the air and I look at them like everyone with a 30 minute minute leeway to arrive late. My reason is that there are not many social obligations where punctuality is important unless programs are time-dependent (e.g., movie, travel). Also, people / groups tend to pressure to do something when they never give the results of procrastination, everything always goes as planned. I really stopped giving it a lot of importance after I realized that the statistics of the authorities just threw the word "compulsory" at whatever they wanted without a big explanation behind it. As for my few friends who are really backwards about time, yes it disturbs them but also allows some balance for both of us: I am here to make sure they can no longer be a strong ass and keep me. since Dick is even more indifferent.

So, that was the first thing that turned me off. The second was his femininity, this guy was just so damn cool. He agreed with everything I said, so that made it quite difficult to have a conversation with him. I told him he was too nice, and he said "I'm sorry." We had sex and he could not stop thanking me, so much so that I began to feel extremely uncomfortable having sex with him. I finally get to the point where I decide that I just do not really like him and can not stand these conditions. I told him I was not interested in him and let him know. He's starting to tell me crazy he's going to get over it and I'm not sending him back. Surely he came. He knocked on my door and scared me to death. I did not think he was actually going to overcome.

After I broke it with him, I was behind him. He gets angry with me because he's talking to others. Ignore him. Well, there's a boyfriend who has an attachment and is as crazy as a woman.

I told him too nicely and said "I'm sorry." We had sex and couldn't thank him, so much so that I felt very uncomfortable about having sex with him. I finally reach the point where I picture myself alone, not really like him and unable to withstand these conditions. I told him that I don't care and he knows. Everyone starts texting me crazy saying that he would come and I am not texting him. Sure that shit is coming. He knocked on my door and scared the hell out of me. I did not think that he would come any longer. I say therefore to him that he ought to depart, because he was not called here. Only the USMC NCO answered the door with a sword and finally left.

1	Guys- About the video compared to the text: Travis probably gave George questions in advance, and allowed him to take the time to come up with detailed answers; Video interviews would have been great, but the answers we received would not have been fully developed / honest / true, and probably more based on emotions than truth. HotShot's intention in this discussion was to explain the decision and clarify any concerns / questions fans may have. With video chat, responses are not cuff / well thought out, so that would not be possible. Being able to step back and write down his responses let HotShot say what needed to be said in full / as much as possible in the switch list.
1	They do not always try to abuse the system. They only fall for silly scams. Most people just assume that because someone sent them the link on their friends list, it should be legal. Even though there were people who were hacked and said "I sent this link from someone on my friends list". This is literally mainly due to people clicking links without reading it, or after opening the link, just look at it, see it vaguely looks like the official LoL website and want them to sign up, and then try just log in without even thinking about it. Most people want an authenticator because then it is there to wipe their ass for them so they do not have to think or pay attention.

1	Don't always try to damage the system. I just fall into silly scams. Most people think that only if someone sends a link to their friend's list, it should be legitimate. Even people were hacked and they said "i have sent this link to someone in my friend's list". Literally most people clicking on links without picking them up, even after they have opened a link that they just dazzle, looks vaguely like the official LoL website and wants to log in, and just try and login without thinking about it. Most people want an authenticator, because then there's an ass to wipe them off, lest it bother them by thinking or paying attention.

1	Residents are trying to disrupt the system. They just fall into crazy scams. Most people just think that because someone on the list of friends sent them a link, it should be official. Or there have been some people who have been accused of "sending me this link from someone on my friends list". Especially low for people who click on links without reading them, or after opening a link they just look at it, see it look as dull as the official LoL website and want them to log in, and then try to log out. even thinking about it. Most people want an authenticator, because that's where they have to clear their asses so they don't bother to think or pay attention.

1	This may be the biggest thing that has ever happened to you. You have so much talent when it comes to this game, and if you practice your face down, you could be a potential pro player or at least in a challenging team. But all the shit you've whipped up in the community over the last few months with the boost, the rush, and the questionable stream content has caused many people to lose their trust in you. Now, and rightly so, you are prohibited from playing this game on the aforementioned accounts. Use this ban as a way to start anew. Create a new account, get it to 30, buy some champions, and hit diamond / challenger like you've done so many times. None of this is difficult for you, and I think if you have just started anew and cleared up your reputation a bit on both streams and on forums, you can be a great addition to the community.

Now, correctly, you are banned from playing this game on the above account. Use this ban as a way to start over.

1	This may be the best thing that has ever happened to you. There are so many talents about this game. If you practice the showdown, you may be a professional player, or at least a member of the Challenger team. But all of the boost, complaints, and suspicious stream content that has been tumultuous in the community over the past few months has lost trust to you to many. Now, and of course, you are prohibited from playing this game with the aforementioned account. Use this ban as a new way to get started. Create a new account, set it to 30, buy a champion and push diamonds / challengers as you've done many times. None of this is difficult for you. If you're new and have cleaned your reputation a bit on both streams and forums, I think you could be a great addition to the community.
1	The greatest thing could have happened to you. You have so much talent with this game and if you practice your face, you could be a team pro players or at least a challenger. But with all the shit that you have stirred up in the community over the past few months with boosting, bitching, and search content streams, a lot of people are distrustful of you. Now, rightly so, for the above reasons you are prohibited from playing this game. Use this injunction to start a new way. Create a new account, get it, buy some monsters, and push diamonds, as you've done so many times as an opponent. None of these things is difficult for you, and I think, if you had just begun your recent and refined reputation a little in the streams and abroad, it could be a great addition to the state.
1	This may be the biggest thing that has ever happened to you. You have so much talent when it comes to this game, and if you train on your face, you can be a potential professional player or at least on a challenger team. But all the crap you have stirred up in society over the last few months with the boosting, fooling around and the questionable power content has caused many to lose faith in you. Now, and rightly so, you are banned from playing this game on the mentioned accounts. Use this ban as a way to start over.

1	This could be the best thing that ever happened to you. You are very talented when it comes to this game and if you practice your head to head you could be a potential pro player or at least on a challenger team. However, all the shit you've caused in the community over the past few months with the push, the complaints, and the questionable streaming content has caused a lot of people to lose faith in you. Now, and rightly so, you are banned from playing this game on the aforementioned accounts. Use this ban as a way to start over. Create a new account, take it to 30, buy some champions, and hit diamond/challenging like you've done so many times. None of this is difficult for you, and I think that if you start fresh and clean up your reputation a bit both on streams and on the forums, you could be a great addition to the community.
1	This could be the biggest thing ever to happen to you. You have a lot of talent when it comes to this game and, if you practice turning your face, you can be the best player or at least on the opposing team. However, all the filth that has crept into the community over the past few months with the promotion, sting, and questionable flow of content has made many people distrust you. Now, and rightly so, you have been banned from playing this game on the accounts mentioned above. Use this ban as a way to restart. Create a new account, up to 30, buy some winners, and push the diamond / challenge if you have done it many times. None of this is difficult for you, and I think if you start over and clean up your reputation a bit in the flow and debates, you can be a great addition to the community.

1	Many of you seem to hate him for what he did in the past, the thing is he paid his membership fees. He was banished, in fact, he submitted HIMSELF. The point of being banned is to make "Even" for what you did. With the "Proof" he provided, it appears that he was banned for no reason or for a reason that does not deserve a Perm ban. I understand he did shit in the past, in fact I hated XJ9 (Also, most other boosters made me angry too.) But he apologized for doing it by himself surrender, take the punishment and move on. His stream has changed from what I saw, he seems to be a much less toxic person, it's not the point of being banned from making them less toxic. He's not a terrible person and I feel like this ban was unfair.
1	A lot of you seem to hate him for what he has done in the past, the problem is that he paid the price he deserved. He was banned, in fact he turned himself in. The purpose of being banned is to "balance" what you do. With the "proof" he provides, he appears to be banned for no reason or for reasons that don't deserve it. I know he's done some bad things in the past, in fact I used to hate the XJ9 (plus, most of the other boosters pissed me off too.) But he apologized for it and turned himself in, accepted the punishment and moved on. His streams are different from what I've seen, he seems to be a much less toxic person, not banned for the purpose of making them less toxic. He is not a terrible person and I feel this ban is unjust.
1	Many of you seem to hate him for what he has done in the past, the fact is he paid his dues. He was banished, in fact he surrendered HIMSELF. The whole point of getting banned is to give back "Even" for what you did. With the "evidence" he provided, he appears to have been banned for no reason or for a reason that doesn't deserve Perm's ban. I understand he's done shit in the past, in fact I hated XJ9 (Plus most of the other boosters pissed me off too.) But he apologized for doing so on surrender, took the punishment and moved on. His stream has changed from what I've seen, he seems like a much less toxic person, isn't the point of getting banned is to make them less toxic. He's not a terrible person and I feel like this ban was unfair.
1	Many of you seem to hate him for what he has done in the past, the thing is that he has paid his obligations. He was banned, he actually surrendered. The point of the ban is to equate yourself for what you did. With the “Evidence” he provided it seems to have been banned for no reason or for a reason that does not deserve the ban from Perm. I realize he’s done shit in the past, I actually hated XJ9 before (Also, most other amps also pissed me off.) But he apologized for doing it by surrendering, receiving punishment, and moving on. Its course has changed from what I have seen, it seems to be a far less poisonous person, isn’t the purpose of the ban to make them less toxic. He’s not a terrible person and I feel like this ban was unfair.
1	Many of you seem to hate what he has done in the past. He paid his membership fee. He was banned, in fact he turned him back. The point of being banned is to make an "even" for what you have done. The "evidence" he provided seems to have banned him for no reason or for reasons not worthy of a perm ban. He has had shit in the past. In fact, I hated the XJ9 (and most of the other boosters also offended me). His flow has changed from what I saw, he seems to be a much less toxic person, the point of being banned is not to make them less toxic. He is not a terrible person and I feel that this ban was unjustified.
1	A lot of you guys seem to hate what happened before, the thing is paying off your debts. it is forbidden, it turns itself against itself. The point is forbidden to do "yes" for what you've done. When the "Proof" was provided, it seems that there was no reason or reason for the injunction that does not deserve a "Perm ban". I've done shit that in the past, I used to hate XJ9 in fact (Also, most of the other boosters pissed me off.) But he apologized for turning himself in, and took the penalty. The river has been seen changed, it seems to be a far less toxic man, has it not been forbidden to prevent it from being poisonous? He is not an awesome person and I feel like this ban is illegal.

His power has changed from what I've seen, he seems to be a far less toxic person, is not the point of being banned from making them less toxic. He's not a terrible person, and I feel that this ban was unfair.

The point of getting banned is to "Even" for what you've done. With the "Proof" you've provided, it appears to have been banned for no reason or for a reason that doesn't deserve Perm's ban. I get that he's done some shit in the past, in fact I used to hate XJ9 (plus most of the other boosters pissed me off too). But he apologized for doing it by turning himself in, took the punishment and moved on.

1	Many of you seem to hate him for what he did in the past, the thing is that he paid his dues. He was banned, he actually turned HIMSELF. The issue of suspension is to do "Even" for what you did. For the "Evidence" he provided he appears to be banned for no reason or for a reason that does not apply as a Perm ban. I find out that he did shit in the past, I really hated the XJ9 (Also, many of the other additions annoyed me too.) But he apologized for doing so by turning around, taking the punishment and moving on. His flow has changed from what I saw, he seems to be a non-toxic person, not that the purpose of the ban is to keep them non-toxic. He’s not a bad person and I feel like this ban was unfair.
1	Most of you seem to hate him for what he did before, the only thing is to pay. He was blocked, in fact he gave himself up. The point of ban is to do "Even" for what you have done. The "evidence" he provided appears to have been barred without any reason or reason not justified by the Perman ban. I found out he did shit in the past, I actually used to hate XJ9 (Also, most of the other boosters annoyed me too.) But he apologized for doing that in self-defense, took the punishment and went on. His stream has changed from what I have seen, he seems to be a very ugly person, not that the point of the ban is to make them less toxic. He’s not a bad person and I feel like this ban is wrong.

1	This. I'm very much against toxicity, I really am. I hate it when things become personal and people can't acknowledge their errors and flame instead. BUT this really is playful banter/mental warfare without hurting anyone. I played as Singed against an AD Nidalee top in a ranked once (somehow he was plat IV when i was in my promo to gold IV). I got ganked and gave away FB, but I wouldn't let that drag me down. I'm a good spirit and kept on. I asked our jungler for a gank which never came, and i died multiple times because 3 people came top (once singed gets RoA and Ult you pretty much can't kill him anymore as nid). So this went on 3 or 4 times while the rest of my team stomped their lanes because I had all the pressure (even though i was not worth anything). While this went on I went ahead and asked nidalee what happened to her farm (i was leading by 10cs because I was proxying). This frustrated said plat player so much, he afk'ed in base and proceeded to shittalk his team.
0	I'll throw my feelings on the subject into the discussion.   A restaurant is a faceless corporation that exists to charges you money to give you a night off from having to cook your own meal and gives you an enjoyable atmosphere to experience it all in.   This corporation is run by people, when a person comes in 5 minutes to closing, it makes the corporation more money and the staff it requires to keep it open specifically to serve you a few extra dollars, but honestly... When you're working 40hours a week an at the end of an eight hour shift you don't give a shit and all they wanna do is go home, relax away the loud crazy kids, the bitchy people who didn't get their food prepared perfectly, but they can't because a few selfish people don't want to cook their own food tonight.   I honestly believe that no one should be allowed to order food within 20 minutes of closing time, cooks and servers need time to clean their stations so they can go home.
1	Alright this post is one of the first in a while that has inspired me to respond to because it relates to my situation right now.   So first off for me, there are dreams (like being a billionaire) and attainable goals such as going pro. Now I have been a huge video game player since I was about 5, I started with prince of persia and command and conquer and immediately fell in love with the experience and immersive world of video games. From there I didn't play much seriously until I discovered Counter-Strike, this game changed my life and changed my view on skills I never knew I had before. I soon discovered that I had a natural talent for video games, first person shooters especially. I played Counter-Strike for about 7 years straight and had my first taste of becoming pro or at least semi-pro, I wont go into details but I was very successful and came very close to going to WCG Singapore one year. But my limitations sadly enough were my parents, they are old school and wanted me to play real sports and focus on getting straight A's rather than chasing a fully attainable dream at the time. To backtrack a little, the reason I didn't go to singapore was because of sponsorship backing that fell through and my parent's inability to see that this was a huge opportunity for me.   So forward from there I just played casual because my dreams were crushed and just focused on winning tangible sports in the minds of my peers at the time. Now comes my recent experiences, I have been in college for quite some time and was introduced to league of legends through a close friend of mine and started to play it a good amount but no where near where I am now. That was nearly 3 years ago, over that time I became more and more infatuated with the game and played it in my spare time and started to realize that my personal skill for video games was carrying over. Before I knew it I was 2100 in season 2, that's when I realized that my dream could become a goal. I wasn't necessarily miserable at college but I felt like I was missing something from my life, and that was the dream of becoming pro for league of legends or any video game to that regard. So one day I just decided to say screw it why not go for it, I'm old enough to make my own decisions and old enough to support myself.   Many people right now are probably like who are you, why would you do this, this doesn't seem like a good idea. Well that may be a reasonable argument but not if you set yourself goals and set yourself to something higher than a dream. (Sorry going to go on a tangent) But think about how many people dream of being an astronaut, they grow up still thinking about that dream but it is unattainable because they never set themselves a real tangible goal. By this I mean they didn't spend years preparing to become an astronaut with all of their resources and will power, they left it as a dream. That's where I think a lot of people need to make the distinction of why they want to be a pro or why they play the game as much as they do.   I set myself the goal of 1 year off of school to go for it, working full time to support myself through it. Every day I read all the information I can on the meta, what teams are doing what, who is being interviewed, who is streaming, what amateur or professional games are being played or those that I missed. This is what it takes in my opinion to really make a dream happen, to an extent because still personal aptitude towards video games and mechanical skill makes a big difference. There will always be some people who hit there limitation because of their biological wiring or tragedies that leave them unable to hit the level of some players.   I've been writing way too much here, i'm sorry, but I feel very strongly about my dream and I want it to become a reality with everything I am right now invested into it. In closing I just want to say if this REALLY is your dream, go for it, but be smart about it and make a plan so you can attain it to the best of your ability.
1	I think they are all getting nerfs because all the popular jungles, with the exception of Lee Sin, all had point and click power. Each of them could front load all their damage into you with spells that had no outplay potential. Given even if you dodged Elise's Cocoon, you still took a good 30-40% of your hp because she has Sorc shoes from her Human/Spider Q combo.   Eve became stronger due to the vision changes, we all know that. Panth is a point and click powerhouse, and also comes with free point and click hard CC.   Kha'zix is a pubstomper since people naturally isolate themselves in solo queue as teamplay is less likely to happen. He's also point and click powerhouse with an insane stealth mechanic that allows him to escape 99% of bad situations he's in unless your team can CC him to death (R > Evolved Leap is lulz).   Lee Sin is in a league all his own, in my opinion, compared to the other jungles. You have to outplay your opponent to win situations with him, but once you get a grasp on him and what you can and can't do with his kit outplaying in solo queue becomes easier and easier. Leading to those fed Lee Sins that Q your AD and then 2 shot them while escaping your backline untouched.
0	ultimately, if you're making an honest effort to sleep, and find yourself still awake for hours AND that lack of sleep is negatively impacting your life, AND it's your constant companion  then you have some degree of insomnia. If some one you loved died, or you lost your job, having trouble sleeping is a normal part of the stress and while traumatic isn't really insomnia. For people in that situation ask about lunesta or ambien, they were made with you in mind (more on meds later). The average person falls asleep in about 15 minutes (my head exploded when i learned that).  For a lot people, simple lifestyle changes can fix it. go to bed at the same time every night. force yourself to wake up at the same time no matter how little you slept (this is supposed to reset your circadian rhythm). don't eat at least four hours before bed. no caffeine after noon, use your bedroom for nothing but sleep and sex and stay physically active. For many many people this resolves their problems. unfortunately for many it doesn't.   some people just have a broken internal clock. left on my own, my natural rhythm seems to be 30-35 hours awake, 12-14 asleep. when i could get away with it, i was able to sleep easily  and wake when i intended. I'm told my case is extreme but i think that's unlikely. i think a lot of insomniacs would find some thing similar but just don't have the chance because our whole world (literally)  is based on  a 24 hour day.  I'm yet to find a solution. But, recently i started taking Lamictal, an anti seizure med used to treat bipolar by balancing the brain (somehow, magic maybe? if someone knows more about how it works, I'd be grateful to hear); I've noticed my sleep has been vastly improved. It used to be maybe once a week I'd sleep more than 3 hours, but now i sometimes i get a solid 6 hour night and only four or five all nighters a month. I still tend to clock in at three or four  a night but that's worlds apart from consistent zeros.   I don't know if anyone is researching lamictal as a sleep aid. It does have some serious, sometimes fatal, side effects; But if my case turns out to be more than just an anomaly, I think it could greatly improve the lives of millions of people.   In my case, for my entire life i thought I was just a lazy piece of shit but even with just those couple extra hours a night i can not just hold a job but excel at one. I'd love to see other insomniacs given this opportunity.   For those who question if maybe regulating my bipolar issues is the reason my sleep improved. That's probably a factor but there were plenty of years during which my depression was limited to mild episodes and with virtually no mania. So while obviously i don't think my one case proves anything, I really hope someone looks in to it.   I haven't addressed sleeping pills. here's the thing,  any otc sleep aid is repackaged benedryl and will be just as effective. for insomniacs it tends not to help but if it does for you, great! On the other hand Lunesta and Ambien are intended for short term use, for people going through hard times or stressful situations. it's not meant to be used for more than a couple months.   A final word to the wise: There are many gimmicks and pseudoscience products out there. some claim to influence brain waves, others claim they take away the bad thoughts or wash away the toxins. I can't stress this enough, THAT'S ALL BULLSHIT. Concerned generous  coworkers have bought me these over the years and because i appreciated that they cared enough about me to spend their own money to help me out, i tried everyone of them. I didn't find a single one helpful. even with the soothing sound cds  i found my brain zeroing in on the patterns, predicting the moment the bird would call, timing the space between the whoosh of the wind and Rustle of the leaves. The last thing an insomniac needs is extra stimuli.   After a few weeks I'd give up and when i was asked how it worked I'd say it helped a little, thank you for thinking of me and quietly tuck it away in a closet never to be seen again.
1	It 100% is. There's nothing wrong with rushing a Last Whisper, it just means that you need to tank up ASAP and can't build an item like Bloodthirster (which gives damage and sustain) or Mallet (damage and tankiness). Last Whisper just gives 100% damage.   In that regard, though...say you were to go 3 Dorans into LW, versus 3 Dorans into Brutalizer, assuming an opponent with ~120 armor:   An uncharged autoattack:   107 AD at level 9 (w/ 3 Dorans), versus 120 armor  132 AD at level 9 (3 Dorans + brut), versus 120 armor  132 AD at level 9 (3 Dorans + pickaxe), versus 120 armor  147 AD at level 9 (3 Dorans + LW), versus 120 armor  207 AD at level 9 (3 Dorans + BT), versus 120 armor   100 / 220 = .45   107 = 48.6 true damage.  100 / 205 = .49   132 = 64.4 true damage.  100 / 220 = .45   132 = 60.0 true damage.  100 / 160 = .625   147 = 91.876 true damage.  100 / 220 = .45 * 207 = 94 true damage.
0	Non-nerds can have acne and be nonathletic too... You'd be surprised at how many cliche' "unpopular" people are not, indeed, nerds or geeks.   I think most women value passion. If you talk about programming with a passion and are good at it, women respond to that, whether it's their "fetish" or not. Women are attracted to men being good at things or at least spending time and effort on them. Obviously there are MANY variables but many nerds I know have been with "regular" and pretty girls because they find the success and/or dedication hot.   Even if the woman is not particularly into the nerdy thing (programming, building your own alarm clock from scratch, whatever it is that you do) they are interested in your dedication. For example when my friend was working on his antenna project his girlfriend would just give him a kiss and go out with her girl friends.
1	I have been since I started this game.  I have only recently started learning how to play ranged carries (with some success).   Earley levels I was always the tank. Always the tank.  Once I got level 20 I was the tank and the jungler (yay rammus).  Now I am usually support.   When I do play a ranged carry in a premade, there is always 1 other (now its vayne) and no jungler.
1	The first sentence is clearly true. The part about Elo hell being a myth - not so much.   If your 'true' Elo is 1800, then of course you're going to be able to carry your way out of the sub-1200 bracket. But what if your true Elo is, say 1350 or so? You certainly deserve to be matched with better players than you're getting in the sub-1200 bracket, but the skill difference isn't pronounced enough that you can simply take over every game you play to get out of that bracket. With the amount of variance inherent in a solo queue system that matches five strangers together based on individual rating from a team game, combined with the new-to-ranked players starting at 1200, someone who isn't significantly better than that general bracket but who still doesn't necessarily belong there will need to have a run of good luck to not have every winning streak offset by a run of leavers, feeders, and fresh 30s.   The problem is exacerbated by the double elo gain/loss at the beginning of your ranked career. I have no problem with the variance, and I accept that streaks happen. But I got my streak of leavers/feeders early on - i lost 6 of 7 games at one point. Then, I went on to win 9 of my next 11 - but whoops, unluckily for me, the double elo gain period ended right when my losing streak stopped (literally - the last loss was -45, and the first win of the 9 of 11 run was +21), so I  still  dropped 67 Elo despite being 10-8 in that stretch. The win-loss variance worked out, but the Elo difference sure as hell didn't.   Elo hell as a concept is most certainly overused as an excuse by idiots who don't know any better - but that doesn't mean it doesn't exist. Being matched up with three-digit Elo players at 1100 is just such a nightmare; true, 1300 isn't THAT much better in the grand scheme, but at least there you'll probably only have an 1100 as the worst player on your team, and the difference is night and day.
0	I think China is behind all this.  Kim doesn't care about NK as much as when the next pie will land in his stomach.  China is the real power in that region and has the most vested interest in maintaining a semi-friendly buffer from SK/US.  As soon as real open hostility starts between NK and SK/US, China's forces will just roll across the Yalu and be the first to get into Pyongyang -- with the diplomatic excuse being to help the SK/US and the World getting rid of this rogue state, but with the real intention being to create a new friendly puppet state as the buffer.  To accomplish this, China manipulated/coerced Kim into the saber-rattling.  Once complete, NK will start to develop healthily and stop being a pest, SK and US will be happy and continue to trade with China, Kim can still munch on all the pie he wants in China, and most importantly, there will be a much friendlier and stabler buffer where NK is.  Everybody's happy.  Best case scenario.
1	well, if you are picking it instead of wriggles, you are probably talking about lee jungle. if its lee jungle, its just dumb. hydras its expensive and you cant just afk farming as lee jungle or rush it because you will be a squishy champion. you wont deal dmg in teamfights and most likely will be useless. focusing on farming as lee jungle at the mid-late stages of the game its dumb aswell, because you will be stealing farm from the real carries (adc, apc) and still you will be probably not as tanky as you should be to be able to peel and move around the teamfights aplying slow and dmg. if it isnt lee jungle that you are talking about you should learn more from the game. wriggles isnt core. it is a situational item when laning and most likely a top laner item. and in many situations (probably its good getting wriggles against nidalee or some heavy ad poke and sustain champion) its just better to gear up some armor or mr and rush bt, brutalizer, lw or any item that is more effective on lee sin. honestly, i dont think its a good item on lee. i never tested it but if i only can imagine building hydra on a lee mid where you are able to farm hundreds of creeps, roam around the map, clear jungle camps, etc. and, of course, as mid laner, you will most likely be one of the main sources of dmgs. and still, i think its bad. because when you play as lee mid you will try to one shot a squishy champion, get the fuck out, wait for your cds, peel and burst another champ. you cant simply make use from all the hydras' active, apply all the dmg you could because you will be an easy target. i main lee sin. i can play him jungle, mid, top, support, whatever and my top rating is 2.1k s2.
0	I really really hate how little you understand of what you're talking about. The population of Australian is less than a tenth of the U.S. over about the same amount of land. When you have more people things change, not to mention the entire infrastructure of the two nations is entirely different. There are more factors involved than how long you live and how happy you are. If an entire nation is made up of middle to upper class white men then guess what: they're going to be happier all around than a nation comprised of many different cultures and wealth levels.   When you have a room with ten people in it you can say that there are three rules, and almost everyone will follow those rules. When you have a room with 50 people (the same size room as the one with 10) you cannot apply the same rules without problems arising. Let's assume that you have a classroom with 20 desks. The room with 10 people has everyone with a desk. The room with 50 has some sharing and others left out entirely. When asked about how happy they are with their seating the room with 10 people has a higher overall rating, but that's not because the rules for deciding who has desks are better or that the desks themselves are better: the problem is that one side has a surplus, one side has deficit. You can't look at the room with 50 people and go 'Well why don't you give everyone a desk?' because all of the desks are taken.   Throughout history, from Rome to the British Empire, a rise in population has been associated with a decrease in the general well being of said population. It causes poverty, squalor, and discontent. This is not a flaw in the nation: it is a fact of life. The happiest places on earth all have large amounts of land and very few people. Take a survey of rural Idaho or Texas and you find the same thing; people are happier.   You're an idiot, and a direct result of the internet media that has drilled the idea of America being an evil, omniscient and omnipotent being standing on the edge of plunging the world into chaos, when it's really just a bunch of confused people trying to perserve their way of living in a world that won't support it. This doesn't make them evil, and it doesn't mean that they're trying to conquer the world or torture those with less. Hate mongering of the kind you spread is just as bad as the hate being spread by the U.S.'s media, it promotes ignorance and intolerance.
1	That's not the correct way to think about it.   If you belong in a higher division, you are basically guaranteed to reach your promos.  Why?  You're winning around 50% of your games and getting more LP per win than is taken in a loss.   Once you reach your promos then it's a best of 3 or 5.  At this point you have 50% chance of being promoted.
1	Did you just use the numbers for a 2000 hp target on a 1500 hp target?   now imagine just lowering that by 25% for MR.  You still haven't killed an AD carry and you have blown everything.  You haven't made it 6v4 and you have no sustainability in team fights because you didn't get WotA.  You also have gold invested in stats that you don't need.   What you are building for is strength at a very specific point in the game, but due to your items choices you probably will fall off harder later on.  Also, DFG does 30% of current health (not 35% like you're using).   Now reduce your DFG damage by 175 damage and your ult by 72.5 damage.  so its 450+450+217.5+1.4 AP+(AP/100 0.035*current HP of target)(The AP ratio on the ult isn't 0.4, but I don't even want to bother calculating it) = 1,117.5 Without factoring AP.  Now your 1500 HP target is still alive and given that they probably had about 25% damage reduction, you've only done a little over half their hp in damage.  The ignite and the rest of your ult wont kill them.  They probably also have lifesteal and heal and escapes.  So you essentially did nothing in that team fight.   What youre comparing it to is will of the ancients because thats a more common first item than Deathcap.   Which will do less damage, but you just gave your team a nice aura.   The question is, what do you build after your DFG?  The person who built the will can now go for deathcap or Rylai, what do you get?  What do you get when you can't burst a target down anymore (which you werent even doing in the first place)?   The other question is, why didnt you max W before Q?  If you actually intend to teamfight that W is more useful for yourself, your own AD carry or, if you really went more glass cannon, your initiator.  W base damage on a single target would be 480 damage, now if its someone who jumped into the fray (like yourself because you would have spellvamp instead of a DFG) it'd do even more, which would keep your shield up better which would keep you alive longer which would allow you to do more damage.
1	I find that practicing CS in custom games doesn't really help you, because it doesn't simulate the situation you're going to be in in most of you games.   In 5v5, you're going to be up against another AD carry and support bot. They will try and pressure you and harass you, making it harder to last hit. In customs, you don't have that pressure, and if you get used to it, you won't do well in real games. If you just practice in a regular 5v5 or ranked, you'll learn h ow to deal with that pressure and slowly do better.
1	The one champion I can profess loving is Malphite. I know that he is not the greatest tank or anything but most people simply don't expect the kind of playstyle he presents. I play my Malphite on the edge of my seat constantly initiating team fights, as well as making sure all my abilities are utilized every fight. I don't save for last hitting, but I don't hold back to chance someone escaping either.   Some people call it kill stealing when I come from side jungle to shard an almost dead enemy that just successfully flashed away from my team. I call that shutting them down. A lot of my gameplay wreaks psychological warfare on the enemy team. I harass hard and often early and mid game so people end up running from me mid and late game despite the fact I have not nearly as much DPS as they do.   I love playing all the champions equally, but for some reason Malphite just clicks with me when I play him. I know how and when to push versus pulling back and baiting for the rest of my team, only to ult back in and stunlock them for our alpha strike.   Finally, his passive. So many times his passive has saved me from silly things. Face checking brush, when a Shaco dagger comes flying out of nowhere? That's alright....my passive tanks it for me, no HP lost!
1	It gives him two major things that, as a tanky-caster, he needs; HP and AP. The slow is honestly the least of my concern, and it's an afterthought most often. The HP gain from it is fairly large, and likewise the AP is respectable. While Hourglass certainly gives him the AP/Armor bonus, I don't find it always that useful. Swain is a character that should stay mobile, especially when his ulti is going and he has Sunfire. He's not like Kennen who can rush into a group with his ulti going, invul, and straight up wreck the other team. He should be tanky enough to not need the invul anyways, and from my build I have enough armor to deal with most AD champs.   Swain is somewhat unique in the fact that as his damage isn't burst, but a very quick ramp up. Once hit with the dot, the full combo takes about 2-3 seconds to fully land. Since Swain is not a bursty champion, having the extra hit points does certainly help. While his AoE is respectable, most of it's damage comes from being in a prolonged fight. Without items/runes/etc, Swain only hits about 1700 HP. The three HP items I listed give a combined HP total of 1330, making him at about 3030 HP.. Which I think fits very nicely into the role of a tank, which is how I play him, and helps prolong his damage.   I'm by no means saying my build is the best, but it's fun and does well, especially since it's honestly kinda dumb. To me, that matters most.
0	This is going to get downvoted to hell, but I'm still not entirely sold that Snowden is the hero Reddit keeps saying he is. As a liberal, atheist & catlover, I usually agree with everything that the hivemind thinks, but on this issue, I have my reservations.   Obviously the NSA has gone overboard with their spying, but America is fighting many wars right now, and the war on terrorism especially isn't one that can be fought in the light and on the table. Terrorism has to be fought in the shadows because that's where they attack from. The phone calls they record are calls between the US and a FOREIGN COUNTRY for a reason. They're not spying on random citizens for the sake of spying. You and I don't work in anti-terrorism efforts. We don't know how many plots they've foiled, whether or not their efforts have saved lives, or if that's how they caught osama bin laden and others like him. My point is, you and I don't work in the day to day of national security. We don't know what's necessary to fight a war and protect the most targeted country in the world from attacks that could come from anywhere. I'm sure it's a lot harder than it looks from the safety of our own homes. Maybe if we were in the office, if we were in Congress or if we were Obama, we'd make the same decisions too.   I still believe in Obama, and this is why: I feel like i know him. I've listened to his speeches since he was just a Senator, observed the actions he's taken in his life both personally and politically, looked at his voting record, read his books, etc. The reason why I voted for him twice is because I believe he's a good guy who fundamentally believes in the same things that I do. I don't agree with Ron Paul's values. I don't agree with Mitt Romney's values. But I agree with Obama's. Believing in a president doesn't mean that you have to like everything he does, but I trust his values, intelligence, and judgment. I believe that he wouldn't do support something like this unless there was a strong national security justification that he only began to understand when he became President.
0	First off that wasnt the point. The person i replied to said that you have your friends back no matter what even if they are wrong to the core. Excuse me but if my friend robs a bank youre damn sure im going to report it. The problem is everyone thinking OP is wrong is childish. This isn't the school yard. These are situations that can ruin people. For a very long time. And on top of that, the wife directly asked OP. So what most of the OP haters are saying is that he betrayed his friend. So OP is also supposed to compromise his morals too?   Cheating is fucked up for a reason. OPs friend is no longer trustworthy. For fucks sake, we sacked the director of the CIA for getting tail on the side. Why? If we cant trust the nations top spy on staying faithful to his wife how can we trust him we stayinh faithful to us. OPs friend lost the privileges of frienship when he cheated because now OP cant trust the friend.
0	This may sound silly, but thank you. You give me hope for my future.   I'm 25, and surrounded by people who either are having kids or getting married. They keep telling me about all the horrible things that could happen to the child the older you get, and you're "statistically" likely to have a healthier child if you have one in your 20s or 30s.   While I don't want to be a dad now, I would like to be a dad someday, but realistically, I don't think I would be able to handle it until I'm 40.

0	Pretty much the whole old testament goes on about the ages of the Patriachs, Genesis 5.31-6.3   > ^30 And Lamech lived after he begat Noah five hundred ninety and five years, and begat sons and daughters: ^31 And all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy and seven years: and he died. ^32 And Noah was five hundred years old: and Noah begat Shem, Ham, and Japheth.  ^1 And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born to them, ^2 That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of which they chose. ^3 And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.
1	I love playing Viktor, by far my strongest ap mid-lane.  A lot of people don't understand how powerful he is in lane, and even fewer learn how to utilize his toolbox effectively.  Below I provide some insight, and is highly my own opinion.  Nonetheless, I hope the information is helpful :)   The main reason players don't pick Viktor in Ranked is because he is considered high-risk high-reward.  His skill-shot E is difficult for some to get used to and even harder to master.  The ability to land it for harass and cs efficiently literally defines how your game will go.  If you get out-csed and get killed, you have effectively ruined your chance at snowballing quickly and being able to aid your fellow teammates in other lanes, negating the reward from playing Vik in the first place.  Another thing to take in to account is Viktor's ability to escape.  Though Gravity Field provides an amazing form of cc in a potential slow/stun, if the opponent(s) avoids it you better hope you have Flash off cd or you are not going to survive (lane-awareness op, pay attention).   The wasted item slot arguments are negligible, as the burst provided from Augment:Death is very powerful throughout the game (+99ap 30% DoT for 4 secs is very powerful and more than many items in the shop can boast).   I also see people argue him having low range sometimes...which doesn't make sense, because his E is probably one of, if not THE, most versatile ranged poke in the game.  If you're taking and leveling his Q first, you're doing it wrong and wasting the reward you get from playing Viktor in the first place.  Don't get me wrong, his Q is decent.  It scales better to ap and is more mana-efficient, but it is really only useful in closing out a combo or last hitting minions.  If you want to get a lead on your opponent, you need to be able to control them in lane and apply pressure, Q provides very little of that.  E gives you that ability.   Viktor's Chaos Storm is one of the most unappreciated ults in the game imo.  It does massive AoE AND it silences on first contact.  In addition, it can be rooted to a champion or a location.  Another thing that many forget is that it ticks faster and faster the closer it is to Viktor, a fact that is easily utilized when being tower-dove.  Much like his E, this ult is incredibly versatile.   In a game like LoL, where lane pressure defines how games are won, champions like Viktor are useful in providing insane pressure with his spell arsenal while trading a bit of survivability and adding some margin for error with his skillshots.

1	I'm not sure what kind of immunity you mean. If you mean legally, it's the 1st amendment of the US Constitution.   If it's a social one, as in immune to being condemned and shunned by the community, it's because society in general is more accepting of "rascism" when it comes from a minority, if a white streamer did things like that, it would be less accepted. That being said, I still don't think that he would really get the criticism you're looking for either because:   I don't really see anything wrong with what he did.  Poking fun at a certain region's accent (no matter your race, the region you live your life in determines your accent for the most part) isn't hateful in my mind, it's entertaining.  There will always be a butt-end of a joke, it's just how you react to it.   The second thing is a "racial slur" which can be hateful/offensive, but it's all in the tone. He was obviously joking and wasn't implying that his was the master-race and superior to the various racial backgrounds of the competitors at Worlds.
1	This is pretty irrelevant but I think Doublelift and Chauster are better bot lanes in terms of skills. I see all these TSM vs CLG games recently and Doublelift manages to keep up in cs with Vayne (weak early game champions). Coupled with the fact that there is almost never jungle presence at bottom because Hotshotgg camps top almost all games, and TOO and Regi force dragons and ganks at bot. With all these advantages you would probably think that Chaox would have the greater advantage and influence in the game, however I see Doublelift usually surpassing his cs mark and doing more of an influence then him against the suppressing factors.   But Chaox is a good theorycrafter and shotcaller which Doublelift completely lacks so.
1	At the end of the day it's just something that you have to be aware of. When you start right clicking champs, be aware of which ones have one and don't attack them if you can avoid it in a situation where you need to be mobile. The active isn't something you can avoid usually, so you'll have to use your kiting tools to survive the couple seconds where it's on.
0	I'm commenting to give people some insight (I've had it happen a couple times).  Honestly, I'd love to hear people's feedback on this. I'm not talking about this specific instance necessarily.  I'm speaking about the typical too drunk to give consent rape scenero.  A great example of this would be the great "HJ bandit" that would frequent my fraternity. A girl who would jerk off guys while they were sleeping.  I wasn't one of them.   You really don't realize it, honestly.  The concept you are bringing up doesn't materialize in your thinking, although it should.  You chalk it up as a mistake that you made, and that the situation was your fault.  "Damn, I screwed up.  I shouldn't have drank that much last night."   Granted, you DON'T really feel violated/raped/taken advantage of etc.  You don't feel like that because, in your mind, you weren't taken advantage of. "Ah, I fucked up a bit last night, oh well - Pass me a beer, bro!"  It doesn't seem like that big of a deal.  In your mind you just weren't sober enough to stop it.  The concept of being too drunk to give consent doesn't really come to light.   I've read your same type of comment on Reddit before.  That's when it kinda "clicked".   I'd say it's technically rape. It's just weird to wrap your head around that when said guy doesn't feel violated.  If I can't jump into bed with a girl after she passes out, why can she? Forget that noise, man.  After I realized this it kinda pissed me off.  If I told you no earlier in the night, why do you think it's okay to find me, blacked out, at 3AM and take me to bed?  Personally, if this were to happen I would still mainly blame myself for getting too drunk.  That still doesn't mean I wasn't taken advantage of.  THAT ALSO DOESN'T MEAN DRUNK GIRLS HAVE IT COMING.  That is a very dangerous and horrible thing to think.   What's interesting is if this were to happen again, I still wouldn't feel like a rape victim.  I'd be a bit mad, but not typical rape victim feelings.  Idk I'd love to hear your thoughts on this.   Also, I'm not talking about that "I got really drunk and hooked up with a fat chick -eww" bull shit.  That's your own damn fault.  I"m speaking about being taken advantage of.   Sorry, didn't realize how long this was!
0	My favorite game when I was about 10 was "Pokemon: Battle Colosseum". I seriously played that game just about everyday. One day I went to go play it, powered up the Nintendo Game Cube (where I'd last left the game), but all I got was the unrolling "G" icon—no game. Ah no big deal, I thought, it's probably in the case. Nope. A year went by of me asking my neighborhood friends if they'd borrowed it from me without asking, but all of them said no. Then, one day I was at a friend's house and noticed he had game I'd lost a year ago at this point. I told him that my copy was missing and had been for a year. A very familiarly-worn walkthrough guide to the game was on his shelf. With my initials on both. Apparently, he didn't even know they were mine, which I found hard to believe, understandably. I was  furious . Couldn't believe that my friend would've done that for me. At dinner that night I brought it up at the table, and told my parents that this kid had taken my game. My brother started laughing hysterically. Turns out he sold my copy of "Pokemon: Battle Colosseum" to my neighbor for $30, kept the cash for himself, and never told me. He even neglected telling the kid he sold it to that it was mine.
1	I can't play support that good.   Support is basically the only role you need to know how to play, to play ranked, as it's a basic backup role if you're in the lower pick part. Most of the time you can fall back on playing support if you didn't get your main role, but you can't fall back on mid because most of the time it's already taken.   Also the worst player gets forced to play support, so if you're a medicore support you can be sure that your enemy support will be bad...   You don't even need to know many champs, as many supports can be basically picked into every comp...
0	I'm convinced their is a witch hunt going on in my city for strawberry ice cream. Every store I go too, No Frills, Walmart, Target, Oceans, Rabba, Shoppers Drug-mart, there is NO BLOODY STRAWBERRY ICE CREAM. You know what a PISS OFF it is to go down the ice cream section and see: chocolate...vanilla...BLUEBERRY?!?! OH YOU LITTLE SHI-   Or worse lately is instead of pink = strawberry, pink = mixed berry or cherry. Fucking cherry, the leper of flavours. Nobody eats cherry lollipops or candies or anything, it's the reference point all flavours compare themselves to by measuring how much better they are than cherry. Yet like weeds they choke the space in grocery aisles until no room for strawberry ice cream remains.   The closest I can get is Neapolitan but it's just not the same. It haunts my dreams man.
1	Been watching some Korean streams and some stuff tends to be common. SKT Wolf seems to enjoy playing him.   Most start with the Spellthief's but later trade it for the Talisman. Obviously Sightstone because no explanation needed, hopefully. I've seen Ionian Boots but most go for Mobility Boots. Frozen Heart seems to be on  all  of them. Locket is a fairly common sight, too. I've seen Randuin's a fair deal as well, and the more utility-based people pick up Mikael's.
1	I'ma give you the rundown that I did on another thread a while back.   First off; Rylai's gives +80 Ability power, +500 HP, and a 35% slow (Only 15% on multi-target damage), and it costs 3105g.   Now then, champions like Katarina and Akali (the two I see Rylais with the most) are both snowball heroes. They have to get kills early and itemize effectively to properly snowball and scale into lategame.   Buying Rylai's as a 2nd item is not cost-efficient, especially on new Kat, because you pay 3105g for only +80 damage. Your whole objective is to do damage. The slow is almost unnoticeable on 3/4 of Kat's abilities (AoE).   Now Abyssal, costs 2650g offers +70 damage. You spend less money on equal damage because +70 damage + the passive. Another item is Zhonya's, which gives +100 damage. You get +20 more damage and a ridiculously strong passive for LESS gold.   Honestly, the best Kat build (I've found so far) would be Gunblade > Rabadon's > GA > Abyssal > Void Staff with Sorc Shoes sometime early on. You get tankiness, and the passive proc from GA, both of which you need because you're melee with most of your damage coming from melee range spells.   I know scarra goes Gunblade > Abyssal almost every game, but it's really a matter of opinion.
0	If there's one thing I've learned about relationships: establish your feelings on flirting right away when you start dating.   It's kind of a weird gray area where a lot of people are totally OK with their SO flirting, but a lot of others are VERY not OK with it. Personally, I don't mind if my boyfriend flirts with another girl when he goes out with his buddies. I drew a very specific line saying that as soon as she's trying to exchange phone numbers/facebook friendship, etc... that's where it stops. As long as he comes home to me at the end of the night, who cares? It boosts his ego which I think is good for dudes.   On the other hand, my boyfriend does not feel the same. He falls on the "very not OK" end of the scale. I asked him what his policy on flirting was as soon as we started dating and now I know that he's not OK with it like I am... so I don't do it, end of story.   It really comes down to a simple conversation early on in the relationship. Some people don't have problems with it, and as a result overlook the fact that their partner does. It doesn't mean that the person had a malicious intent... he/she may have just failed to acknowledge that their SO has a contradicting belief system. If you DO talk about your feelings regarding flirting and he/she does it anyway... then at least you KNOW that he/she was deliberately disrespecting you and they can't pull the "oh, I didn't know if bothered you" card.
0	After reading these comments there is just something I don't understand. If you're unattractive, and you know it...just stop trying until you are able or ready to fix the issue. I am a fat, unattractive guy. I don't attempt to date chicks. I know they won't be interested so there is no point in making them feel uncomfortable when they have to say no and there is no reason for me to feel let down when they do say no. You can be fat...that's ok. Just stop trying to have boyfriends/girlfriends while you are that way. I'm 28 and have only had 3 girlfriends ever for a total of about 3.5 years of my life. These 3 chicks I was friends with and to be honest they probably just dated me because i was "nice" and they didn't want to hurt my feelings or be mean. I just felt they were sympathy relationships not anything real. So the
1	When you're playing a game of baseball do you get out of the dugout and scream "Hahaha you suck just quit you loser!" to the opposing batter that just struck out?   When your opponent barely misses a putt that  would have put him ahead of you in a round of golf do you go "Wow you just failed so hard. Easy win."?   No? That's because it's universally accepted that showing humility in victory and grace in defeat (that should sound familiar, by the way) is the proper thing to do in sporting matches. Just because the anonymity of the internet allows you to get away with acting like a little prick doesn't make it right or acceptable. I'll be the first to admit that sometimes I've taunted, usually in response to earlier arrogant bragging, but stop acting like it might be okay to taunt the opposing team "strategically." It's not, and you know it's not, so don't try and coax an approval out of us to justify your immature behavior.
0	Whenever I drive to work, in a few blocks in my city one minority group ALWAYS crosses the street at the wrong time. I always think the worst things.   Then I drive a few blocks, and a certain US Majority group crosses the street illegally and I have to stop, and I feel bad for thinking pretty crappy things earlier in the drive. It's pretty humbling, actually.
1	Let me start off by saying I think the idea of the snowball is a great change.  However I must bring up an issue I've found and improvement suggestions...   Tanks (especially Galio/Sion/Alistar) weren't that bad before if you played with a more passive playstyle to get items.  Late game tank teams were actually ridiculously strong but it was kind of hard to get to that point against full rape poke comps.. especially with Udyr or Eve.  I believe this change was catered mainly to champs like Udyr/Eve, but overbuffed the fuck out of the tanks that were already good.   For example, Galio was already top 5 highest winrate champions in ARAM before snowball.  Now he can ult you from across the map and you are never safe to group up while it's off CD.  People say mark/dash balances the game type but I've won all of over ~5 Galio games since the change with ridiculous KDAs.   And the cooldown is so low on mark/dash that the opposite of old ARAM is starting to happen:  poke/squishy comps are getting decimated by comps with tanks.  You pretty much lose a teamfight if one of the engage tanks lands a snowball, and they can keep trying every ~20 seconds.
1	Yes, but after that I lost all hopes in Riot if they ever gonna ban anyone. Also back in the day was glitch with Mobile RP, it wasn't so popular but as well, no one got banned. Basically from what I've "learned" -> lots of people stole from them -> no consequences at all, while they said they gonna ban everyone who abused it. Also I feel bad myself that I didn't use that glitch, my friends got over 60k RP on every account... That's why I completely don't trust Riot anymore, when they say they gonna ban anyone anymore. Tribunal bans are automatic, but perma ban isnt.
1	not too long ago a friend of mine quit lol and gave me his acc. it was bronze 2. my main is currently gold 5 so im not that good of a player. all i can say to you is that u need to able to play midlane. from my POV mid is the lane that will help u to snowball the game the hardest. i've played panth mid most of my games and had lots of succes. that acc is currenly silver 2 i think, i was able to get out of bronze in a few days just by playing singed and panth. u need to snowball games. u need to literally carry 1v5. otherwise u relly on ur team mates. pick hyper carrys as ryze, vayne, singed, panth or riven and bitchslap other players. edit:sry 4 my english.
0	Shit,  I spend 4 bucks on a cannister of cooking oil that coupled with tortillas and maybe some veggies. I have good tasting food for like 2 weeks for 12$-15$ and for snacks a box of costco ramen which is like 5$ for a pack of 25-30.   However if I go for less fat I usually just get a box of those Weight Watchers chicken patties, pan fry em' and fold the tortilla's around the chicken.(4-ish points if you are keeping track)   This may be just preference but I tend to keep away from packaged meats since they only last for about one or two days after the first portion is cooked. Oh and since I try to stay away from fast food I get can's of tuna and shredded cheese and melt them in a small pan (drain tuna first) the smell of them cooking is enough to keep my mind off of food (as I both hate and love the smell).   Now when I do this in front of my roomates or company (the chicken or tuna) They look down upon me. To which I respond: "Go spend 20$ at Five Guys for one night of good eats I'll be busy spending all this extra money on Riot points and strippers!"
1	I see the OP's point, but I believe people (generally) tend to be a better than this kind of behavior. In this case, all that matters is the general or average, since you need super majority. Of course you will get people doing stupid shit in the system. However, people that don't regularly vote in the majority lose their privileges and so over time the idiots will weed themselves out with their own nonsense. Quite fitting when you think about it.   Also, unless you actually are bad enough to get reported regularly by people who are so pissed with how bad you are that they are reporting you, you have nothing to worry about. (A respondent already stated it would take a significant amount of reports to wind up on trial). Further on the same point, let's all ask ourselves a question and being brutally honest: "Would you really care, if the people that are SO BAD that even though they are trying their best to win, get wrongfully convicted of intentional feeding and are removed from the game?"   To me, whether its done intentionally, or because the person is just that bad, the effect on others is the same. The baddie is still ruining games. The only difference is, the intentional feeder is a disruptive asshole, instead of just disruptive.   Besides, bad people tend to get put in <1000 elo brackets, where reporting for being bad is probably less common anyway.   In my opinion, Riot's job is to provide the best gaming experience for the maximum number of people. If 500,000 people have their gaming experiences improved by say 5-10% as a result of this, and a few hundred are removed from the system (fairly or unfairly) this seems like a good outcome to me.

1	With Fnatic, though, it's cos they lack focus imo. At knockouts and season-deciding games, they always beat everyone (both season of LCS, IPL6, Worlds, etc)   All the things that people have inferred from LCS performance (Gambit and Fnatic inconsistent, etc) can pretty much be put down to one sad fact: the league doesn't really matter. Top 2 is great, top 6 is fine. Nobody really cares whether they're 3rd or 6th, if they back themselves in the knockouts (which teams like Gambit and Fnatic always do) then the league really doesn't matter to them.   Gambit really picked it up at the end of last season, which might make you think "they really wanted to climb the table!" but imo they just realised coming outside top 6 was a genuine risk, so they won some games. Same with TSM, to a lesser extent. Anyway I'm rambling....
1	It's nice to see riot are trying new things but shouty black guy's
1	It forces teams to turn away good coaches that they want to work with, because few teams are going to throw away that much money.   what you're saying is that they are good coaches, just not good enough to give up $25,000 RIOT money?  OK   >Stage-presence is nothing to do with being a coach,   You're right- it has to do with marketing RIOT's product, League of Legends within their main marketing vehicle- the LCS.   > Riot shouldn't say they're paying coaches and then only honour it when they get a show out of it. I don't see why it's unreasonable for Riot to pay remote coaches such as LS a salary.   Because it's their money and they should do whatever they want with it.  The LCS is about marketing League of Legends.  I'd imagine affable, visible personalities on the pro scene help accomplish this task.  If LS is such a great coach, a team with sign him with their own funds.   >I don't think Riot should be forcing teams into decisions where it's a bad choice for them to work with the coaches they want to use.   I don't think you understand what FORCE means. RIOT is not forcing MYM to do anything.  They and other LCS teams are lucky RIOT decided to offer support staff subsidies in the first place.  They are forcing MYM to use their own funds to hire staff that can't make an appearance at LCS events.
1	10 teams playing 3 games still results in more games, if every team has to play 1 less game that doesn't mean there are less games total because there is more teams, 2 teams can play at once so for every team to play one game you need 5 games. for every team to play 27 times you need 27*5 games which is 135. 135 is more than 112.
1	your the one who is correct. everyone else in this thread doesn't know what they are saying. it is true that malphite misjudged the range. and it is true that regardless of the charm or not, he would not have hit anything. HOWEVER, malphite's ult animation does show after it hits, whether or not it hits anything. that is clearly not shown in the video that you posted, simply because his ult never landed due to being charmed by the ahri.
1	It could also be that, generally speaking,  the little shits that play in America (The XBOX Live CoD, ages 13-21 Crowd), have absolutely no sense of self responsibility and self criticism and those players are the vast majority of league of legends players.  None of this Hyperactive-ADD-Monster-Fueled game style exists in Korea.   The American teenagers are used to a mostly anonymous and cycling matchmaking system where, honestly, it "doesn't matter" if you respect your team mates or not, because the Call of Duty Arcade-Style Shooter has that type of style where in public matches of CoD individual performances of the players culminate in the victory or defeat of the team.  There is no real co-operation and team work in team deathmatch and conquest.   That attitude fostered by the Arcade Shooter style has carried over to LoL and other games that they play and they get butt blasted.   They do not have respect for their team mates as fellow players and people and believe that they exist solely for the gain of the individual player.   Then, because they are so poorly socialized and 1) do not know how to handle themselves in a multiplayer game, 2) do not know how to communicate their feelings and 3) can not recognize their own mistakes, they go into the more and more prevalent  "autistic rage."  It is called autistic rage because they are do very little to communicate the issue at hand and only communicate the displeasure as a result of those issues.
1	You CAN carry but I recommend not playing full tank junglers that only provide cc and no actual dmg (especially not low elo. I consider pre dia 4 low elo). If you want to hard carry games as a jungler I would suggest playing actual carry junglers like Vi, Shyvana, Nocturne, Udyr, etc. In that way you are able to carry soloq games by prioritizing farming and lvl's early game. That way you are:  1) 2/3 lvl's ahead of the enemy jungler 2) 1/2 items ahead of the enemy junglers   I also tend to go more offensive when im ahead (e.g. 3 or 4/0 at 20 minuts). IF you play AD/bruiser junglers and you go like: warrior into botrk into bc and then full tank. I garantee you shit on the enemy cinderhulk jungler. Also when playing sth like vi you are able to almost 1 shot enemy carries with ult and some spells/aa's. After you take out their "carries" you can start killing their tanks with ur botrk active and armor pen.
0	I have, and I have made plans to go back, but as of right now they haven't worked. When I dropped out of school I forfeited on the terms of my scholarship, leaving me in a lot of debt. Shortly after, I chose to marry, had 2 kids and then realized she was crazy. Throughout our marriage and subsequent divorce she found wonderful and fun ways to put me into even more debt. Fast forward 6 years of retail management and child support and I am just now getting to the bottom of all of that debt and mess. Couple that with the fact that I technically make too much for any grants, my credit is way too screwed for any loans, and I work in retail with no reimbursement or plans for education and it makes going back exceedingly difficult.
1	He said he got tired of the competitive scene and the pressure and whatnot.
1	Saying "his mmr shouldn't be low" is pretty relative. The system does indeed suck because it makes you feel like you can't rise when in fact you are. Even though he lost 14 he lost the same amount of mmr that he gained with 1 win. Mmr works just like the old elo system.
1	Why are there so many pissy children complaining about "oh I dont like his videos,  WHY DO YOU LIKE THEM YOU MUST BE STUPID" its a video, for fun, for entertainment. Stop being mad about something that has no effect on anything.
0	I can't count how many times I have seen this exact situation play out with my friends who just assume the reason they didn't get the job was because of their race. When the same thing happens to my white friends they have a whole different list of reasons for why they didn't get the job, but ultimately, black or white, they all boil down to the same thing: they didn't get the job and they are dead certain it was for some reason other than their impeccable qualifications which clearly anyone can see.
0	Actually, something very similar happened to my brother in law recently, but ended with a twist.  He works at the express service station of a Dodge dealership, recently the station had gotten hit with a bad review by 2 different customers, so the boss decided it was time to get rid of the less motivated employees (I suppose).  He called the entire staff of the station into his office and told all of them he was permanently shutting down the station, transferring the mechanics to work in other departments, and letting the techs go.  After saying this he turns to the 4 techs and informs them that they can take a demotion washing cars at lower pay, otherwise he cant keep them.  They all initially agree to stay and wash cars, and get started with their first assignment, wash all the cars on the lot.  Within one hour, the laziest employee returned and quit.  At the end of the second day the boss called everyone back into his office, informed them he was not actually closing the express stop, had them all return to their original jobs, he gave all 3 techs a raise and gave my brother in law the biggest raise because he was the only one who washed cars without complaining, "Just got out there and got work done".
1	It's not as simple as that though. You can't just look at the surface and make a call based only on that. What is the deeper issue causing the Western scene to fall short every time it counts? The simple answer is, as most things in life, money. These Telecom and Electronics companies have been taking Esports MUCH more seriously in Korea than any organization anywhere else bar-none. They expect results and when they don't get them they change the status quo untill they find something that works. You hear all the time how rutheless organizations are in Korea about changing players in and out.
0	Total myth -- for adult males there is absolutely zero medical evidence that circumcision prevents UTIs.  Probably some reduced risk of certain infections, but the majority of the studies were very poorly controlled and the evidence is controversial.   There is some evidence that circumcision reduces the risk of UTI in infants [Pubmed link]( but the key message from the abstract is:   Systematic reviews have shown that circumcision reduces the risk of repeat infection but 111 circumcisions would need to be performed to prevent one UTI in unpredisposed boys. Given the need for anaesthesia and the risk of surgical complication, net clinical benefit is probably restricted to those who are predisposed (such as those with recurrent infection).   Moreover, there is actually some [evidence that circumcision drives UTIs in infants](   A nice, easy to read review can be found [here](   I've had the pleasure of having a string of UTIs in my late 20s (male) and the first thing my doctor wanted to do was cut me.  Being a scientist, I insisted on seeing the relevant data, and it turned out there was none.  Got a new doctor after that.
0	Yeah. That's not accurate. It wasn't a movie that I would want to see again but it wasn't about shopping. Was it terrible? Yes, but the main characters are dealing with aging and trust issues. The beginning of the movie was so cheesy it was painful. If you are saying that because they are constantly in different outfits they are encouraging materialism then I won't argue with you. That's not what you said though.   I can't believe I just wrote something defending Sex and the City 2.   Anyway, Transformers is the written by 14 year olds for 13 year olds. I'll admit I enjoyed the first one but I'll also admit I was high out of my mind when I saw it. Transformers 2 was one of the worst major releases I've ever seen. I liked Transformers cartoons as a kid so it's not like I have something against the brand. My roommate in college thought it was the best movie of that summer so I tried to avoid picking on it so I wouldn't hurt his feelings so now I make fun of it whenever I get the chance. Such is life on the internet.   Seriously though, when John Turturro looked up and saw giant robot balls they should have played this [noise](   EDIT: I wonder if Transformers is written by 14 year olds for 17 year olds? You know, like they are trying to show the big kids how cool they are with explosions, weird thumb girl and cars? We've gotten so far away from where we started. The original point I was making was just that the two franchises are on different levels in terms of maturity of content. Sex and the City may be cheesy but at least occasionally some real issues are discussed.
1	While i like Cloud 9 as a team, that's a bit of a bold statement "World Meta", above all people should understand how meta folds:     Champion 1 is buffed   Champion 1 becomes significally more effective to play   Champion 1 got some advantage at some point of game which deems him op, because people have no clue how to deal with that (yet)   Players seek similar champions to Champion 1 and build them alike   More and more people recognize it's popularity, meta towards certain playstyle is formed, boosted by similar new champion releases     Often the simple solution to break meta is is take one factor what forms it, and negate it's effects. Funny thing is, often it results in using dated solutions, but sometimes it's THE counter to meta at hand.   I mean, look at Koreans doing that Double AD, with Ezreal being mid. Is this new? No, it's ancient, Ezreal was a very very popular mid before ranked games even existed. Except the difference is... That Ezreal was worked towards becoming AD over these years, and the recent addition to many on-hit effects such as frozen gauntlet, muramana's active and BotRK makes his key ability (Mystic Shot, Q) a deadly, long range poking ability, basically doing everything you want, a good chunk of damage, damage based on health, armor shred, slow etc. all that with low cooldown and mana cost. Recycled strategy to counter strategy at hand.   Now now you may ask, how does that have anything to do with C9?   Simple, C9 uses the "meta" or the compositions that excel at pushing (wave clear, burst damage, steroids of all kind).   It was developed during s2 actually (yes it was the asian region). Since they didn't have access to LoL as early as NA/EU, their mechanical skills weren't as good as NA and EU for example. They were constantly behind in cs (go look if you don't believe) BUT they had champions with global presence, such as Shen, TF etc... They could turn fights un-even at any given time early on which allowed them to create pushing situations, since NA teams were prone to their cs and "farming", they sort of let that happen. Result? Loss.   Also the fact that asian regions (and m5) were under this shroud of darkness. No-one knew how they play, but they knew everything about the popular, streaming teams. Which led those (asian/m5) teams to do something, now called as "cheesing". They had a hunch what they could be playing, result - loss during bans/picks, using strategies that may result in a win once/twice or as long as the enemy doesn't realize what they're dealing with.   Take recent game of EG vs Fnatic for an example   Froggen played Twitch Mid, did Fnatic know how effective it is? No. Did they know how to counter or react to it, however? Yes. Result was poor laning phase for Froggen, but over-all a win for EG because they "cheesed"   And they aren't in this shroud anymore, they constantly display their tactics, strategies in national tournaments. I do believe C9 has a good chance to win due to the amount of homework LemonNation does for them (unless during those last games, one of the teams whips out something completely new). But i think "World Meta" is a funny wording for it.
0	To be fair, some of those override flushing buttons are not in any way shape or form intuitive. There's no consistency and there's no obvious indications. It's sometimes a simple black protrusion next to another black piece of plastic on a metal panel on the wall, sometimes it's a chrome button on the side of a chrome fixture that could just as well be a bolt or some protrusion of the flushing mechanism.   Those are obvious to those who have experience with them, but unless you grew up with them, you are probably forgetting an event where you were like "WTF, how the hell does this god damn toilet work".
1	Is it just me or is this a total dick thing to say? Translation....   One minute: "oh wow he didn't even get the simple stuff right"   Two minute: "omg there is 1 hour and 46 minutes"   "
0	English is my first language and Italian is my second. People usually think I'm relatively funny when I speak English (Australians seem to really find me funny for some reason). However, when I speak Italian people seldom if ever find me funny. The only people who get my Italian jokes are my family (all Americans with Italian as a second language).
0	I saw a posted image today for the first time. (Fire distinguisher)  OP was torn a new one for the repost.   10 minutes later, I'm looking at dogstandingupinhisboxtoeat.gif for the umpteenth time and the commenters are gushing over the sweetness and awwww-someness.
0	While undergraduate education is  typically  billed as a four-year experience, many students, particularly at public universities, actually take five, six or even more years to attain a degree."   I briefly sifted through the Dept. of Ed. statistics, but I'm just going to say this -- if 60% of students get their degree within 6 years, it's likely that the other 40% have dropped out.  I don't have the numbers, but I think the percentage of those students that receive a degree more than 6 years after entry is probably not too great.  So, you have 40% of all undergraduates getting their degree within 4 years, and 60% doing it within 6.  If we assume that those are the only ones that receive degrees, then 2/3 of graduating students did it within 4 years and 1/3 did it in either 5 or 6.  Now you see what I mean?   Of course, there are students that receive a degree after 7 or 8 or 9 years, but it's not the remaining 40% or probably even 10%.
1	Yeah I mean orianna is a sort of skilled matchup when it comes against a lot of champs. I can say that I have never gone against a Diana but I can handle Akali's pretty well so I can't imagine Diana being too much harder. And yeah the mana problem is usually solved with preserving mana when farming, and when Diana initiates, kite with W and auto attacks to trade. But like I've said, I've never gone against a Diana so I wouldn't know ori's potential against her. Also ori could run heal for even more defensive kiting against Diana which could easily lead to a kill. So I'm just kinda babbling about he matchup but
1	Honestly, if you want to get to a higher Elo, play roles/champions you're good at and stop trying to acquiesce to the people on your team. That's not to say rage or be one of those people who says "x or feed", make an active effort to try and get the role you're best at, but if you can't, go for your second or third best and so on.
1	actually 100 armor essentially extends your survival to the damage type by another full hp bar's worth. Hence if he went from 5 bars (the base hp, and 4 extra bars worth from 400 armor) to 1.9 (the hp and .9 from armor).   he ended up at abit less than 40% of his "expected" effective health.
0	That's because that's not the first time, or the dozenth, that they've had to say that in the last twenty minutes.  It looks unreasonable because that's the first one you've seen, but in reality it's been a long unending stream of kid-babble that  never ends  and you have to keep telling them to stop yelling because children have no volume control at all.  It gets so all you want is just ten uninterrupted minutes of quiet and so you wind up saying it a little to loud or forcefully, only to have people with no children give you the stinkeye like you're a horrible person for yelling at your kid.
1	Their stlye improved. Also of course the dominated the Lcs in the first couple weeks. C9 was rusty form the lose of Hai, Tsm's roster was unstable till playoffs, CLG was being ClG, DIG was their only competition early. LMQ was the only good team at the start of the season with a roster with significant practice together. From watching them over the season and the NACS it is obvious that they evolve from an average Chinese team with nonstop aggressive play to a more varyed play style with both agression and macro game.
0	I'm sincerely glad to hear that op and most of these other posters still have their family members despite them being diagnosed with something as fatal as cancer. But the number of posts on this thread that contain the words 'battle' and 'victory' underscores what I think is a particularly insidious and harmful phenomenon that has permeated mainstream thought on the subject. Look, it sucks when people get sick, and it sucks even worse than they die. But the implication that this involves competitions with winners and losers is offensive to the memory of every 'loser' and their surviving loved ones, who don't need to hear that their beloved dead just 'lost,' as if they might have lived had they tried harder.   It is difficult enough to accept the death of a loved one without the metaphor of winners and losers. Be glad your loved ones survived, and I am sincerely glad for you. But realize that your mother's 'victories' imply that a whole lot of folks are just not trying hard enough, which is absurd and harmful.
0	Technically true, But takes a lonnngo time. To breathe enough pure helium to die completely you would either have to strap on a mask for several minutes while your brain fails due to lack of oxygen, or be in a sealed room till eventually the same thing happens. It's painless because you still feel like you're breathing. Your lungs register the same stimulus as breathing air, but there is no oxygen that transfers into the hemoglobin of the blood and you get the same symptoms as oxygen deprivation. First you black out, then asphyxiate but without actually feeling it.
0	Fair questions   1) if you create a limited audio file (heavily compressed) you cannot uncompress it... so there isn't a possible way to do it the other way around, but I see your point... this is why television compresses so hard, because they want to appeal to the masses and everything to be on an even level (radio too)   2) your dvd does have compression, just nothing like what you see on TV... and blu-ray is an even bigger lack of compression. let's talk about it in terms of your music purchases:   When you buy an MP3, the codec is taking a WAV file and making it from about 12 megs to about 3 megs, right? Well to do that, it has to remove a lot of information, so what it does is take all the lowest of lows and highest of highs (audibly speaking) and squishes it together so it fits like a nice even tube of tooth paste... while this works well for sending files and listening in ear buds, it doesn't fare so well for car stereos or worse (DJ equipment, etc).... and once you have turned something into an MP3, you cannot undo it back to wav... sure you can convert back to wav physically, but the damage is done... the new wav file will look like the same 12 meg file, but it's actually the 3 meg file just stretched out to SEEM like its 12 megs...   The reason we have dynamic range is simple... emotion... films were never meant to be watched while feeding your baby or doing the dishes... While I can understand and agree to some point that there should be a better explanation for the masses or perhaps a one click button that compresses everything, but this isn't done (i'm assuming) because it's like saying "thanks for the hard work audio guys... now suck it"   Do you pirate movies? You'll notice that the most common codec right now for HD downloads is under 2 gigs.... 2 gigs!!!! A dual layer blu-ray can handle 50 gigs of space.... you are squashing that 25x to make it more accessible for pirates.
0	Fun facts:   In the olden days (think the Renaissance), fat was considered attractive because only the well-to-do had the time, money, and resources to foster some chub.  Fast forward to the 21st century and we find slender, athletic builds attractive because it's mostly the well-to-do who have the time, money, and resources to maintain that type of figure.
0	Have to be very blunt here. I'd have mad respect for anyone serious about trying to lose weight and become healthy. What I loathe is the 'new years resolution' people. They aren't serious, it's a fad. If they really wanted to better themselves they would have been in the gym weeks/months before not waiting for a specific day as the starting line.
1	The way how I managed to crawl out was I spammed only one champion, which was Thresh. How did I improve? Best thing that I did was also when I grouped normals with my plat/gold friends was after each teamfight, doesn't matter if we won it or lost it, broke it down as to what went good and what went bad and proceeded on from there.   I like what the top comment said as well "learn from outside of ranked as much as possible." For real, learning Thresh I watched Xpecial, Aphro, and Zekent play for a long time. I studied how they moved, when they warded, engaging/disengaging, peeling, etc. This doesn't mean "VOYBOY PLAYED AP YASUO MUST TRY THIS LELELE" No. Don't copy their builds or attempt their next level plays because that shit doesn't work every time. That's one play out of a million that will, most likely, not be replicated again. Just study their movements, the game flow and the calls being sent out (when to baron/drag, ganks, etc) and just take notes and apply it to normals first.   That's all I got
1	The champions that dont fit the meta are that way because they are countered by particular things but they also have things they do better than other champions, and this is how the game worked for a long time, champion a counters champion b with x ability but if you can protect champion a from b then champion a can do a lot.   For example, Cassiopeia is countered by champions that can lock her down easily, since she has no escape and is extremely squishy. However she excels at sustained damage if you can keep her safe over that time. Galio excels at keeping the enemy team locked down with his ultimate but is countered by champions with stuns or silences on their autoattacks (ever ulted a bear stance udyr?) so Galio needs to wait for the opportune moment to ult.   The problem is that at the moment there are other champions that do what these champions used to do without the inherent weaknesses.   Riot should buff these champions in the direction of their niche. Eg. Each cassiopeia E doing progressively more damage to a target or per use. Manage to keep her safe and you win the fight. Or make her base movement speed higher instead (snakes are fast bro) so she can dodge skillshots and run away from ganks better or poke down her opponent more effectively.   For Galio you could make it so that his ult makes him immune to autoattack enhance effects and then balance it around that.   Maybe I'm just talking out of my ass, but the only way to get these niche picks back in the game is to make them the best at doing what they do.   These niche champions have counterplay that makes the game exciting and dynamic, there should be more effort put into balancing them. Mistakes in balance changes can be undone but if nothing is done nothing changes.   edit:
1	Well seeing as the infraction happened between 2  AMERICAN  teams and riot games is located in  NORTH AMERICA  your suggestion wouldn't happen. In the NFL, NBA, MLB, and NHL no team can offer a contract or position on their team while they're under contract with another. That's what free agency is for. Hell, if Dignitas had made worlds this year and your suggestion was in effect, who couldn't say that he's not distracted by a team offering him a contract for next season while he's trying to prepare his team for a major tournament?
1	Leona in lane hits 3 powerspikes at levels 2, 3, and 6.   For the first spike, what this means is you need to hard push your lane and hit level 2 earlier than leona does. If she zenith/stuns you while you're only level 1, it will at the very least, burn you through your pots, and then she's just going to all in you again once off cd.   If you hit level 2 first, try and all in her. If you at least burn leona or her ADC down to half health and keep them there, she definitely won't go in on you before she has shield, and even when she gets it, she'll still play passive until it's stronger when she hits levels 4-5.   If both lanes are relatively equal, you need to keep her bush warded starting the minion before she hits 3 so you can keep an eye on her. A full QWE combo out of the bush with an ADC that can proc all 3 passives could probably kill you, or send you out of lane and start it snowballing away from you.   Understand that leona is all-in with 0 sustain. That's it. Which means if she can't all in you because she's or her ADC are lower in health, abuse them and don't give them time to recover. In line with that, If leona  does  all in you, watch how many of her passives the opposing ADC procs. If they're synced enough that they pop all three, GTFO. If the ADC is late following up and only one gets popped, Switch the aggression around. Those passive procs account for a bit of leonas threat, and if the ADC misses 2/3 of them, thats 70-100 damage they missed out on. Now, if you and your supp go ham on the other adc since leona no longer has any peel or burst, you may actually come out ahead. Just remember, leona's combo is ~10s cd. If you're still skirmishing when that comes off, it will turn the fight back around.   Be aware, if you're in range to AA Leona (unless cait/kog/trist), she can probably get a zenith blade off onto you. Its best to harass her with skillshots if you can, and only with AA's with your supports skills off CD in case she all-ins you.   When Leona hits 6, she  will  go all in on you. Do not stay in lane without your support. Do not count on your tower saving you. Giving up some CS/XP/Tower to wait for jungle/support so you don't die is far better than giving up all 3 + a kill. The Range on her ult is approximately 3/4 of a screen away, so even if you think you're safe, you're probably not. At 6, If you can see her on your screen, she's a threat.   Ultimately though, Leona isn't countered by ADC's. The other support is what shuts down Leona. I climbed from low silver to Gold 1 (Plat soon, hopefully) on leona's back, and the only time I really had problems was seeing a Janna or Ali on the other team. A good Janna will ruin Leona's world, and I mean shit all over it like a puppy with diarrhea. Ali will make Leona second-guess every all in since she requires her adc to follow up. An Ali headbutting away the enemy adc when Leona goes in just leaves a stuck Leona getting beaten in the face.   After Lane phase is over, you need to make Banshee's Veil a priority. I  will  aim for you with R. If I hit it, the team is coming for you. Know that.   And this is just advice for all champs in general, but if leona is behind, she has a really hard time catching up. If she can't survive going all in, then most of her usefulness to the team if negated.
0	Classic. The first time I saw one in person it was very special for me. I was about 13 and I was with this girl that I really liked. Both of our families were close and we all went on a hiking trip. Well she wasn't having too much fun because about a week before, she had sprained her ankle playing soccer, so she stayed behind for the most part. I went with them for awhile but after about half an hour I got tired, then bitches and moaned until my mom let me go back to the camp. At that point I had totally forgotten about that girl and I had also forgotten which rent was mine. Well I walked into her tent and she was half way undressed. Being the wimp I was back then, I immediately scurried out of there. As I cowered in fear outside of the tent I heard her say "Wait, come back in here!" So I did just that and she looked me dead in the eyes and said "Let's do it." I didn't even know what to do but I was so excited that I just threw everything off except my underwear. She also got undressed but being as excited as I was, I thought I'd help her. I started to pull off her pants when she stopped me and whispered in my ear "Before we do it, I'm gonna need something." I replied emphatically "Yes, anything of course!" She looked me in the eye with a seductive look and said ".....imma need bout tree fiddy." That's when I realized that she was actually a 5-story tall crustacean from the Paleozoic era.
1	I personally chalk it up to the difference in how i acted as a teenager as to how current teenagers now act, im 24 now when i was 13-16 playing cs:s/wow ALOT the community was a hell of a lot nicer but nowadays kids are complete utter little shits, just my personal opinion on why its like that.   I may be completely wrong who knows..
1	Years of terrible solo queue experience here in d3-4, let me try and shed some light on this.   Baron is a really dangerous objective to do. It requires that everyone be on the same page. People often have different views on how to handle a baron situation.   For example if 4 people are killing baron and the enemy jungler flashes in to try to steal at 3k HP on the baron the correct move would be to instantly turn on the jungler and kill him to not risk the steal, but others will often panic and continue to attack the baron and then you don't get the kill nor the baron.   Also, baron works with certain compositions. If the enemy team has good ad waveclear and/or you have bad seige a baron buff won't do much other than giving you a temporary stat boost that you'll lose after they turtle for 3 minutes. A dragon helps push the game to end because a 5 dragon team usually can simply tower dive 5v5 and still win. An inhibitor would give super minions and allow you to seige 5v5 by rotating to another part of the map.
0	Hmmm... my wife is kind of the opposite of your SO.   At christmas a few years back, we visited my parents.  She  was in charge of packing the christmas presents for the trip and when we arrived she discovered, to her own "horror", that she'd forgotten my present to her.  It was a small package, she  knew  it contained jewelry of some sort.   Gallant husband as I am, I made a last minute shopping for a new gift just to make sure she didn't spend christmas with all my family and didn't receive anyting from me. I guess I figured she could always get the first one later.   Then, at the time of opening the presents, the first present kind of miraculously appeared inside her purse, leaving her with two presents from me for christmas. It's still a tale that is repeated at every family gathering...

0	Here is some sound advice while driving to avoid road rage. First of all, realize that you, yes you, are not alone in this world, and that you are not the only person that has to be somewhere at this time. Everyone, everywhere, has places to go. So when a car pulls out in front of you and you think, I have somewhere to be! well...so does that person. And honestly, did that person really pull out in front of you? Did you really have to slam on your brakes to avoid a collision? I doubt it. Secondly, put on some relaxing tunes. It's hard to be in a bad mood when you are singing along to some Britney Spears. Take your time. This is important. Now, it is one thing if you really are running super late and you might get in trouble for being late, but if you will be fine, don't rush! When you rush yourself, you will cause yourself anxiety and anguish. These feelings will then perpetuate themselves, because now you have road rage. When you have road rage, and start driving like a dick, you will cause others anguish, in turn causing them some road rage. That perpetuates from there, soon there are 100 road raging dicks sharing the road with you, and now you have an unpleasant commute. Seriously, most of the people that I have rode with that have road rage...they are the ones driving like a dick. They are the ones that feel entitled to the road and think they are the only ones with a place to be. I drive the speed limit, over if traffic allows for it. I take my time, I don't rush, and I never get road rage. Guess what...never been in a wreck (that I didn't cause) either! Seriously people, you are not the only ones who use the roads and have some place to be.
1	I used to support all the time. It was fun, exciting, and you could really fudge up with enemy's minds by warding everything. Now, on the other hand, I wand to try out other champions... I slowly started playing Nidalee as AP. Then learned to mid with Annie, and then Veigar. After that, pretty much any champ that comes to my hands can be.. well.. I'm decent in any champ, even if it's my first time playing with him. Same goes for AD, and for Top.
1	You must be new...   its a very common and OLD joke. Since the game is called Legend of Zelda people would assume that the name of the main character is Zelda not Link, hence referring to Link as Zelda.
1	she was already maybe 3rd or 4th best ad. the nerfs were totally unneeded. what with people starting to finally realize that sona is op and that soraka is a very weak laner, people are figuring out as well how hard it is for vayne to be in a good lane.   "people" calling a champ "useless" is more often than not a 1200 player making a post on gd and getting upvotes from other 1200 players.   before the patch vayne could just be in a farm lane and still do crazy damage, but now even more, it looks like you either need to go for a kill lane bot, or just pick sivir.
1	Another part of the answer is that ending the League wouldn't fully remove our ties to it in terms of storytelling – characters will have still interacted with it in the past, the “fall” of the League would still be significant enough to deeply influence all of our champions' lives, and “summoners” would still be a dangling, confusing story piece we'd have to deal with somehow.   The way I read this is the League, Institute of War, and Summoners will be still be canon but once the lore gets expanded in the right direction, all these things will literally be a thing of the past. The character's lore will be told from a point after the League has lost its value and Runterra goes back to good old fashioned war. If this is the case I'm actually really fine with how the new lore is being handled as the terms of Summoner, League, Institute of War will still remain intact and we don't have to worry about things like bleeping out the word summoner from every champion in the game.
1	So basically every Champion who ignores unit collision can walk through his Ultimate   i just tried that with a friend of mine, once hecarim with and without PD (that way i wouldnt waste my time, since you can apply pd's UC-ignore to everyone). he couldnt move through the ult
0	I want to come clean. I originally made this meme because I really do hear people say "conversate" a lot, but I too fell victim to using this word that is actually not a word. I remember like it was yesterday.... I was talking to someone, I used "conversate" in a sentence and they politely corrected me. Initially I felt embarrassed about my mistake but then almost immediately I felt relieved because it was in that moment that I knew I would never screw up when using the word converse ever again. It was like a stranger came up to me to tell me "Hey, I don't want to make this weird but you have a booger on your face. Just thought I would let you know because I would have wanted someone to do the same for me..." That brave stranger is a life saver in my book.
1	Just some thoughts on their first rental move/decision   With all his plans for LoL, I thought that the first things you could rent would be skins or champions. Even though Grandpa Teemo didn't address this iirc in any of his forum posts, it's been in sorta high demand from the community. After announcing champion/skin trial rentals and the reasoning behind it, then announcing this ward skin thing a couple of days later would seem like a better option. Not trying to say what Riot should do, but I would have liked to see this.
0	Happened to me, too. Teacher marked down half of every problem because I didn't show work so I talked to her after class asking what exactly she wanted me to show. She assumed that I had another sheet I was using that I threw away after the test. I solved a couple problems right in front of her, proving I didn't skip any steps, and she didn't care after that.
0	This opinion seems hella repugnant and callous. What did someone else being fat ever do to you? Was your puppy sat on by somebody's careless giant butt? If so, fuck you cause that puppy wasn't going to last long regardless of what sat on it and you shouldn't hold on to that anger. Look at it this way, If I'm a fat bastard the only thing that's going to affect is my own damn self. Too big to sit in one airline seat? I'll have to buy a second. Too out of shape to play a fun sport for extended periods of time with the gang? Bummer, I guess I'll just sit out for now. Fat people understand that an opportunity cost exists with eating so much. Being fat isn't anyone's problem but their own for the most part and if the specific fat people are cool with it then that's all there is to say about it. If they were encouraged to get fit by positive people that weren't full of projected hate I think that would be super rad but, you shouldn't make it your duty to inflict psychological damage to others cause they are totally unfuckable in your eyes. (I'm assuming this is something on a shallow level of looks because I doubt your passion for making fat people feel bad comes from a place of compassion for their health.) A lot of people suffer mental health issues because they are ashamed of the way they look and because they fear the way others perceive them, I think that's fucked up. I think shitheads like you should take a second to realize just how low you are behaving as people when other's feels of self worth are lowered because you don't like their appearance.   In regards to the fact that fat peoples' medical bills affect all of us; this is true, you got me there. let's inflict mental damage on fat people as penance for their folly, that's totally reasonable guys. Homeless people are a burden to the tax payer as well so we should just arrest them, oh no wait... we'd still pay for them, instead let's just murder them. Same with criminals!  they're on the country's dime and they've clearly proven they are not fit to be treated with dignity. The old and infirm can stay if they payed into Medicare but we got no room for orphans or the mentally ill as I can see it.
1	One thing that I realized that seems to help is to Assess and Reassess. As a jungler you are in the prime position to do this. When you are in champ-select look at your team comp.   Think about your strengths and weaknesses. How will your early game be? Which lanes will be problematic? What does your team bring to the table? Are you a poke comp, team fight, perhaps you need to catch someone off guard to truly have the advantage. What about the enemy team? How is their early game? How is their late game? And their team compositon?  Now you have to form a plan on how to exploit your strength and the enemies weakness. As a jungler you have the most control over this. Perhaps camp bot and mid but leave top on an island? Maybe you should counter jungle more. Focus solely on shutting mid down to deny them being a greater threat later on? Now what about you? What are you planning? Are you the tank? Are you going to be the killer? Now, think, do you need to have that? Do you need more damage? Do you need more beef? Coincide with the team and not the greed.   After every action think of what just happened. Personally I think out-loud and say things to myself. Here is an example: I just ganked mid. Did they see me coming? No. Did we kill them? No. Did you at least make contact? Yes. Did we burn a summoner spell? Yes. Which one? Flash.   Now, from this here is what we can assess: 1) The damage I took from the enemy. My health dropped to this during our exchange maybe I need to build a bit more Mag-Resist. 2) What they were building. Might need this item later on to counteract theirs. 3) They didn’t see my approach from the bottom river. Assume it’ll be warded next time. Go from different angle. 4) Flash burned. 5 minute cooldown. Try to go again. 5) How my gank just impacted the entire game. I allowed our mid to push and base. However I showed mid and lost enough health to need to base. Top should be fine but the enemy bot may be aggressive considering they know where I am and how low I am. How about Dragon and the other buffs? Will red be in danger of being stolen. Dragon?  6) Reassess strategy. If I come from top next time I will have to save this ability for when they do this. Plan for your next action. 7) Execute and Repeat.   Assessing and Reassessing your actions will overall improve your games. Remember as a jungler you are not here to carry your team. You are here to help when they need it. Junglers are the roaming supports. I am not saying you cannot carry as a jungler but it will never be your primary goal. Your goal is to be more useful than the enemy jungle.
1	Fruitflies, the insect, like a banana because they like fruit.   In most other contexts, the joke is a silly play-on-words that allows the reader to imagine someone throwing bananas until they realize that bananas aren't being thrown, just enjoyed by small, winged insects.   It's a play-on-words in the LoL community because Soraka's auto attack projectile is crescent-shaped and has a yellow tint, leading the players to create the joke that she throws bananas at her enemies for the simple comedic imagery of such, as well as tying her back to her satyr origins (nature spirits, implies that she's got a connection with a dryad [tree spirit] that gives her ammunition to use that won't hurt her foes, but rather will humiliate them, continuing in the pacifistic ideology of the satyr).   More clear? No? Well:
1	A lot of you guys seem to be hating on him for what he's done in the past, the thing is he payed his dues. He was banned, in fact he turned HIMSELF in. The point of being banned is to make "Even" for what you have done. With the "Proof" he has provided he seems to have been banned for no reason or for a reason that doesn't deserve as Perm ban. I get that he has done shit in the past, in fact I used to hate XJ9 (Also, most of the other boosters pissed me off too.) But he's apologized for doing that by turning himself in, took the punishment and moved on. His stream has changed from what I have seen, he seems to be a far less toxic person, isn't that the point of being banned is to make them less toxic. He's not a terrible person and I feel as though this ban was unjust.
1	There are no "unsafe" champions nowadays. Sneaky said on Sunday as long as his flash is up, he really hadnt to worry about getting engaged on, and he played KogMaw, one of the most immobile champions in the game. The combination of summoner spells with the defensive abilities from your team (which there are a lot of in a time where most teams get a Lulu top or a Orianna mid ontop of your support) makes literally no enemy a worthwile target unless there are major positioning errors. You maybe could say they had no hard engage anyways, but it is kind a self fulfilling prophecy: If it is too hard to engage, you wont even pick champions with good engage capabilities.   Seriously what champions nowadays do you pick if you want to teamfight a lot? Maokai and Vi where you fly deep behind enemy defense lines because the adc flashes while you jump to them? Malphite and Hecarim where in the worst case you miss your target because they flashed, leaving you defenseless? Fiddlesticks and Lissandra who rely heavily on flanking enemies (which got harder because of trinkets) and also get poked during sieges? Renekton, Nasus and Shyvana which get ccd and the heavily kited? Every assassin which will not break through the heals and shield? The only teamfight pressure whatsoever nowadays comes from supports with their optional self follow up. Leona ult didnt hit? Just dont go in play safe again? Morgana binding hit a valuable target? Flash+Ult+Blackshield+maybe zhonyas. Nami bubble did hit? Let the tides come!   This was always on the edge of being a problem in LoL, the differences between season 2 and season for though is now you have even more tools to defend with items that can cleanse and supports that are even able to buy these, with enough champions that you always can pick a good poke combo with enough stun pressure so you dont get engaged on regardless of bans, with enough trinkets wards and vision that traps are mostly a thing of the past.   League became too calculative. If you dont make mistakes (which the pros dont do a lot) you wont die. There is no uncearnity, there is no risk taking. In an attempt to be able to counter every aggressions if you play right it happend, you can now counter everything, not by following your own plans, but by stopping the enemy right in their tracks. See become heavy defense based supports become a thing again (like sona, soraka, janna) and you can say goodbye to kills in league of legends.
1	My recommendation: as a first stage play with her, but play for FUN, have a great time together, bond with each other even more than before, gain her trust by making awesome plays together, learn how she plays, is she a risk-taker? what lane does she prefers?. Always focus on having fun and creating a strong bond. Eventually, she'll trust you and will be happy to spend time with you and know that you will understand her. When you reach that spot, tell her to do something else for fun. If she finds you already like someone fun she'll follow you. Don't worry, for now, about school friends, brothers and sisters relationships are more important.
1	I know that people don't get humour if it's done by germans, [but ...](   Also do you really think I'm going to answer seriously to something like this:   >WAIT SO DON'T RUSH NLR ON SONA?   Anyway, back to Mejias:   Mejias is only viable if you literally stomp the lane and killing the enemy doesn't give you any money because the enemy laners are 0/20 or so. This is actually the moment where you should bring your advantage towards the other lanes, with your AD as they hopefully will be suprised by your fed ADC, instead of buying Mejias.   This was mostly a reference to the first support guide I ever read, which was a guide to Soraka with Mejias and Frozen Hearth on Mobafire when I was level 10 or so. He wrote that you should abuse your Ulti to get assists and the Forzen Hearth to be tanky so you don't die. Not sure if guides like this still exist on Mobafire, but at the time I tried it out it surprisingly worked pretty well. I'm pretty sure many people thought so in the beginning.   Also you forget that you as a support are supposed die for the team if needed, which makes the whole "keeping stacks up" even worse. But if we talk about dying. Lux, Janna, Zilean, Blitz and probably Leona have a good chance of keeping up the stacks if they play right, and don't "want to die". But on the later two you don't build Mejias...   You don't need to build Mejias early, only early enough to have it before the teamfights start, because as a support, that's the time where you get lots of assists, if you don't stomp your lane.   Also why would you go Rylai's on any support. Nearly everyone has some kind of slow or other form of cc or does AoE damage or just has no real need for the item. The slows only stack halved. If we are talking about building AP Items, the old DFG was better as it provided CDR which is more useful on Supports as it helps them using their utility more often. The Active wasn't bad as it gave the support some kind of extra dmg and it builded out of Kages, which is a GP5 Money and it's generally cheaper, if you don't have the problem that if will give you a CDR overkill.
1	TF also plays mid whereas Nocturne is typically a jungle who can lane gank like no other jungle can thanks to his ult. It is a gap closer, but the 4s of darkness help, and he has damage on his ult. On top of that, TF's ult can be turned around a lot easier because of misposition, whereas Nocturne's is fail proof as long as you are in range (as far as positioning goes).
0	You cannot translate the chance of susceptibility from an individual to a group.   Sure you can, assuming everyone in the group has the same odds. There's a 99% chance of the first person being protected, then a 0.99^2 (out of 1) chance that the first two in a row are both protected... All the way up to a 0.99^100 (out of 1) chance that all 100 people were successfully made immune from the vaccine. So there is around a 63% chance that (at least) one of those 100 people will be susceptible...
1	I think the most likely explanation is that Yasuo's ult is coded so that it will apply the suspension in air as long as the targets are within the area of effect when Yasuo casts it.   So even if they're later moved outside of the AoE, they remain suspended.   When Gragas ults, his ult  immediately  triggers the displacement necessary to setup Yasuo ult, but takes time to shove them apart.   Yasuo activates his ult immediately after the Gragas ult, at a time when the enemy team counts as airborne, but before they've spread apart.   By the time Yasuo gets to the location, the enemy team has spread apart (in the air).  But because he tagged them all before they spread apart, his ult still affects them.
0	I'll explain how buyback works a bit.   It does suck how low most of the buyback prices are. Believe me, I know. I hated telling customers that I could only give them $10 for their $100 book. But there are reasons for that. Basically, the bookstore will only buy back books that are being used in the following semester. The point of buyback is for the bookstore to get books that they can sell again, it's not out of the kindness of their hearts to give back money to students. So if you have a class like Intro to Calculus that runs every semester, we'll give you half of the new cost of the book (note: that's only the cost of the book. Many of these big classes also come with online codes that the professor requires, and they're one use, we don't buy them back. So our calculus bundle was $200 for a new book + online access, but the online access code by itself cost $80. So we'd give back $60 for the book, because the book itself is worth $120. That's why it doesn't always seem like half). If it's a class that only runs in the fall or in the spring, however, we likely won't buy it back because we can't sell it in the next semester. Sure, it's likely to be used again next spring, but 1) we don't have room to store those unused books for a year and 2) if it turns out that it isn't being used, we just wasted a whole lot of money buying back unusable books.   If the book isn't being used again next semester, it goes for the wholesale price, which is often 10% of the new price (though rarely it can get as high as 25%). These books are generally used by other bookstores in the country, so we ship them off to the wholesale publisher (usually MBS), where they get distributed to other stores. If the book isn't being used by any bookstore at all, it will probably not be worth any money at all. And if a new edition of the book came out, then your old edition will be worth nothing (this really sucks, considering how often publishers love to put out new editions for no reason).   One major problem is that some professors are terrible at getting their book orders in on time. So when buyback comes around, they haven't ordered their books for the next semester and we assume that certain books aren't being used again, so the buyback amount is very low. But then after buyback has died down, the professor tells us that he wants us to use it again, after we've already told dozens of customers that their books weren't worth much.   So I totally agree that it sucks that the prices can be so low, but there are reasons for that and the bookstore can't raise the price without massively losing money.   Also, while it's a good idea to only buy the book when you're sure that you're going to need it, don't wait too long to buy it. We send back our unused books to the publishers about halfway through the semester so we can start making room and setting up for the intersessions and the following semesters. But there are always students who come in during the last few weeks of the semester to buy a book that they suddenly need, only to find out that we had dozens of copies that we just sent back to the publisher. So then we have to reorder copies for each customer that wants them, but many customers get frustrated and go try to find the book elsewhere. It's a shitty situation for everyone. So I would recommend not waiting too long to buy books, even if they're not being used until the end of the semester (this is mostly the case for classes with multiple books, like Theater, English, or Philosophy). Chances are, there are several small, cheapish books for a class that revolves around literary analysis, you're probably going to need to buy every book.   Sorry, I didn't mean to make it that long, but I guess I kind of got into it, haha.
1	I don't see why it is a problem... Adc is one of the only role (if not the only) that can consistently carry a game singlehandedly in all meta. I think the fact that the majority of top challenger are adcs support my point. Also shouldnt compare adc with ap solo lane carries, because ap carries cant consistently output damage like adc do. In my opinion, I like the tanks being strong, but i would like the meta to be more diverse, double tank (top and jungle) is pretty boring.
0	I worked at dennys as teen. Our cooks worked their asses off for minimum wage and none of us ever shared tips with them. Looking back I wish I would have. In comparison I have friends that work at chilis and they have to pay out some tips to hostess, cooks, bussers. Many of them lie so they don't have to pay out as much bc they dont think its fair.  The waiters make server wage but the host/bussers/cooks make the regular minimum wage.
0	I once owed my old university $1,500 and set up a payment plan with them.  They never sent me a bill until I got a notice from the collection agency.  I owed them $2,200 and was pissed because I was making payments to the university.   They found my checks and cashed them then got the bill back from the collection agency.  That $2,200 turned into $2,650 minus the $450 I had paid.   At this point, I was pissed off and demanded my bill be lowered back to the $1,500 mark and they refused.  They told me I could stop making payments on it until it was all sorted out so I did just that.   Not even 2 months later, they sent it back to the collection agency and it was over $3,000 that I owed.  Pissed, I contacted them and the university to see what the hell was going on and they sent it back to the university after they learned they were in error......   This went on until the bill was over $5,000.  I had to contact an attorney and pay them $500 just to get this to stop before it would destroy my credit score.  He sued both the collection agency and the university for something like $150,000.   In the end, they agreed to drop the bill as a settlement and pay the attorney fee's that I hadn't paid.  The entire process was bull shit over almost 16 months.
1	When I watch streamers, I like the following things:   -Tips centered around how you personally get ahead in that lane, such as when you like to push, how you connect your play style to map awareness (for instance different top laners explain different mindsets on aggression in connection to the enemy jungler and pushing.) -music (is nice to listen to, but not too loud that it blocks you out) -commentary (be detailed, and talk a ton.  Don't only give insight into your play and what's around you, but also talk about champions and reasons why different people are doing well (if there's downtime like a farmfest, practically shoutcasting your lane can be nice. -As someone else said, reliable times is amazing helpful. That way I don't tune in and hope to get lucky. -humor, make it funny, addict us to your personality. A lot of streamers are quirky, whereas you seem to be more of the chill type, similar to guardsman bob. Try to combine humor with your demeanor, and make something of a brand for yourself if you can. Unlike the yelling that highlights some streamers (Hotshotgg sometimes, and the rainman, which has been known to be a turnoff sometimes,) find something like Dyrus' monotone/pillow, or oddone's act of blaming champions for mistakes, never actual players--it's something that the viewers look for when they're watching and enjoy.
1	I'd like to try my hand at expanding on what he said a bit more:   His logic is pretty much right; in the sense that you hinder yourself by mindset and such.   It is a bit insulting when you take it in a way that pretty much says that if you've been playing since Season 2 and are still silver, that you are bad. So lets expand that a bit - If you have been playing since Season 2 and are still silver, you haven't put in the amount of effort to understand every little mechanic and decision going into the game, not just the large ones like dragon, towers buffs etc.   This isn't your fault, however, most people don't know where to start. You could play 100 games starting now for the next month and still not improve by much if you don't have the tools and knowledge to know what you should be working on.   Tons of people write comments and responses to others trying to seek advice by simply saying "Focus on last hitting". But you could go so much deeper than that; Pick a role, play the shit out of normals and/or customs and practice getting your CS rates higher without dying or being forced out of lane as much. Take this, and repeat it to other roles. This will overall improve you last hitting by allowing you to practice(while in live games) improving your CS. Just don't forget about that goal.   This is what people need, harder, more detailed answers rather than Focus on last hitting and improve your decision making.
0	I feel you. School was a hard time for me. Always wanting to reward you with god damned stickers. And I kept doing well... I see a kid with a sticker on their face these days and I still have to control a gag reflex. TAKE THAT SHIT OFF!! Adhesives tapes of any kind? Absolutely fine. Plasters (band aids)? Fine. But band aids with pictures on them? I'd honestly rather bleed out. As a 26 year old man and police officer visiting a local school last year, the principal gave me a "principals awards sticker". I'd forgotten those sick fuckers existed and had to brace for impact as he stuck me with it in front of the kids. I finished my visit early so I could peel the thing off, perfectly fold it in half to obstruct the stick then find a safe, lidded, bagged bin (trash can). You don't feel clean afterwards. They're just wrong. Unnatural.
0	My best friend took his life last August and his girlfriends mom posts "I miss you" posts to his wall almost daily (he lived with them). I can understand people being upset at somebody's death, but she still posts to his wall all the time when others are trying to move forward and I know she's doing it for the wrong reasons.   My advice for those who lose a friend would be to stay off social networks where you know mourning posts will be made and instead do something that you used to do with them. I went skateboarding with some friends he and I always skated with and it was relaxing and made things easier.
1	in your original post, without context, it sounds like a tragedy   however, if you told us how many games you have played in total for this season in ranked, it would probably be justified that you're gaining so little LP from wins. there was a point when I was in P1, too, and only gained 1 point for a win. however, my win rate was still around 65-70% or so after tilting from playing badly / 4v5s from the loading screen and falling down back to P3.   on my climb back up from P3 I was gaining 25-30 per win and only losing 12-16. hell, i failed my diamond promo 2x but got back into it almost immediately each time. now, in diamond, I'm still getting 20-28 per win but losing 15-20 per game.   Riot Lyte recently said (about the Tribunal), no system is perfect and there's bound to be a few mistakes here and there, the key is to find an acceptable amount of said mistakes. Their approach to the league system was to make it become skeptical of your abilities if, as you progress, your win rate begins to shift drastically or something like that
0	With no disrespect, PF does not take or want everyone. Their policies are focused on creating an environment without perceived intimidation, going out of their way to capture clients who feel intimidated in other gym atmospheres. PF designed a fitness playground attempting to remove those barriers and discourage the intimidating people from coming. It's only a judgement free zone if you're overweight, physically deconditioned, or only want to lightly use machines and cardio equipment. They do not tolerate ostracizing of those clients.   For as much as Planet Fitness goes out of their way to discourage judgement of one type of client, they have no problem alienating and very audibly ridiculing people outside their target demographic. If you want to do traditional powerlifting or Olympic lifting, they actively create policies against it (they recently made a policy against deadlifting, for example.) Make too much noise while lifting? That "lunk alarm" isn't triggered by a sound breaking a certain decibel, it's manually activated by an employee who determines someone else was too loud. Yes, you were too loud so to point it out, I'm going to be louder and use a flashing light so the whole building knows. Traditional Valsalva maneuver breathing is also against the rules as its too loud and intimidating. Their commercials go further to alienate muscle bound people and portray them as stupid.
1	Kat's passive isn't often about refreshing her ult. She's an AP carry that can act as an executioners in team fights, being able to do her W,E,Q rotation for each person that dies. Her ulti is generally just a starter to get people into execution range. After that, she basically turns into Darius's ult. High damage gap closer refreshing on kills(and assists in Kat's case).   Katarina can execute better than Darius can if played correctly. I believe her damage will typically be higher than darius's ult, especially considering that she doesn't need to build up anything, unlike darius, who has to stack hemorrhage before maximizing his ulti.   The advantage that darius has over katarina is that he's a whole lot tankier and can do things other than a repeated execution. If we want to keep his refreshing ulti mechanic and still feel that he needs to be nerfed(still not sure myself), it may be worth looking at the rest of his kit before hitting his ulti.

"The entire volleyball team, the varsity women's team from the high school was standing in front of us in yoga pants.  The lights from the fireworks was just the right angle and intensity to highlight exactly how nude each of them were under the spandex.  Wives were shuffling their husbands and boys away and making a wall so no one but women saw."
0	Dont they already?   What are semi's blown tires on the sides of the road, or the oil and liquids that leak on to the road from every car? I mean, the whole BS victim mentality here is centered around environmentalism, no? You're in a fucking car...if its not an electric car...the driving and resulting exhaust is worse than the cigarette littering.   That's what I'm saying. This is a petty point centered around environmentalism, but completely devoid of real logic. If the cars and the roads are the actual problem, well that puts the OP in a difficult position...there is no one to villanize as they are also driving a polluting machine, that outweighs the effect of a butt on the ground.   And please don't take my vernacular for aggression or defensiveness. I really do invite a calm discourse on this.  So I mean the general response or
0	It doesn't say to assume they're all idiots; just that you shouldn't trust other drivers. You can communicate and look for their signals, just as you were taught. However, there are too many accidents because people trust other drivers to be 100% consistent with what they're doing. Back off a bit from the car ahead of you, make sure you know for sure that the car next to you is out of the way, don't wait until the last second to start slowing down, etc, etc, etc. We're all human, and even though we're able to communicate while driving, there are many who don't. At the same time, we're plenty prone to making mistakes while behind the wheel, and having distractions like passengers, things on the road, advertisements, other cars (sometimes), the radio, and even a phone can only make the chances of messing up that much worse. Plus, I've never seen anybody drive perfectly. Every time I ride with friends, the driver always has their little quirks behind the wheel, and I tend to have a few of my own. It's all on who has control of the car, and you can never tell who does what. It's fine to communicate and assume that the drivers know what they're doing, but it's just a matter of being aware that a single, little mistake can lead to something much worse. You never know, that shiny new truck in front of you might have somebody texting behind the wheel. If you're trusting that person to drive right, then you'll only end up caught up in that wreck.   Yeah, it's a lot of "if" stuff here, but when it comes to driving, I think that better safe than sorry is a  nice way of looking at it. Driving isn't a perilous experience, full of flaming engines and flying car parts, but that  one time  that something goes wrong, the drivers are always left with that sense of, "if only I'd done X differently."
0	We talked about it, even picked out rings together and I asked her dad's permission - all before proposing.  My wife's got her own mind and I knew she should have a say in her ring, etc.   The proposal was still a shock though, I kept pretending I was busy and we kept talking about maybe going to Scotland or somewhere cheap.  A few days before I proposed she was on the phone to her mum complaining about how disorganised I was.  She was at the airport, with packed bags and a passport before she clocked anything, and only then did she realise I had organised to take her to Rome (even got her time off work).  A few hours later we were engaged.  She still had the huge surprise that every girl deserves, but it was the nice kind of surprise - she also had her Dad's blessing, and the exact ring she wanted.
1	Basically i know exactly what you mean, ive been playing lol for 2 years and have hit a wall 3 times (currently on my 3rd at 1250) when i satrted i was stuck at 800 elo no matter what happened i thought i either get trolls leavers ect, then again at 1100, and now as ive said 1250 but then i realised is it was my play as you have, i jus persevered, kept playing and watched streams, LOL replay is a really good way of improving s you can watch your self and other lanes, learn to help your team in there lanes, as well as your own, 1 wave is nothing in comparison to a kill in mid. i belive i can improve, but i have no time for lol atm, so waiting untill season 3 to start my climb
1	The damage control is insane. The best thing you guys, as representatives for the F5 management and team, can do right now is to realize that the battle is lost, that people don't believe that you're sincere, and that you have both, as well as the F5 management, handled this situation horribly. First the justification thread for prototype started by mizzpeach and then this blunt article trying to justify mizzpeach.
0	Multiple highways merging and splitting combined with an over abundance of vehicles along with a common travel time. For example, rush hour or lunchtime. The vehicles, which fit fine in the 7 lanes, are suddenly forced to compress down to 2 lanes to merge onto another highway. Granted, depending on the specific connection, only maybe 60% of the traffic is going that way so we will say 3.5 lanes of traffic are compressing down to 2. Now these 2 lanes are compressing down to 1 lane which is then merging into the other highway and the whole time traffic is building up behind this event because most drivers aren't going to be able to do this at the 65 mph speed limit and most of the ones who do probably shouldn't. Also, don't forget that people are human so you have things like people in the right lane not wanting to merge trying to get over to the left and then you have the drivers in the left lanes who didn't see their exit coming up trying to get over to the right. Both these groups are going slightly slower to try to get over. This keeps happening because cars keep pouring onto the highway so the backup starts farther and farther back and everyone wants to get there sooner than everyone else so you have the group of people who pass the patiently waiting line of cars and then slow down with their signal on waiting for someone to let them in. What's that? No one did and they are at their exit? That's ok because they'll just stop in the 3rd lane and wait for someone to let them in. It's not just one though. It's a bunch of them. Suddenly it's not just 2 lanes blocked it's 3. Humans are human though so the next impatient group is going to block the 4th lane a little farther back. But wait! There's more! Everything this highway is dealing with? The one everyone is trying to merge with is dealing with it too! So even the cars in that single lane that used to be 2 lanes that used to be 3.5 lanes is now merging at a staggering 5 mph while the cars that aren't currently waiting to merge build up at 60 mph.
0	This reminds me of a pretty funny story. My grandma has been a hairdresser for over 40 years and owns a hair salon. She normally does all of my haircuts for me, or has someone who works at her salon do them. I was spending some time with her one day and for whatever reason (i forget) she wanted me to get a haircut. The salon she owns was being remodeled so she took me to an Aveda hair salon.   While having my hair cut my grandma made a simple polite comment about something she wanted done with my hair. (something along the lines of "could you shorten 'this' up a little bit) This immediately set the hair stylist off into bitch mode. The stylist said it would look horrible if she did what my grandma had said. The stylist went on an arrogant tangent about how she was the "trained professional" and that my grandma should trust her "better judgement".   That was the first time I had ever heard my sweet old grandma swear. She called the stylist a bitch, very loudly in front of about 20 people in the Salon. My grandma then proceeded to let the stylist know about every mistake she made and that my grandma was a hairdresser for 40 years and owned a salon for 30+ years.   We ended up walking out without paying as a manager apologized about the stylist's behavior.
1	Well it would scare away some people which for you might be good, but from a company perspective less players=less moniz.   I'm not saying Riot is a money whore company, but they are super behind companies like Valve who is in my opinion at the top of updating, fixing, and overall giving players the best value for their buck. Valve probably makes more money than Riot, but that dosen't mean they need 5+ years to make a freaking recorder for the game. I mean Call of Duty has that and those are released every year. Then again they are working with a "old engine" well what the hell are you waiting for? Go get a new one, we will adapt like the PC masterrace we are..
1	Good list man.  I upvoted, but I'm not sure I agree with your strategy.  I've always found that the best way to learn top lane is to learn a few different characters and spam them all the time.  Once you have them mastered, then maybe go on to more, but it seems most pros have adopted the strategy that you should spam one or two characters as much as possible, and I tend to agree.   Also, here is perhaps a complete list of what I'd consider "common" top lane matchups.  Note it doesn't include AD carries top, which are also a possibility.  Nyjacky has played Trist top.  Dyrus/TRM play Corki top.  Westrice plays Vayne top.  Lots of carries not named Ashe can go top basically :P.  I didn't see them as common though, so I excluded them.     Akali     Cho'gath     Fiora     Fizz (not so much any more, but when I wrote this people played him more top instead of mid).     Galio (see my note on Fizz).     Gangplank     Garen     Irelia     Jarvan     Jax (Though now you mostly see him in the jungle, but he does counterpick some like Fiora).     Kennen     Lee Sin     Malphite     Maokai (usually in the jungle, but it is viable I tell you!)     Mordekaiser (believe he is better mid, but some people run him top).     Morgana     Mundo     Nasus     Nidalee     Olaf     Pantheon     Renekton     Rumble     Shen     Shyvanna     Singed     Sion (mostly goes mid, but can be played top easily  see TRM )     Skarner (mostly goes jungle, but was played top occassionally when this guide was written)     Swain     Talon (again, went top more when this was written.  Now usually used to counterpick mid.)     Teemo     Trundle     Tryndamere     Udyr     Vladamir     Volibear     Warwick     Wukong     Yorick     Riven (Missed her somehow)       As you can see, this yields 720 or so "common" top lane matchups that are possible.  This doesn't even include variables that would affect the matchups like starting items, runes and masteries, jungle pressure, and whether you're on blue or purple side.  Needless to say, learning all of the different matchups would take a while.  It is probably more time-efficient to master one champion (39-40 matchups depending if you count mirror matches) or so.  You'll learn about other champions through you spamming.  Also, finding those rare guides that give you insights into the specific matchups against many characters can help a lot.
0	Please explain your reasoning on why you wouldn't want to have sex with your attractive friend?  The key word is attractive.  Of course I have women who are friends that aren't super attractive.  I don't base friendships on looks, but if I did have an attractive female, who already is super cool due to her being your friend in the first place, how can you not want to sleep with them?  You're connecting on both a mental and physical level which is ideal for mating.   I can only think of one reason why you wouldn't want to sleep with your hot friend and that reason is you don't know if they will talk about you after the sexing.  Its very hard I feel to have sex with a friend and make it stay only friends with benefits.   From my experience it will turn into something more which you may or may not want to happen.  To have sex with your friends doesn't mean you want to have a relationship with them.  In your brain all you're thinking is I would totally have guilt free, hot sex, with my hot friend who isn't going to tell anyone, and she will let you also sleep with other women.  See its a complicated situation that will happen this way usually never. So usually you don't sleep with your hot friend.  But I'm pretty sure a lot of males with any type of imagination...or better yet sex drive have already pictured having sex with their hot hot friends or at least had one sexual thought about their female hottie tot friends.  But to say a male doesn't want to sleep with an attractive female friend if offered sounds insane to me.  But then again I am a very imaginative, horny male, with a mix of attractive and "wouldn't have sex" but their personality is awesome friends so this response could be bais.   I'd imagine if you had a very low sex drive then I could also see you not wanting to sleep with your friends or any person for that matter.  I think its more of the ramifications of having sex with your friend that is keeping more males from doing it because you know it could either end the friendship or make it weird.  But if neither of those would happen then yes all males with a high sex drive would be sexing all their female friends if they let them.
1	Morello's response for those at work / unable to check / lazy:   To clarify this, let me dev diary Pulsefire Ezreal for you guys;   At the start, it was determined Ezreal needs not only a new skin, but something that'd be worth the wait since the last one. What we started with was a pretty clean and simple cyborg-inspired Ezreal skin that had a little clean-up to do. We could ship it out, but we wanted to make it better quality.   After improving it, our zealous (in a good way!) particle artist Adam started adding sweet little touches to it, and we just kept seeing more and more potential. Now, after the particle effects were ramped up, the animations needed to match....it kept getting better and better, but as we upped each new element, the art guys kept getting excited on what was coming together and kept pushing it further with new stuff.   Basically, we want to do something really special with Pulsefire Ezreal, but the reality of that is it takes a lot longer. This kind of thing (development time vs scope) happens all the time, but a lot of the reason we don't reveal the information early is because the expectation of it coming out really soon after people find out occurs.   So, no new info other than "soon(tm)", but I at least wanted to give you some insight as to why we're not releasing it yet. And I think it's the right decision - it's totally worth it.     The question he was answering:   Just been checking out videos people have made for the skin and the top comment on one of the videos was this. "This skin was removed because riot felt it didn't fit in quite well. So don't hope for it. It use to show under his skins not anymore. I wanted this skin so﻿ bad."   I've also heared other stuff like it was held back for some touching up before it'll be released. I really hope we will get it because it's very Unique and as a kind of skin collector I can't pass this one up.
1	Farming is rarely a problem in low MMR. That's just what people assume, because they can't see that what's really holding them back is very poor decision making and understanding of the game; nobody really wants to think they consistently make  terrible  decisions and read situations totally wrong, take the wrong action, go to the wrong spot, etc. You need almost nothing in the way of mechanics to get out of that range IMO, just to actually think about what's going on all throughout the map and play according to that, as opposed to tunneling on - well, anything.
0	Well, there's a cut-off point.   On the one hand, just meeting a girl in the club and dancing with her doesn't really mean you gotta know if she was always a girl. You don't ask random club-goers what STD's they have, or how many sexual partners, or even if they have some family history of diseases or are of a certain ethnic descent. If you're shallow enough that you have to know what was 'twixt their legs at birth before you'll even dance with them, I see that as your problem.   If you've gotten to the bedroom and THEN you find out, though... well, I consider it important enough to share something like that with a partner  BEFORE  you start any serious hanky-panky. It's kind-of slutty to hook up with someone without getting to know them, or letting them get to know you.   Of course, in the future, all things optimal, nobody'd ever know the difference. Ideal treatment for transgender is complete and total surgical and therapeutic alteration to match the 'preferred' gender. Obviously, such treatment isn't currently feasible, but that's not to say it never will be. At that point, if you're still going on about the differences, I'd say you have a mental issue of your own.
0	Everyone in this thread that is ignorantly talking about signal timing should at least read the [wikipedia page]( Im a Civil Engineering student and I can tell you from my brief introduction to signal timing so far it is the cheapest and most effective way to manage intersections throughout the day.  Most signal cycles are 2 min or less so if you get fed up at a light listen to a song on the radio. Chances are you probably will get through the light in under one song.  Maybe two if you get caught up in a queue.  Sure it is easy to say "throw super expensive sensor systems on every light" but that is an ignorant statement.  The amount of monitoring technology needed to do this would be absurd.  The computer would need to know how many cars were in each lane in each direction of traffic currently stopped at the light and heading towards it.

0	I dunno, man. I've been here for over 3 years now, and right after I joined I remember there being an insane string of bullshit, "I rescued this kitty from a dumpster behind a satanic church" type posts.   It was followed by a hilarious string of spoof posts with people claiming to have done things like traveling halfway around the world with Bill Gates on a clandestine mission to kill dozens of terrorists, and just happened to rescue a puppy that got caught in the crossfire in a burning orphanage.
1	Restrict your champions to like 2 or 3 per role. Get good at like 4 roles, you're not always gonna get what you want so be competent in almost all if not all.   Ideally pick "OP" solo queuers if you own them or like playing them. I personally think its more important to like the way the kit works as I feel it makes me play better but not everybody will share this trait.   Don't rage at your teammates. Rage IRL if you need but don't talk shit to your teammates. Yelling at them will not make them play better, they might even play worse. Plus when people are typing instead of playing doesn't help. So just praise play or don't say shit.   Farm like a madman and try to dominate your lane. Pay attention to your lane and try to get any and all objectives. Objectives are better than kills, and farm is uber important. 20 cs is I think similar to a kill in gold so if you're missing cs to harass but not even getting kills.. You're getting boned. Objectives also help any losing lanes on your team.   Oh and learn not to throw as bad, everybody does. Being 5-0 doesn't mean shit if you make a bad decision and die.
1	The whole rework has been an ongoing exercise in "we have no idea what we're doing anymore." I mean... remember when his axe would stick in walls by default? Because apparently throwing through walls was killing Olaf player's fun?   It's like they've ignored all the other changes they've implemented in the game. Olaf was a force in S2 because stacking health was easy, cheap, and didn't have a lot of counters. Now, though, BoRK is all but standard on anyone who autoattacks and percent health spells are all over the place - there's plenty of room for counterplay and counterbuilding to deal with Olaf now. He was strong because he got a lot of free stats and could afford to just stack cheap health with utility attached. That's just not true anymore. Old Olaf might have needed  buffs  in the current state of things.   But instead of just letting the game and the players figure out how to handle it, they Eve'd him, and decided "hey, remakes are a thing we're doing why not Olaf" and they've bungled basically everything that made him unique and fun (no more zero range axe throws guys! that certainly didn't bring a lot of strategy and skill to his playstyle at all!) in favor of homogenizing him with the other bruisers and now... maybe the melee AD carries instead. (He actively gets EASIER to kill when he ults? Are we being serious here?) Even sadder, his remake and Skarner's are starting to look very much the same. A line skillshot slow? An AS steroid with survivability? A melee range damage skill?
1	Oh yes, you are right:) Gonna take ur
1	I stopped reading right here, because you're just absolutely wrong.   You should have kept going... i addressed some of the thing like manascrew + other later in my post.   There is consistency to be found in magic randomness, if you build your deck well enough you will have a high chance of having the card you want at the moment you want. Sure sometime you get screwed but if you actually took the time to balance the curve and got a good split of land, creatures and spell you will  most of he time  get what you want out of the deck. Thats the art of deck building in a nutshell, increasing your chance of consistency is the goal of any good builder. You need to make your 'worst case draw' stil somewhat winnable and you need to reduce your chance of getting that draw.   My point is that while magic is a random based game there is consistency behind it all.   Its a 1v1 with no outside factor,(tournament format)  you can get screwed from time to time but you average game goes without a problem,  The matchup are consistent,  The meta is somewhat consistent,  The card pool is quite consistent, a change every few month at the most.   > player like me wouldn't stand a chance in lane vs someone much more skilled like Scarra... yet LSV can lose to complete noobs playing magic, all it takes is a manascrew.   In lol a single crit can win you the lane, Critplank was dominating toplane with a 4% crit chance and he is the best example of that. It was removed but think about it, there are other 'screws' that can happen in lol to. If you played critplank vs scarra and got 1-2 crit in the first second of laning you just won most of your lanning phase. All you need is a few ganks from the jungler(or him camping for you) and youve just beaten a pro player at laning. A good phage proc when your jungle ganks can also turn it arround and allow you to win the lane.   For all that we know luck might give Scarra 900 elo teamates and you might get 2000+ elo on your side and they can carry you.   You say that luck has a very small part of lol but unless you are playing with the same team over and over again luck is what creates your games. Luck distributes the braindead teamates the same way it distributes the good ones. You are at the mercy of the matchmaking system   Consider getting bad teamate the same as getting manascrewed... You lack the ressources to win the game, Its praticaly the same.   >skill is the only determining factor to who wins or loses in a game of LOL   This is where you lose all credibility... just like in magic, skill does play a major factor in the game but its not everything. If you say that skill is the only fator then you clearly have no idea what you are talking about. Unless you are from a pro team or only play ranked 5v5 then luck is probbaly more of a factor then skill when faced with opponent of similar skill level.   >Phage procs, Yi's Q, Crit chances don't decide the outcome of a game   They can actually. A phage proc leading into a kill can snowball a lane for which will then carry. A few good bounce on Brand ult can turn a teamfight arround. A darkwind from fiddle who bounces between th ap carry and  * can silence him until he dies preventing him from doing anything in a teamfight and then winning because of it.
1	You're wrong. Very. A better analogy would be a straight A student getting a C for an 85% exam because the teacher expects better of them. Certain complaints, especially from the Diamond players in the aftermath of the new Masters tier, are because the LP change is fairly arbitrary and not in fact based on elo like you purport it to be. Riot said that in due time the MMR of diamond divisions would even out after "the best" entered Masters over time. It's been a long time since and the imbalance is still evident.
0	Alright, you will enjoy this story of my lazy smoking roommate.   After everyone in the house complained of his smoking, he never stopped.  We used every means available to communicate our displeasure.  Nothing.  That guy never changed.   So one day, I remember that smokers lose their sense of taste.  So since he was so trustworthy to place his toothbrush right beside the communal wash basin in the washroom.  I decided to clean the brown/yellowish piss stained toilet (he's never cleaned it in his 3 month stay here) with his toothbrush.  I cleaned it for about a week. No reaction.  He never complained and he kept his toothbrush out there in the open.   So I decided one day, that... fuck it... I'm gonna REALLY clean the toilet, and I removed all the dark stains of the inside of the toilet bowl with his toothbrush.  The next morning, I woke up because he was brushing his teeth so hard.  My room is adjacent to the washroom. Think about this, normally I sleep through the noise, but today he brushed so hard he fucking woke me up.  Can you imagine?   The more he brushed, the harder he was polishing his pearly whites with brown turds.   After a long time, he stopped.  Took a shower and left.  I thought to myself, the gig must be up.  I'm gonna be in trouble now.   So I go in the washroom, and sure enough, his toothbrush is gone.  So he must had enough sense to hide his toothbrush now.  Then I noticed the toothpaste in the floor, from the basin trailing all the way to the showers.  Inside the showers was his toothbrush.  The Sherlock in me, extrapolates that the more he brushed the shittier his mouth tasted, so he kept brushing even in the showers.   The next day, he moved his toothbrush to the normal spot where it always was.  And was brushing VERY lightly.  I can only assume that he thought that his smoking caused his gums to smell like shit when he brushed.   If you're wondering... why didn't rrodvictim01 fear for retaliation?  The reason is simple.  In order to continue my ruse, I kept my own toothbrush out in the open.  I mean.. if I suddenly withdrew my toothbrush from the communal areas, would that not arouse suspicion? So... I left my old toothbrush out there as a decoy, then kept a new and pristine toothbrush in my room.  Ditto for all my other toiletries... they all had a decoy.  Every item in the communal area was a decoy, I had a duplicate in my room since day one of my scheme.   He was gone in 2 weeks.  I dunno if he suspected me.  My new roommate does not reddit.
0	Yeah, OSX is a solid OS, but no reason to be ridin dick about it.   Also I'm a little suspicious that someone who has worked as a developer for MS and Google doesn't know how to make lists in markdown.
1	It's not clogging up anything! It's the stupid memes and other BS that was clogging up this subreddit. Your discussions are something I look forward to each day now to read about how different people play champs.   Don't listen to the pissers and whiners and let the downvotes speak for themselves.
1	the meta can never be balanced as something will always be stronger than another like cinderhulk junglers being "more powerful" than say assassin junglers. Do you or people even realize how diverse and unique this meta is? A few months ago it was only vi j4 and reksai. Now we see everything from gnar jungle to vi to sejuani to gragas. Urgot is a viable pick. Nautlius and kennen support are a thing. it isnt the same 3 champs in a role like it was a few months ago. Yet ppl think that because they dont know how to play against sej jg, urgot mid, naut support, and all these new things, that the game is "unbalanced". Reason shit like this has high win rates is because theyre new and ppl havent adjusted, but instead of playing against these things or as them to understand how it works, they wine on reddit that x champ is to strong or that an item is too good and needs to be nerfed.   Edit:
1	my plan is to eventually start playing PVP, but I wanna get to know the ins and outs of the whole dance before I play against an opponent that doesn't let me make a mistake.   Bot matches are great for your first few games, they help you get use to how do the most basic things in the game (like move around, buy items etc.). However if you plan on playing pvp, don't use bots to "Learn how to play first", or to "work on your mistakes", due to the nature of the game, bots are really ineffective at this.   Firstly the only thing a bot will teach you to do, is defeat the bot. Most of the time, you defeat the bot by exploiting it in some way, this can be anything from constant ganking on one weak bot, or just ignoring the bot and last hitting so you have tons of farm, or other possible ways. But at the end of the day, most of what you've learned is just exploiting a program that isn't every capable of adapting, unlike human players.   Second, Bot are awful at showing where you need to improve, because often bots are a very bad at something (like last hitting), godly at other things (like reflexive actions), or don't actively part take in a major part of the game (like jungling, warding, and counter warding), causing you to have an extremely warped understanding of the game. Hell some item builds for a character might work well in a bot game, but is awful against real players.   ok, I've gotten board of writing this, and can't really remember where I was going with this, but what I wanted to say was... Start playing PvP, cause you don't know shit till you've gotten your feet good and wet. And don't let rage deter you, as everyone gets raged at, at some point. Some might be justified, some might be unjustified but it's going to happen better to learn how to deal with it now.
0	When someone brings their race into an argument it is referred to as "playing the Race Card." This phrase is used much more often in cases when referring to an argument in which race has little to nothing to do with the argument. The person who "plays" the card is banking on the opponent to back out out of fear of being seen as racist. Saying something along the lines of "Put it back in the deck" implies you know exactly what they are doing, so that shitty wildcard won't work here.
0	Nothing that you've learned has been in vain. Make a practical use of your knowledge to take your education to the next level. I love coding so naturally engineering made sense, but I also enjoy history, philosophy, and psychology. Some people's passion lives in these realms and my girlfriend is a prime example. She studied psychology and can blow me out of the water with her knowledge (the DSM is a fascinating book). She just completed her masters and is in the market for a good job. She might have more debt than some, but she isn't working outside of her field and can put her degree to practice. If going back to school means having more debt to follow your dream than take it on. At the very least most states have teaching certificates do you can spark the next generation and discuss your passion everyday. I know Reddit loves to dismiss the arts, but they shape the world. Not everyone has the creativity for the arts and not everyone has the intellect for a STEM field. To be truthful you need to find what excites you and follow it. Just don't confine yourself to something you hate or you'll regret it later in life when you become pigeonholed in a field.
1	They should make it so the league points in Diamond 1 and Challenger are the samr thing. So you won't just stop getting league points in D1. Let's say summoner number 50 in Challenger has 166 lp. This means that for anyplayer in D1 wanting to get above him, that person needs atleast 167 lp. Which will then demote the guy with lover lp and promote the D1 player. This way you will be able to see your progress towards Challenger and still feel like you are actually getting something.
0	I can understand a bit of your pain. However, it might be to your benefit to see her before she goes.   My mother's step-dad died of cancer a few years ago. Growing up I found out that he molested my mom and I hated him for it. My mom left at 18 and as a consequence I never met him (until I heard he was dying). I hated a man I never met for the pain he caused my family. When my mom asked if I would go to see him with her I felt that I could not refuse.   We drove out to see him when things went bad and I thought about the terrible things he did to her and the things I should say to him. I wanted to express how his actions scarred my mom and how her relationships to men were always full of mistrust due to him. That all changed when I saw him. We got to his house and seeing him hooked up to oxygen and in a wheelchair changed something in me. He was so sad and pathetic looking that I found myself unable to hate him. My hate turned to pity and then that pity turned into acceptance. A huge weight felt like it was gone. I don't think I forgave him, but I released my bad feelings and stopped thinking about him. I closed that part of my life with no regrets.   He died a year later. I didn't go to the funeral but was able to see him pass without much emotion. I have not really thought about him until I saw your post. I hope this helps, I know I don't know your whole story and everyone is different. But I think my hatred was poisoning me and I didn't realize it.
1	very mixed feelings about this. i think they should go for mid game/late game to decide the outcome. because it really isnt fair for the entire game to be decided by the first 2 minutes. im not sure this example is going to get fixed, but i was playing jax vs khazix top yesterday. i havent played against kha in a long time, i was worried that he would have his jungler gank for him to snowball him so i went to trinket halfway through the wave and missed 1 minion. i get back to lane and he hits 2 and rushes me. as a level 1 jax i literally couldnt do anything, i didnt want him to get an isolation q on me for harass so i stayed inside my minion wave but i realized he was going for the kill, he q'd me in the minion wave, and i just had to run. he leaped at me and got an isolation q and ignite for level 2 fb. just a small mistake. i didnt burn flash for it because i accepted my fate.   i get back to lane and dont actually miss any cs, but his jungler comes this time and now i lose 2 waves. game goes to level 5 and he freezes the wave at his tower while he turns 6 and im 5. now i cant even get remotely close because he just spiked in power and i cant even put up a fight withut my ult. he turns level EIGHT and im 5 and i finally see if i can just get SOME experience and he kills me obviously. i get back to lane and hes 3/0 level 10 and im level 5. my jungler didnt even come because he thought it was useless   funny we ended up winning because i was in my plat 3 promos and my team was amazing and really positive. but
1	Curse has always had a weak bot lane since forever ago. They always knew their bot lane was weak, but they've tried to cover their weak spot by focusing harder on the solo laners. It's never been a secret that if you want to win a game, you just trash their bottom lane because to be quite honest, pretty much any bottom lane can beat them.   I like Elementz I really do, but I know and he knows that he's lesser support than most of the other supports in LCS (at least mechanically). He redeems himself with his morale and encouragement to his team.  I honestly don't think he or Cop can should be replaced because they fit the role of the team perfectly which is to get by. They're not meant to carry or do anything special. The way Curse got around this was by never letting their bot lane fight a straight 2v2. Saint would give Jacky or Voy the torch to carry on, and Elementz and Cop would be there to help out.   I think the way this was handled was quite bad though. Saint/Elementz should not be letting this leak to the public. It's very bad for Curse and there's no reason to bash others like this. They need to take care of their problems, and Liquid needs to step the fuck up instead of playing buddy buddy with Saint.   Anyways it's 3 AM and I can't think properly so yeah. I feel like this was a rambled thought, so now it probably sounds really shitty. Also when he talked about nobody voting for Elementz, no pro player picked Jacky either except for Jacky himself.
0	There is a reasonable assumption that in order for you to be suitable for that specific role, then you will be required to have relevant knowledge pertaining to it.
0	I work for a different cable company (Large, but not Comcast or Time Warner) as a Broadband Technician. There are hundreds of ways internet service can go out. Most times it happens when a cable somewhere is cut. Either from the street to your house if just your house is out, or a fiber line to your node in the case of a whole area outage. About 90% of my trouble calls for internet issues are fixed inside the customer's home. Cheap cable/connectors/splitters can wreak havoc on a stable internet connection as they usually are not properly shielded from noise and interference. Sometimes there are simply too many splitters or we're trying to use old RG 59 lines for internet. Also, in aerial areas, squirrels are little bastards and will chew on cables for like, no reason.   I'm not as familiar with area outages as I am not a system tech. The issues Ive seen are usually a problem with a node or a power supply.   Other times power supplying an amplifier can go out, in which case we have to get the power company to get the power there back on. Our system techs are on call in case of area outages, the can usually fix minor outages in under an hour, major outages can take longer.
1	Fucked up on the number of champs Riot releases every week on rotation. Edited the post to remove those references.  ^^^^sorta   To add on to this,  I think 10 is a good number for champ rotation  here's what I think is a good breakdown:     50% low skill floor champs (for beginners to have variety and be able to learn multiple roles)     30% intermediate skill floor champs     10% high skill floor champs (for the veterans)     10% "flex" champs - possibly to counter "unfun" champs to play against, such as using Soraka to counter Karthus (though I would prefer that this slot be used for high skill floor champs as a vet)     Why 10? The next logical step up from 8 would have been 12, but that amounts to a 50% increase and League only has 117 champions (as of now). With 12 per week, assuming no repeats, the entire list of champs could be rotated through in 10 weeks, whereas a 10 champ rotation would take 12 weeks to get through.   I don't have the exact numbers on the frequency of repeat selections, but since the lower skill cap/skill floor champs get rotated in quite often, it should take about anywhere from 4-6 months on a 10 champ rotation before all the champs have been rotated through, which should give new players  plenty  of time to figure out their playstyle and the meta.   Edit: Just double checked the LoL site for the current champ rotation, aaaaand I'm an idiot. They've been doing this for months now. Please disregard.
1	I'm a mod on the solomid forums, and I was working on filtering questions on the oddone AMA thread, not the TSM Q&A. However, you have no idea how many times questions were asked/repeated.   The thread to public members looks to be 22 pages (220 posts, many with mutliple questions) but when you factor in the hidden ones it is 37 pages long. That's 150 posts of repeated questions/spam.
0	Here's what OP is saying from the point of view of the guy:   You start hooking up with some chick, and then one night you end up having sex.  As a guy you're like 'Nice!', but then you realize that you want to go again.  So you call her and boom shes staying over again.  Now you go out with her to a bar once or twice because its a fun thing to do before a night of fornication.  She happens to meet a friend and/or co-worker once in a while just in passing or on accident, but who cares? No big deal. This goes one for at least a month, maybe two or six. Then one day it happens; someones girlfriend, or some coworker is like "hey you should bring your girlfriend to our barbecue, she can be your beer pong partner".  That's where things start to go south.  You start to tell him/her that your just fuck buddies but then realize what your saying and manage an "Ok sounds great, I love beer pong." All the sudden your starring at a text that you're about to send the girl literally in your phone as 'F-Buddy' that's inviting her to a barbecue.  You hit send and theres no reply.  Days, weeks pass nothing.  That is the life cycle of the fuck buddy.
0	How are tablets "always so awkward and uncomfortable to hold at an angle where you can read or interact with"? For reading or digesting media that doesn't require interaction, you just hold it like you would a book or plant each hand either side. For interacting with it, you either have your hands either side and use your thumbs or hold it with one hand and do shit with another. My Nexus 7 weighs nothing, fits my palm perfectly and has a keyboard that makes it really easy to use with just one finger.   I'd never use my tablet as my catch-all main device but it's perfect for any kind of media consumption or shitty games, especially when my tablet has a higher resolution than my computer monitor.
0	Got pulled over as a teenage coming home from work late at night. Asshole cop pulled me over for no other reason than not using my turn signal when I was the only car on the road. I got away with a 'warning' but I've used my signals ever since...fuck I let the cop win.
1	i have about 150 bot games too. Thats not because i like them rly hard but my GF thinks its kinda annoying to have such an amount of flames and ragekids in this game so everytime we play together we play against bots. And i have to say it rly helped me out with champs like draven to get his Q under control. But at least Fooling around is bad but if you try your best i cant judge you.   Blindpicks IMO are for learning champs. Draft Pick is for guys like me who dont rly like the pressure of a ranked match. I mean its rly exhausting for me to play more than 2 or 3 ranked games because there is so much flame and i want to win too because of the League points. In draft i just can play and if we loose a game we can just surrender without loosing anything. What i want to tell is
1	I'm hovering around Gold 1 and I main top. I've tried everything I can think of in an attempt to find a top laner that doesn't either lose lane horribly to Ryze, or doesn't get drastically outscaled by Ryze.   Any melee-range laner is pretty much out of the question, but I've tried Jayce and staying back and poking, but if I miss an accelerated blast, he just runs at me while it's on cooldown and way outdamages me. Then, if I try to knock him back with hammer-form, I just get rooted in place and take an extra Q. Besides all of this, his ranged form isn't actually that long of a range if you can't EQ.   I've tried Vlad and just letting him shove to turret and try to stay out of his range. I lose a lot of CS to the turret and being zoned, though, so he usually outscales me pretty hard.   Someone like Kennen I thought might be good but I haven't had success with it.   Mundo gets punished very hard before he gets any MR, and even after that you still get outscaled overall (Ryze will do more damage, as well as being very tanky)   The only thing I've found that can beat Ryze is heavy jungle pressure and camping, which isn't always a possibility, and if my jungler  can't  come top frequently to help, the lane just goes completely awry most of the time. I've just been asking the team first pick to ban him, and if he isn't banned, then to just hope they don't pick it.
1	Wukong is the best champion in the game. Lemme sum it up for you alright?   There wuz this bad ass jungle right? RIGHT?! Then all of a sudden a big ass rock falls into it. BAM (ROCK SOUND EFFECTS)! Then mofo wukong pops out of the rock (rock monkeys rule!). This guy was all like challenging the big bad enemy's in the jungle but then he was all like "yo these shits are too eZ too beat" so he travelled around and beat the shit out of things. Then he met master yi and he taught him wuju style because wukong is a cool as fuck talking monkey. Who wouldn't teach him? Now he kicks ass in the League Of Legends.
1	Lux.   You have to play her smart against certain multi gap-closing champs (Kassadin, Ahri, Leblanc) and manage her mana as her mp5 is really bad. She's not too easily zoned without having to take damage and she's extremely difficult to gank if they time a slow snare chain.   Once mid game hits and you are good with skill shots she becomes a real terror. Your Q-E-R combo will 70-0 a carry and if you have good farm and some items you can 100-0 someone. Basically if they get snared, they die. Your range allows you to build direct AP forgoing some of the survival ap items (RoA / Rylais) and sometimes even Mejais as viable.   The true strength in Lux that makes her broken though is her sheer utility and damage combination for her team. Her shield for both fights and baron is OP. She can double snare and chain with a slow allowing kiting/poking all day long. Finally, her ulti. Oh man, that is just cream on top. A 24 second ultimate with 3000 range that deals 500 (+.75 AP ; also procs passive for more) damage. A good Lux burns that ulti as a team fight starts and watch the enemy melt. Not to mention in her combo she can one shot an enemy carry end game at a 1000 range unless they have an MR item along with Aegis/Soraka aura on their team, even then taking them down to barely any hp. Don't get caught.   Running Flash Teleport (if you are in range of ignite chances are you are already dead mid-late to late unless using a lich bane finish) on her makes it absolutely broken for bot lane ganks early game too. Landing a double root and putting down the slow is almost a double kill everytime.
1	I'm stuck in bronze 5 and recently my MMR has dropped so low that it is impossible to get out (I'm getting clamped pretty hard). I know my roles up to at least a Silver V level but I'v been on a massive losing streak because of school and what not. I don't know what to do anymore since I used to get 20-30 points for a win but now I only get 5, yet I lose 15
1	Ended up in a 5v5 normal draft game vs him/his team Thursday night with my team of: Gold 5, Silver 4, Silver 5, Bronze/Unranked, low Bronze/Unranked. His team was plat, plat, he was on his gold5 smurf, then Silver 1 and I think an unranked.   I wish I understood how our team gets matched up against people like that. I appreciate playing vs people better than me for the opportunities to lane against, but my Silver 5 friend being in lane vs someone that much better than him is almost an auto loss, even ignoring the double plat bot lane vs our two bronze/unrankeds.   What the hell is wrong with Riot's matchmaking?  Our collective opinion is that the system is too unwilling to wait more than 20 seconds for a 'better' 5v5 matchup. Instead as we approach the 30s mark in queue, we tend to get worse and worse matchups.   That said, his team regularly taunted us and talked trash, generally douchey and toxic behavior that deserves reports. What kind of person sees that they're matched up against someone of much worse ranking and rubs it in their face? It's such a ridiculous notion. Yeah yeah, it's the internet, toughen up, standard (and irrelevant) responses. Just be a normal person!   And we didn't even do that poorly - our Fizz mid was quite fed, but we were too far behind as a team to win real fights.
0	Pharm tech working for a major pharmacy benefit manager here:   There are ways around that. Have your mom call her insurance and ask about a 'Prior Authorization' form for her doctor to fill out. Basically,  the insurance is working on some set regulations that (under normal circumstances) the medication wouldn't be covered.   If the doc provides adequate medical reason she needs it, most likely it will get covered.
1	People are just too sensitive. If you by any chance just happen to imply someone is doing bad, that player or his friends will do a witch hunt on you... This happened to me yesterday when I told our Jayce what he did wrong and he called in "all" chat that I need to be reported for verbal harassment of the entire team. Sad enough for him, we were 4 premade, so that little lie didn't work out.
1	I think Quinn top (and any other adc with some mobility) will do fine in lane, because youll see mostly tanks/bruisers up there. the big problem with taking any adc top (and why you dont really see it) is because youll most likely have issues once you hit midgame. the enemy toplaner will most likely stack armor which will be doubly effective once you start teamfighting. also that means that your frontline will only consist of your jungle/support IF they pick champs that are beafy enough. I think it'll be pretty hard for your team to win the 5v5 with the current tank meta due to a large amount of high cc/engage those champs possess. I know if I were the enemy toplaner I'd probably just rush thornmail/randuins and try to survive lane/wait for midgame. anyways
1	This is wrong.   You don't need to land your skillshots on your target, so long as the hit something it will work because of his passive. Ez's damage get's enhanced by landing his shots on the appropriate targets, but with a 5 stack of his passive, you will have +60% faster attack speed (compared to Grave's 80% from E) in addition to his actual skill damage.   If you have equivalent items with an Ez/Graves, straight AAing, Graves will win, yes. But the spammability of Ez more than makes up for the difference. And even if you can't hit your main target, you will still keep up your near permanent +60% AS while throwing in constant 300 damage Q-mini-nukes, with a much longer range than Graves' Q.
0	In most states, the ring is a a conditional gift - if you get married, the ring then becomes hers as part of the marriage contract, but if she called of the marriage then she has no right to the ring since she terminated the contract that the ring was a part of. Given the circumstance I can't imagine that a court wouldn't require her to return the ring.  Especially if there is proof she cheated.  Taking  her to small claims court, or even just threatening to do so might do the job.   If it were me, and the cost of taking her to court for the ring ended up being just as much as you could get back for the ring as a return or resale. I'd do it just as a "fuck you" to her.  She doesn't deserve to have the money the ring is worth, so even if you come out even - she sure as hell doesn't since she would have to pay any lawyers she hires as well.  So if you get the ring back and she has to pay extra money for being a scumbag, then that's 2 wins right there. Even if you don't end up making any money back off it.
1	I would have to agree with you that this game SHOULD be about having fun. But it isn't, atleast, Riot doesn't want it to be.   They say so in the Summoner Code. You are not allowed to enjoy this game, if you don't make the other 9 people in your game enjoy their time.   It sounds weird, but it is the truth. I play Malzahar mid, and every single day, i get scolded for not taking Morgana oriana or Karthus etc.   Every day, i get reminded, that i am not allowed to have fun, unless the others in my team want me to. Because your fun does not justify 4 people having a sub par game.   So remember, you CAN have fun in this game, but it is not the MAIN thing anymore.   This is also the reason that people want to go back to the BETA times. There was no meta, and everybody did what he enjoyed.
1	Recently did this myself. My best advice is really just stop caring too much about it. On my last promo series I started off with 2 losses due to afk's or just argumentative teammates. Figuring this series was over I relaxed a bit and just filled for my team (rather than calling a preferred role). Surprisingly won the next 3 games in a row and got promoted!   I'm not saying don't try in ranked, but just relax and it will probably help you play better, as well as ease any sort of tension amongst your teammates. That too, try and help teammates calm down when they get upset and remind your team that mistakes happen, dwindling on those mistakes won't help, and just focus on the next fight. Obviously some people won't listen so mute if necessary. It's better to ignore a teammate than spend minutes at a time typing to one another and lose objectives.
0	I'd direct anyone reading this to the [Irlen wikipedia page]( No scientific research has ever been conducted that proves that:     Irlen syndrome exists       Irlen filters help (people with dyslexia).          It was demoed on TV and then commercialised almost immediately. It reached "fad" status in the 1980s and people were still practising it in the early to mid 1990s. It has regained popularity recently with the Irlen company claiming it helps with ADD and ADHD.   No doubt this will upset someone who "has" the condition, however I'd just redirect you to the research (or lack of) and the fact that after the fad had ended few credible schools still use Irlen filters and even 30+ years later nothing credible has come of any of it.   It only works for "some" dyslexics because it is a placebo. It works because they believe it works. Some research has suggested that it coincidentally helped with unrelated eye disorders that were undiagnosed, and that treating these disorders removes Irlen's claimed benefit in those very few (
1	Actually, if you want to win a game while being 20 cs ahead in low elo it will be hard when the 8/3 ennemy will come in teamfight. Your 9/4 ally will fight too, so you may win this fight, but it won't be that much thanks to you. Your extra longsword will do pratically nothing.   I'm used to play support in low elo, and even while my adc is 7/3, the 10/1 ennemy top lane will come and win the game. At this elo it's way too aggressive to just stay and farm passively.   I sometimes also play on low level smurf, and it's the same. The game the pros play and the one the low level play is different, so the way you should deal with it is different.   I think that sometimes, you should go for an advantage even if you may give one to your opponent. If you have 60% chance to win, then you can try it, and if it fails, then you should play more passive, so that their extra longsword will finally be nothing.
1	Jax is broken as fuck. He beats everyone in lane with the exception of Malphite (There might be some unknown counters that people dont use, enlighten me please.). And against malphite it's actually possible to do good aswell.   I would like to see a nerf on his ulti 3rd strike damage, it is simply too high :(
1	Her Q is pretty useless in bot lane trades as it is only a snare. Her passive is also useless as you wont be W'ing minions to heal up. Her W is useless as it hardly does any dmg if you dont lvl it up and cant use it on the creeps Her shield helps a little bit but again not in any trades bot lane. Her ult is excellent in lane as they are unable to blow you up in time.  After lane you will insta die if you attempt to get into the middle of a fight with support items.
1	Don't get a second BT, you'll just explode and be useless if the enemy team knows what they're doing. One is enough to burst any squishy in a single combo which is your focus as Riven in a team fight.   CDR is only good in prolonged fights and Riven's base CD's are low enough that not building CDR wont impair her effectiveness.   Lucidity boots are only good if you are face rolling your lane and the other team doesn't have much cc. Merc treads or tabi will help you trade and make it harder to kill you. These three are circumstantial though   Iceborne is an awful item on riven for the same reason that frozen mallet is bad, riven has 4 dashes and a stun so you dont need help chasing. If you need health or tankiness there are better items (warmogs/randuins) and the sheen procs don't make up for the lost damage.   I would personally never get a Zeke's Herald on riven but I do see the point you're trying to make. I'd only get it if you and your team are losing since it is very support oriented. Building another damage or defensive item would be much more beneficial.   Mercurial is good as it provides more MR than maw and the QSS active. Maw isn't useless however as it can give more damage and the shield helps prevent getting bursted.   Hydra is pretty bad as other people have mentioned. The active doesn't help all that much seeing as Riven has amazing wave clear to begin with and other items provide better stats for damage. Hydra also doesn't provide any defense which is a pretty big problem.
1	Wow, Garen's build is interesting.  I suspect building MR or damage would be better than a third Warmogs though.  I'm bored so I'm actually going to do the numbers now.  For myself.  For learning.   Without the last Warmogs he probably had about   2183 + 1270 + 1270 = 4723 HP   (67.6 + 68)*1.2 = 162.7 Armor [12407 effective HP]   (52.5 + 76 + 25 + 38)*1.2 = 229.8 MR [15576 effective HP]   100 HP regen/5 [1200/minute = 25% = 25 effective armor/MR per minute] -- Garen's passive gives him 30% extra regen/minute, but only when out of combat.   With the extra Warmogs:   4723 + 1270 = 5993 HP   Same Armor [15744 effective HP]   Same MR [19356 effective HP]   130 HP regen/5 [1560/minute = 26% = 26 effective armor/MR per minute]   Basically - he increased his HP by 27%.  The same effect would come from increasing his armor and MR by 27 each.  My guess is that Garen was trying to counter Cho's true damage ultimate and trying to build enough sustain to survive on the other side of the field... but your own sustain doesn't matter when the enemy has their fountain.   Garen scales really hard with resistances after his remake anyways (20% boost!)   Since you were having trouble with burst (see AP Cho + TF), let's examine how some MR items compare:   Banshee's Veil - 50 MR, 375 HP (+spellshield; who cares about mana)   4723 + 375 = 5098 HP   (191.5 + 50)*1.2 = 289.8 MR [19872 effective HP]   Interesting, it's not that large of a defensive boost actually.  Garen already had super high resistances from his W passive and GA.  Basically he would just get a 1-minute CD spellshield.   But everyone here is suggesting the obvious Atma's, so let's see how that would work:   Garen's Warmogs build - 115.5 AD   Replace Warmogs with Atmas: (115.5 + 4723*1.5%)*1.18 = 186.3*1.18 = 219.9 AD (factoring in crits)   Seeing as Garen's abilities also scale on AD... I now agree it's criminal that Garen passed up this item.  Weirdly, though - it's hardly more of an AD bonus than a Bloodthirster, which provides the sustain he was looking for (and is a lot easier to charge than a Warmogs).  That might have been an even better choice.  Any thoughts?  -- or
0	Well I guess that's your thoughts on the matter.   I have a sister who lives in a different country then me,  that I have seen twice in the last 3 years.  My almost 2 year old nephew only once. She posts funny pictures or videos of new words he says almost daily because a large part of her family isn't there to watch him grow up.  Sometimes there is a lot,  but I don't sit their thinking I'm going to unfriend her. Especially when their is a do not follow button,  and it's my choice to have her updates on my stream.  I know she doesn't post pictures of my nephew for her friends for likes or attention ,  she posts them for our dad (who lives in the same area as me and sees them as much as me) and her siblings.   Anyway,  this is just my experience and I Know it varies.
0	Exactly. Story time! I live in Massachusetts, and my girlfriend (before we were dating) lived in New York. When she lived in New York, we were good friends, and so a couple of times we met up in Montpelier, VT for day trips, since it was about the midpoint for us. One time in particular, we had dinner and drinks at a bar, and had both had quite a bit to drink. The bar closed, so we couldn't stay there, we didn't have a place to stay because we were just staying there did the day, we were too drunk to drive home, and it was too cold to just walk around. So we decided to just wait in her car until we were sober enough to drive home. Fast forward, about 30 minutes of drunk cuddling later, I see this incredibly bright light shine into the car. There's a police man standing next to the car, shining his flashlight right in my face. So I rolled down the window, and explained the situation, and he proceeded to lecture me about why what we were doing was illegal, and how he should give me an OUI, but fortunately he didn't. Oh, and he also threatened to give us a ticket for "camping" in the city... Because we were sitting in a car... I guess he thought we were sleeping in it.
1	You missed the point. Brazilian server means that, without being mistaken, you could complain if someone who doesnt speaks portuguese plays in it.   I know someone like yourself wouldnt play this card because you speak english fine and in hopes of having a good mood around a team you would probably type in english when asking someone like me to do something (i think u get where im going with this).   But the truth is most people wont, solo q will be very bad for many people, solo q is allready hard enough with trolls and people being bad at lol that having a language barrier can only make it harder for some one like me. Add to that that it IS a brazilian server, meaning if i dont speak your language it is me who is in fault, and you have a perfect recipe for someone who is not brazilian to have a bad time.
0	Here is a defense: this is a shit meme that is repeated every time r/atheism is brought up. "I'm an atheist but I'm not one if those atheists." When people post that what are they looking for? A pat on the back from Christians? A "good job, you are so tolerant for unsubscribing?" It's a way to have a superiority complex.   The other defense I have is: in my daily life I run across a lot of pro-Christian shit. From the Christmas music that is on repeat at work (the Jesus-y kind), to random "this is time for a prayer" situations, to random strangers telling me about their faith, to older relatives constantly sending me Jesus chain letters. In America, Christians have a lot of privilege. They get to flaunt their beliefs without most people second guessing it.   Now, I'm not an anti religious atheist. I'm not angry about the Christian shit I deal with. But when people start complaining that one subreddit on one website is "intolerant" or acting like "atheist assholes" you have to really look at the bigger context and ask yourself "is this really that big of a deal?" It's about a big of a deal as Grandma's chain letters.   Sorry for the rant... Uh
1	Woah, woah, woah, Reddit. The youtube comments are being more reasonable about this than you guys are. Take a step back from your judgments and think about where Ocelot has come from. He's not a native English speaker. If you look at what he said without any bias, it's not that hard to realize he meant that people should be more happy, friendly, and optimistic (like he is). Not that people should be like him. Even Sky picked up on the fact that he misspoke, but instead of trying to guide Ocelot to the words he needed, Sky simply turned on him like the way he said it was what he intended to say.   >
1	One of the things most people don't understand: It goes both ways.   Sure, there is a teamfight stage. But generally your top lane (When they're champions like nasus, or jax, or someone who needs A LOT of farm, or split pushes way better.) doesn't have to be there. If you know the nasus isn't there for the "teamfight stage", then don't teamfight. You're not going to change how that nasus plays, but you can change how you play.
0	Background: My wife is nearly fluent in sign language. I, on the other hand, knew almost no sign language when we met. Soon after we got to the 'I love you stage' in our relationship, she started signing it to me. Having noidea how to say 'I love you too' in sign language, I put up two fingers like a peace sign.. AKA the number two. So, this has been a long standing way for us to say 'I love you too.' One says 'I love you' and the other just says or signs 'two.'   Now, our two year old has apparently picked up on this. Because she likes to randomly throughout the day say 'Two mama' or 'Two dada.' Naturally, our hearts melt and we respond with 'Love you too, kiddo.'
0	Storytime! I met this girl at a small birthday party thing, we ended up singing random classic rock song duets. Meet up several times in the next few months, turns out music is pretty much the only common interest, so we just trade music a lot online. A couple of months later she gets engaged (o0), which is fine as neither of us ever brought up dating (though it did cross my mind a few times).   End of the story is her sister is a tri-lingual book nerd with a wit you could use for shaving. Oh, and her parents really like me so I've been invited to stay at their house for a family weekend later this month.
0	They are, more so than most give them credit for. There is a singularly break from reality which creates the situation under which a mass shooting is the rational response to their circumstance. The rest proceeds as rational and logical.   One thing a person's mind shifts. Be it the need to be remembered, or the expression of pain, or the desire to spread their ideology, something becomes more valuable than human life. That person then logically and rationally decides how best to spread the higher priority. Higher body counts generate more interest, so they'll target locations where higher body counts are easier to get.  There are other ways they can approach it of course, such as murdering the famous or attacking unique difficult targets (such as police officers), but they are harder to execute, and so less likely.
1	Your whole team had positive win loss ratios and most of their team had negative ratios.  Clearly your team is climbing ladder while they're mostly stuck in gV.  No wonder you got matched
0	I guess my point wasn't to make a guide; I was just throwing out some thoughts. But I'll elaborate in a more guide-like manner. I'll continue from here:   >  It's okay to walk up to someone with a smile, hold out your hand and introduce yourself.   Where are you? What do you have in common and what about that do you not have in common? If you are students, you have that in common. But what are you each studying?   If you are at a concert, introduce yourself with a smile. Ask if she's excited for the show. Make conversation about that.   If you're at a bar or a club, introduce yourself with a smile and ask how her night is going so far. If it's bad and she wants to vent, it's off to a weird start for you, but listen sympathetically if you haven't already lost interest. If it's bad and she doesn't want to really talk about it, offer to buy her a drink (in front of her, so that she doesn't think you roofied it). You probably won't approach someone who looks furious or miserable though, so on to if she is having a good night. She'll probably ask how your night is going. Answer and move on to, for example, if she goes there often and/or if she lives around there. Conversation at this point usually just flows.   Another way to make conversation at clubs/lounges/bars (in areas that aren't so loud that nobody can hear each other): You're probably there with your friends. You're having a conversation about something and there's a cute girl in a group next to you, and you've been wise enough to observe for a bit to make sure she doesn't have a 7-foot, 250 lb. boyfriend who could pulverize you with his thumb. A restaurant, a city, a hookah bar is what is being discussed. Whatever. This sounds especially natural if you are emphatic about how great something is and if she can overhear your conversation. You turn to her and ask her if she has been there or done that and what she thinks. Just make her a part of the conversation you're having. In my experience, I have found that groups merge more naturally in lounge type settings than in bars, but YMMV.   If you're approaching someone in a park, just talk about how beautiful of a day it is or a cute animal that you saw. I'm not sure how many redditors approach people in parks, so I'll leave it at that.   While making conversation with her, it might help to talk about places and things to do in the area. That way, you can segue in a least awkward manner into asking if she would like to check it out with you and you won't be in a weird situation where you're talking about fried eggplants one second and then asking her to be your date to your brother's wedding the next.
0	My cousin, we'll call him Aaron, was a total dick when we were kids and got humped by our dog Buddy. Aaron was in the process of chasing my brother onto our lawn trying to pick a fight when he tripped and Buddy mounted him. Aaron kept saying "he thinks he's my backpack!" Buddy just went to town on him, we didn't let him live that down for a few years.
0	I wanted to upvote this, but then I looked at your comment history and saw that this was almost all that you post. So then I decided on downvoting you. However, after clicking downvote, I thought to myself "Well, reddit does involve a lot of reposts, and hey, maybe someone hasn't read this yet!". So then I clicked upvote. However, I'm thinking, "Man, you need to be more creative" so I downvoted. But now, I see that you did take the time to type it out, so were back to upvote.
0	Aberrant isn't a single end state. It describes any behavior that is off the norm. In any case, there would be no distinction between aberrated and aberrant. You've conveyed no additional meaning, since it's not a word that is used by anyone else.   And describing a word that no one else uses as a neologism is a bit arrogant.
0	Ok, here is the thing... I've been a frustrated young adult male since 17... It was especially horrid when I saw my same age half brother easily maneuver his way through the bedrooms of a dozen beautiful art students. The feelings of jealousy and resentment I had fed my ego until it actually burst. For five years he dated a beautiful fashion model and the hate I could never show was palpable.   I would get drunk and throw wild fits of rage at this and many other life issues... All I could think about was "Why not me?" and I felt shitty for it, because acheiving the successes I thought I needed seemed nearly impossible.   This bred resentment to attractive women and made me hate myself to the point of futility. I simply gave up and spent four years gaming and toking until I nearly fried myself. I also drank and sometimes did other drugs, but never to a point of danger. I still managed to make and maintain friendships, because I forced myself to be social despite a stutter and dismal self esteem. I never went to school and didn't bother to develop any useful skills, other than making great first impressions at job interviews, working out and a bit of writing.   Still, I felt inadequate. I tried Pick Up in a futile attempt to reconcile my painful lack of love life, only to realize I was learning how to be fake and creepy.   I second guessed everything I ever said and every action I ever took. My friends all called me "Friendzone" and laughed at me. They even made 50+ Suicidal Damir memes, which can be located on quickmeme.   Still... It all changed... I finally realized that life is NOT about me... If you want love from the person you want, you have to love yourself first. You're good at certain things, most likely have two arms, two legs and a mouth... What can't you accomplish?   I decided I was going to be grateful for all the rejection... That I would be proud of having female friends who would never sleep with me, and that I would treat them like I want to be treated! Guess what happened? Everything changed. I started seeing a counselor, which helped me tremendously, and began to let go of guilt, shame and resentment. My life changed.   Women are people who, like you, feel insecure, isolated and shitty at times. They feel emotions at a deeper level than us males, at times,  and therefore need compassion and a good listener. They do not deserve to be used or labelled simply based on their appearance. Next time you talk with a woman, any woman, even your mom, ask her about the qualities they appreciate in men... This way you can work on yourself to become a person worthy of the partner of your dreams. That's what happened to me, and guess what, she is NOT scumbag Stacey.   Msg me if you ever want to talk or need advice! I know how you feel!
0	That kind of reminds me of the first time I was in the OP's situation as the customer.  I was in some store early in the morning (maybe Home Depot) and I was buying a $2 item and they ask if I want cash back when I pay with my debit card.  This was way before self swipe was a thing.  I said "yeah, sure how much can I get?"  I knew I needed to hit the ATM anyway so I tried to take the max out hoping to avoid another trip.  The cashier obliged but said they didn't have enough in the till and would have to call over a manager.  I told them not to worry about it and I would just make the extra stop.  I've been slightly more conscious of doing that lately but not much.
1	We all know what is the stereotype about Poland and the British government approach to that, of course it's our fault English people don't have jobs because we take them, sadly nobody mentions the fact that we create them as well. He maybe tried to make it amusing but  apparently it is clearly seen it's his serious opinion.   Congratulations on not watching the video and seeing the asian host being late and Thoorin saying "well, I'm going to be racist now since I'm pissed, I thought asian people were good at math", it was just friendly banter, these people are friends with each other for what, 15 years. If you GENUINELY think he's a racist/thinks polish people are stealing jobs (where the fuck do you see that in his remarks) then you are an overly patriotic, nationalist nutcase who shouldn't even be allowed to be on this subreddit.   And seeing the pictures you linked just confirms that. He has nothing to apologize for, he called your country a shithole referring to infrastructure and living standards, which is OBJECTIVELY TRUE. Those are much lower than in Germany/Britain or whatever the fuck. He didn't say shit about polish people. Grow the hell up. I live in Germany and I wouldn't want to live in Poland either, COMPARED TO WHERE I LIVE it's a shithole, while this is a harsh word it doesn't mean that I hate the polish citizens, obviously that would be absurd.
0	Well that was less than a year ago so that is definitely a spoiler.
0	I did this a few years ago.  Switched from IT Staffing to Internet Marketing.  My advise is to start by doing you passion on the side, after hours, on the weekends, while saving as much as you can.  Quit your job once you have enough savings that you'd be comfortable surviving for at least 6 months with the expectation that you won't be earning any other money.  Hopefully your passion has been bringing in some income while you've been doing it on the side which you can scale once you've transitioned to doing it full time.  It also helps to have a backup plan in the event your passion doesn't earn you enough money to survive.  My IT Staffing experience was fairly in-demand so I knew that I'd easily be able to find another job if working on my own didn't work out.   My dad gave me the best advice.  When you work for yourself, your savings is like an hour glass.  Every month more sand is falling out.  Each time you make money it's like taking a scoop from the bottom and adding back to the top.   You know you've made it once you have more sand being added to the top than falls out each month.
1	Depending on the item being purchased and how many GP/10 items you have, you might even wait for up to 100 gold.   *edit: here's my reasoning.   If you're a support (gets all their gold from GP10 anyway) and you have enough GP10 to get you an item quicker if you wait than if you stay in lane, as long as your carry doesn't really need you around, your carry will get more experience while you're away. So as the support, you're giving your carry experience while you attempt to get another item sooner.   (
1	Finally this issue reaches top page. plz riot, fix this! btw, in case u are trying to find a way to go around this bug, if u reset all the keybindings before u change them, the game wont crash. this doesnt fix the problem since u dont necessarily want ur keybindings to be reset, and have to change them all the games u make, but atleast it allows us to change keybindings without the game crashing
1	As a first year teacher in the US I do agree the standards of education are not what they used to be say ten years ago. One of the biggest impacts of this is from government employees that have no stepped into a classroom in many years ( most cases never being a teacher themselves ) are making the content requirements for students. The US is shifting towards the Common Core Standards ( which is glorified Standardize testing workshops). However, it all depends on how much effort a teacher puts into lessons that can determine how much a student achieve.  However, I don't get to see the entire structure as I work with students with special needs. Someone who is a General Education teacher can fill in blanks that I may have left out.
1	ADC main here. This is all well and good and I know I would be nothing without my support, but can I just say something? If I buy a ward because I feel you're not warding enough or that you have yet to buy a pink to clear out enemy wards, don't take it the wrong way. I am trying to help you help me. Every game where I have bought wards as an ADC, my supports have raged at me. Sorry for helping you out.

0	Similar story: I was at my local coffee shop and ordered a dark roast. It just so happened to be the last one in the big pot thing they have. The girl behind me also ordered a dark roast and the barista told her it would be 5 or so minutes. It was clear she didn't have the time to wait. As I had just received mine and hadn't done anything to it I told her to have mine and just pay for another and I would wait. The barista asked for my frequent buyer card and marked off 3 rows of free ones. Being nice pays off. If this was a porn we would've had a 3some.
1	Devil's advocate list of points. -In regards to point one. I have three accounts all diamond. The last two took me about 60 hours of play time for each to hit thirty. A fairly small investment and I gained a lot of insight into my own play and also as far as "stomping people" if you play to the best of your ability every game you will quickly be matched against players of your own skill level in around 20 games or less.     In regards to #2. The black market will always offer a better product. A clean account with no connection to your main account is preferable to one that is connected even if you're not a toxic player. Also having the ip from the bot or person leveling the account will be more useful than a fresh thirty. There are many points but regardless I could go on forever about the impossible difficulty to handle the black market for riot.   In regards to smurfing being no fun. Think about these points.  You can use it as an account you play to meet people in soloque who are new and take a deeper look at how you can leave a positive influence on your team in a variety of personality clashes. You can also roleplay such as myself with one of my accounts Firsttime Aatrox where I have literally never played a single game that wasn't Aatrox. -In regards ""no more smurfs that troll/afk/are toxic in general with the excuse...." Giving the players this option to buy a fresh thirty does not eliminate this problem in any way. Toxic people such as this will still buy black market accounts to have a immunity to account linked toxicity punishment.     In regards to it improving player experiences. I believe some of my best experiences lately have happened on my smurf. There are several reasons for this. On my main I have people I've known since beta after awhile many of them find the elo their spot in the ladder. As someone who is still striving to be better and climbing towards challenger I regretfully cannot play a competitive game with many of these friends. However, on my smurf my friends list is full of people that climbed with a high winrate that I met in soloque who are a lot closer to my skill level. This allows new friendships and synergistic duoing beast mode sessions to happen.
1	Based off the linked video, the only problem I see is the visual story telling is getting in its own way. I enjoy seeing the players talk, but when they start talking about something that happened in game, there was only twice in the video when you cut to the actual event, and in each case, it didn't feel like the whole moment was shown. This made me feel a bit frustrated- I realize the editing was done around the interview, however it felt like more of sequence they were talking about could have been included. For instance, you cut to the shot at Baron, but didn't stay through to the end of the fight, or even end at a natural ending point in the middle of the fight- it felt jarring, and I wanted to see HOW the fight played out, not just cut back to Hotshot telling me that they won it. They video cut out right after the initiation- not even enough time to see any advantages from either team. I don't know if the video was available, but when Hotshot talked about buying extra pots, even a split screen shot or an extra frame of that moment in game helps show the story, and break up the visual monatany. I think you were trying to do that by having the info on builds and game stats- which is awesome, but doesn't help tell the story.
1	I wrote  a post last week . I enjoy Diana as she is, but she is a niche bully pick (necessitating her need to get ahead, like Vesh said).   I don't believe she needs changes to be more autoattack oriented. While Vesh didn't explicitly say this, it was implied this could be the new direction she is taken. Nashor's Tooth is  incredibly  cost efficient (+1000g in free stats and free passive) and any Diana rework would put her over the top.   A nashor first Diana is really strong, but it isn't about being an autoattack hero. It's more of a "I'm going to try to dominate anyone 1v1 sub30minutes" item. I suppose you could go Nashor+Gauntlet and pretend to be some AP fighter, but I only remember going gauntlet in a single game where the enemy team went out of their way to encourage it. Typically you would follow up with a Lich Bane in line with the burst assassin line of thought.
0	I have been working in the gym industry for about five years now. I'm no professional, but I typically clock in about 40 hours a week working (on top of my typical 1-3 hour sessions [depends on if I do cardio/eat mid workout]). This puts me in the ballpark of 50+ hours a week spent at a gym learning all that I can through reading books and just simple trial and error. I am not at all a professional in this field (I used to compete in power lifting, and am starting to dabble into body building a good bit), but I would say that I could successfully manage a gym fairly successfully.   With all that being said, I do not think that a gym is a play that anyone under the age of 18 should be without proper direction or coaching at constant time. From a logistical standpoint, it can be dangerous to their health in more ways than one. Piled onto that the immaturity level of  most  people (at least in lower Alabama) under the age of 18, it is just a dangerous composition. It can, as op stated, a complete devastation to the already minimal ego of an individual that is trying to turn their life around. To quote a rather silly sub (/r/swoleacceptance ), you must first be swole of the mind, before you can be swole of the body.

1	Well if you were diamond or plat and just couldnt do anything because you werent trying your complete hardest to the max wouldnt you want to play against lower people so you can actually have a little fun playing the game and not have to worry about having to try super hard to actually do good.
1	Its disconcerting how people are acting in the thread.  I can try and make discusssion but its hard to articulate what i want so ill ramble and hope it comes out as id like it to.   I honestly can't tell anything from this switch till i see it.  Xmithie in soloq is actually a pretty huge rager, so his play looks worse in general, and soloq isnt a great indication of how good a person does in competitive play (with an easy example being mancloud being routinely camped in soloq because he pushes out early since its better for competitive but not having the countergank pressure a team environment provides lets him die pretty often).  However xmithie in terms of talent is slightly overrated.  I feel like theyre trying to make this an xpecial/turtle lane, when i think overall skill level its closer to a wiz/dream lane.  Solid but not overpowering.  From what ive picked up of interviews and small bits of scrim "listen ins" is that xmithie is fairly quiet except for calls themselves so bloodwater has to communicate lane pushing, overall health, timers, to the rest of the team, so trading/kill scenarios may be effected if they dont get enough synergy together   Ive seen zuna stream multiple times and hes pretty good at identifying the problem and putting a solution pretty quickly but i feel like he falls short in execution due to not actually enjoying soloq enough to practice mechanics.  I feel as though hes a bit like chauster was, enjoying competitive league, but not the game itself so he faulters in what should be instant reactions for someone spamming games.   Its a tough spot, but i feel like their early game is more heavily impacted from mancloud and bloodwater knowing their kill pressure, and putting benny under more pressure top usually forsaking it, to allow risks in the 2v2 and mid.  I dont ever believe it came from xmithies raw mechanical talent delivering kills. First split they admitted to mostly microing xmithie but were never known for early game, but rather incredible pick/ban and lategame comps, and second split when he took inititive to make more anticipatory calls they got the reputation for great early game.   Basically i feel like this is xdg trying to emulate the style of tsm, by having a really consistent top, kill pressure mid, and focusing the bottom half of the map as necessary to pick up objectives like dragon or early turrets.  I also feel like zunas indifference to soloq will be reflected IF major jungle changes take shape.  Vi, Eve, Olaf, Elise, Lee are mostly the meta champs, and zuna fairs better on the tanky ones.  If snowball jungles become popular, zuna may well be the cause of burden on his team, needing to be higher priority in kill taking might be detrimental to him.
0	I was always the weird skinny kid in high school that got picked last in PE. 'Round came flag football and some poor team got stuck with me.  Not long into the first game, however, the ball got thrown to me. I caught it and did the only thing in the sport that I knew how to do: I ran it. I outran those behind me and jumped over those in front of me all the way to the endzone.  And this happened every time I got the ball. Soon enough, my team had nicknamed me Freight Train because I was "unstoppable."  It was one of the more bizzare nicknames I ever had, but it was acceptable. I'm not quite sure why anyone would  want  to be called that, though.
0	And ... they stay in the fast lane for miles, then do this to get over at the last possible moment, just feet from their offramp.  Obviously a personality defect ... No patience, and they seem to think this will make their life somehow better, to save two seconds no matter what the risk.  I wish they'd crash, or at least get jailed for this kind of dangerous behavior.

1	We also have to realize we have more interaction with the sports scene than any other sport out there; every other sport usually has contained instances of interactions between the players and the community, whether that's sporting events or media forums, but League has streaming which is direct interaction between viewers and the streamers. After that, the players themselves are much more interactive with the community on forums such as Reddit and it's something we as a community take for granted, because these are players who do not usually go through a college scene or some other format of integration into the professional scene that can screen them and train them to take the criticism of the community; instead, they are either up there and known, or they are not. We need to realize this, and as we grow in the esports format give them the respect they deserve for playing in the format they do, while also making sure that when we do critique them, it isn't just mindless insults but rather real, backed up choices. Yes, Wickd has made some questionable choices/builds, but honestly, it makes the games more entertaining than the static builds the meta enforces and I'll take that any day over just watching the same basic, boring game played over and over again with different names over the same champs.

1	Do you think about limiting duo option only for people in similar mmr?   Now it's hard to win a match when eg. diamond duo with bronze/silver becouse this diamond is obviously higher mmr then other team but all other people are lower it means that 4/3 poeple will probably lose laning phase and perform worse in team fights and it's only up to high elo player to make up for his team mistakes

I have Challenger friends (who I met on reddit) who tell me that I play really well and should be at least Diamond 4+.   But every single time my teammates feed, and feed and they feed some more like their trying to FUCKING FEED THE WORLD. Like, holy shit please stop, I'm actually trying to win the game. They feed at lvl 1 and then report me when i afk and/or tell them how much they suck (which is true). Idk why rito banned me pls, i dont deserve tis i desrve dimod.

0	The whole idea of thermodynamics is that everything is moving all the time and there is no absolute position. So traveling "in time" would not fix the time machines location to a meaningless spot where the time machine used to be because that position means nothing without an observer to locate it. If you were inside the time machine (even if its a watch or something) the location of your ultimate destination is  affected by the atoms in your vicinity which are tracking your motion.   The atoms that would undergo backwards decay announcing your location would lower the universes entropy to a stand still and the electromagnetic force would force the universe to move all around you and the time machine. You would control the fate of the universe so you will be the center of it causing no misplacement and essentially once your bodys atoms have reached there "backwards" destination, would release the universes entropy back into your body causing you to explode. But your gravity will hold everything together because your location cannot be changed. This is because everything is frozen looking at you   But your surroundings wouldnt move.   Im a physicist
1	People don't listen to shit Froskurinn says because historically, every thing she has said in regards of trash talking players is baseless and ultimately can not be further from the truth.   Her hard on for Namei and saying that he's "the best ADC in the world" is laughable, the guy didn't even show up for a single game at worlds.   Also, there is no way that a non-Korean team will win worlds next year.  China can take as many players that they want, but they will never be able to replicate the Korean team infrastructure and coaching.
1	ASSUMING it's true you can kill a ward, it would still be unfair to remove the temporary invulnerability of the minions.   If someone were to TP into a fight using a minion, an enemy would instantly see the minion, and have 3.5 seconds to kill it. Not having to use a sweeper, and also beeing allowed to use spells makes 3.5 seconds a hell of a long time to kill a single minion (except superminions). Just imagine Ziggs throwing a single bomb 700 range away and instantly the TP threat is nullified.   The wards on the other hand can be placed everywhere. Movig to the location of the ward that's beeing TP'd on, dropping the sweeper and killing it is alot to do in 3.5 seconds, considering there's most likely enemies nearby ready to kill you if you waste your attacks in the middle of a skirmish.
1	Math is quite simple, if you are as pro as you say you are then there is only 44% chance that a troll/bad player will be on your team where as there would be 55% chance that a troll/bad player will be on the enemy team, meaning you should win more games than you lose. Matchmaking doesn't hate you. I know, sounds crazy, but its true.
1	She has 3 steroids built into her kit that aid in her auto attacks. Her W, gives her 3rd consecutive auto-attack on 1 target guaranteed bonus dmg plus her base AD, her Q gives her 60% more dmg on her next auto-attack, her ult grants her bonus attack damage. Name any other AD carry that has 3 AD steroids in their kit (outside of twitch, which I've never understood why people think he is troll, but that's a whole other issue).     Cait: 1 in passive   Ashe: None   Corki: None   Ezreal: 1 in passive   Graves: 1 in E   Kog'Maw: 2 in Q-passive and W   Sivir: 2 in W and R   Teemo: 2 in passive and E   Tristana: 1 in Q   Twisted Fate: 1 in E   Twitch: 3 in passive, Q, and R   Urgot: None     Please note that twitch is also a crazy hyper-carry similar to Vayne. However, a full-item build twitch can wreck your team in 3 seconds compared to a vayne having to take out each individual target one at a time. The thing people fail to realize about Twitch is that his Ult applies every single on-hit effect. Crits, Item Slows, Red Slows, and his Passive, all get applied in his ult. There is no dmg reduction in how many targets he hits, if he hits you with his ult missle it is the same as if he hit you with his basic auto-attacks.
1	Not to be a dick to my friends but one of my friends is a Platinum player and the other a Silver player. Silver friend (we're all friends together IRL by the way) attempts to get his account boosted by having the Plat friend go to his house and playing  for him . Yep. He doesn't go home and boost for him, he's there sitting beside him.   He only raised one rank division because he loses so many games in a row, thus demoting him. It's hilarious to see his MMR boosting working and then not working because he's an entirely terrible player.   What does Riot have to say about this though?
0	Okay, he said "I get dirty looks for..." and you're calling BS, but had he phrased it "I have gotten dirty looks for..." you wouldn't have objected? Have I gotten that right?   If so, you might want to be a bit more careful to avoid inferring things which have not been implied.   To expand on that, despite your apparent inference, "I get [x]s" does not denote how frequently [x] happens - the most one can infer absent further context is that it has happened on more than one occasion, and that at least one such occasion was sufficiently recent that the speaker can reasonably assume it will occur in the future under similar circumstances.   Neither "rarely" nor "sometimes", nor "regularly", nor "frequently", are implied. It could have been any of those based on the comment to which you were replying.   Also, regarding:   > Because I live in the real world   From a quick glance at your comment history, it seems you're Danish. Of course shit like this is pretty much implausible in Denmark - I've been there, I know firsthand you guys are extremely level-headed compared to "normal" people here in the US, much less our suburbanite soccer/hockey moms who are needlessly and excessively paranoid about their children as a product of being taught slogans such as "[stranger danger]( while growing up. Unfortunately, we're in the real world as well, just opposite sides thereof, and things are a bit different here - when you couple the aforementioned "stranger danger" propaganda with various facts and statistics, such as...     45-50+% of all marriages end in divorce, separation, annulment, etc^1   29% of marriages wherein the woman was under 44 years old and it was her first marriage end in divorce within 10 years,^2   laws effectively favor the mother over the father in the event of disputed custody:   where primary custody is concerned (i.e. there is some joint custody or visitation arrangement), mothers outnumber fathers 5 to 1,^3   Note: I apologize because I can't seem to locate the numbers right now, but I do recall from the last time I had to look up these numbers that it goes up significantly where sole custody (no joint legal or physical custody, no visitation) is concerned. Something like 10 to 1, sole custody mothers outnumber sole custody fathers.         ...you can see that single fathers aren't terribly common (and they're very uncommon in suburbia, particularly if the father isn't particularly well-dressed since there's a presumption that a "poor" father would be far less likely to win custody), and sometimes one of these paranoiacs sees a man with a child and freaks out, sometimes even calling the cops on the man.^4 This can be much worse when race is a factor (that is, the father and child appear to be of different races e.g. the video above, or /u/shogo elsewhere in this thread, who said he looks Puerto Rican and his daughter is pale-skinned with blonde hair and blue eyes).   Hope this helps clear things up for you!
1	I think the use of kill stealing is just used incorrectly. I think thst securing the kill is more important than anything. I have been a sucker for being good guy support/jungler, trying to let my laner last hit the kill and they get away. A lot of this anger has to do witb egoism where every individual has the mindset that the gold is.always better on them because they are the only competent player. The only important thing to is assess how valuable the kill is to an individual. I.E i succesfully counter gank enemy jungler mid and he is about to die with buffs. Do you want that gold to carry or do you want to pass over the enemy double buffs to your laner to give him a HUGE edge mid. other things like trying to give shutdown bonuses to carries is nice too.   In my eyes, a kill steal would be something like you blatantly crushing the enemy in a 1v1 and you put the ignite on the enemy and someone just randomly comes to last hit the champion beefore the ignite kills him. The context that most kids use it is that they want the gold to carry so they throw a tantrum in chat.
1	And my only other irritation with this thread is the people that say they're embarrassed to show this game to their girl friends?   It's not about a lack of realism, it's about looking at Janna in a wind bikini and realizing immediately that the target audience is overly hormonal teenage boys. They look at Sivir and they know right away, more than "pretty" it is "sexy". The adjectives lean away from "lovely, graceful, beautiful," and most notably, TASTEFUL.   Unfair for you to say that we're complaining about realism because I game and my friends game, too, but not usually MOBAs. Contrast the outfits of say, Sivir/Sejuani/Shyvana with how absolutely flipping beautiful say, Princess Zelda looked in Twilight Princess and you'll see what I'm talking about.
1	Because people are scared of him. Protip: Don't ban him, then counterpick the terribad enemy first pick who immediately grabs him. Wipe the floor with their smug little face.   Stupidest part of ranked, even at 1570 ELO, is that people always first or second pick top and mid lane. Because of that you have very little room for counter-picking obvious counter-able matchups, and champion's whos balance is held in check by easy, obvious counter-picking get really strong. Enemy team picked kassadin? Shove a Talon/Pantheon/Caitlyn up his ass.
1	I don't think EG is losing because of communication issues.   I think split pushing with a 3-0 Jax yesterday was the right call. I also think getting an early lead and then turning that into ward control over baron to bait it out is also the right call today and yesterday against a Nidalee.   But the reason they lost was because Innox played too timid and because Krepo can't land anything when baiting. He's like 0-6 for point blank hooks + bindings when EG is baiting out baron. Had he landed something, EG could have converted it to a baron and would have made it much easier to close out the game.
0	Fuck. I was that kid in middle school. I had a friend from my after school homework center place lend me his gundam wing game for PS1. I ended up losing it so I went to funcoland to try and get him another copy. The game costs $40, which was a fortune at the time and I couldn't afford it (this is when i decided to screw him over). I told him I lost the game and that ebay had a used copy for cheap and my older brother ordered it for me and it should come in a few days, it was during the last week of school. I played it off and ditched the last day so I wouldn't have to face him. I told my mom the homework center was just having a party for the last day and it wasn't mandatory to come.   Every once in a while I would remember this and fucking hate myself for it. The worse part about it was that this guy was nothing but nice to everyone. Kids would pick on him and he would still be their friend after.   Fast forward like 10 years. I was at a New Year Rave, some guy tap me on the back and holy shit it was this dude! It was a rave so we were both probably pretty fucked up and forgot about it. Still, this guy came up to me and hung out with me even after I pulled a dick move and jacked his game. A few days later I would again remember the game and regret the missed opportunity.   By some miracle many years later I had an art class with him. He recognize me and we had some small talk and it was one of those situation where he knows I jacked his game and I definitely know I jacked his game but never once did he brought it up. He even gave me his number to call in case I miss a class and needed the day's assignment. I knew that this was my chance to make it right. I waited for him after class. Honestly it was like trying to ask a girl out. I even practiced what I had to say, "Hey man, remember at the homework center we used to go to and that one time you let me borrow your gundam game? I totally jacked it from you dude and I feel terrible." he said that it was cool and just to forget about it. I insisted on getting him a new game, he didn't want it, but I insisted. I ended up getting him a new copy of L.A Noire. Feels good man.
1	In this case, 'mechanics' is more than knowing how/what to build for your character, or knowing how to play them. Mechanics means things like last hitting minions, knowing when/how to initiate teamfights, and knowing how to position yourself throughout the teamfight to be safe and do the most damage to the targets that need to be targeted.   Positioning comes through a lot of focus during your games, and will improve with time as you try to improve it.   Last hitting minions though, you can practice by yourself. Create an empty custom match and practice last hitting minions (only last hitting, don't push the lane if you can help it). Try to set goals, like 100 cs at 15:00. When you can achieve this, add a bot to the match to practice last hitting when there is unintelligent, aggressive harass. When you can do this fairly consistently, jump back into matchmaking, and you will outfarm, outbuilt, and outplay your opponents. I doubt many people at 500 elo hit 100 cs before 20 minutes. In your last ten games, you only have two matches with more than 100 cs at all.   You also mention that you rarely rage, but in your last ten games, you have two matches where you obviously trolled and bought 6 boots, and one leave. You won't reach your "true" elo if you troll or leave in 30% of your games.
1	The more trolls you have at your Elo the more you'll win.  Assuming that you never leave the other team will have more AFKers than you as they have 5 possible leavers while you only have 4.  This maths works for any value of  x  but let's assume you have a leaver or troll on your team once every 4 games. You will have an AFK player on the other team once every 3.2 games compared to your 4 games. Therefore over the long term you will be gaining Elo from people being AFK.   Maths:     x  = Chance of a player leaving = 1/16 (If you have 1 AFK in 4 games this means that one of the 16 people you played with is an AFKer. 16 because out of the 40 players in 4 games 20 are on the opposing team and 4 of them are you. 40-20-4=16)     You:  4 x  = 25%     Them: 5 x  = 31.25%     They therefore have more AFKers than you.       Or put another way assuming a 50% win rate in any fair games without trolls:     0.25 = AFK Loss   0.3125 = AFK Win   1-0.25-0.3125 = Normal Game = 0.4375  Therefore     Win = 0.4375/2 + 0.3125 = 0.53125   Loss = 0.4375/2 + 0.25 = 0.46875  So if he wins 50% of the fair games he will gain Elo due to having an actual win percentage of  53.13% .
1	Riot needs to find a way to fix it, Like make the leveling Estimate your elo not all people start at 1200   Ever heard of placement matches?   This has nothing to do with people who "just turned 30". People who reached level 30 earned the right to play ranked, and not letting them play ranked is ridiculous.
0	I hate to break it to everyone, but a lot of those "bullshit" tests are actually very valid.   I'm finishing a PhD in Industrial/Organizational Psychology, and we're the ones who develop those tests. Lots and lots of time (incumbent and other subject matter expert interviews, surveys, focus groups, direct observation) goes into assembling a complete and accurate description of the job and what knowledge/skills/abilities/other things (KSAOs) are important for success. Then we develop tests that tap into those KSAOs.   The test is then validated by administering it and connecting the results to actual performance on the job. Because of strict laws in the US, we also do lots and lots of analyses to ensure the test doesn't have adverse impact on any minority population.   Anyway... even if you don't see the validity in a test, it's probably there. Strongly endorsing every question would probably get you kicked out of the applicant pool for lying, so that's probably not why you whiners weren't chosen... that was because there was another applicant who was a better fit.
1	According to the lore,   "The story of Doran tugs at the heartstrings. They say Effrem E. Doran was born with a hammer in his hands and a forge in his heart. Every object he touched, he found ways to improve, and he knew that he was destined to be a brilliant artificer. At the age of 15, he was invited to the League with an offer to assume the role of Master Artificer, a dream come true and an unprecedented honor for one so young. However, fate had other plans. En route, his carriage broke an axle. When he leaned down to inspect it, he was kicked in the head by his donkey, a stern blow. He stumbled back onto the wagon, but when he arrived at the Institute of War he was a different boy. The kick had rendered his mind soft, but it hadn’t robbed him of his passion. He still wanted nothing other than to craft, but where once he may have created singular masterpieces, he now crafted…somewhat simpler items, and many of them. He is a kind, goofy, good-hearted soul, and he takes pride in the work he does. His items are daily selected by champions on the Fields of Justice, and he has a permanent home at the Institute."
1	I play mostly solo top offtank and the occasional jungle udyr, so can anyone enlighten me a bit on what the required runes are for this build? I know I can jungle with udyr and WW without very many runes, but ive tried jungling with noc and I just kinda die..... and I DO know how to position his Q to land all the creeps. And what about in lane?
0	When I was 8 or 9 I heard a catchy jingle for Trojan condoms on the local top 40 radio. I had no idea what it was for (had a vague idea it had to do with 'accessories') but it played all the time and the DJ's thought it was hilarious.   So of course I ran around singing the chorus "what about Trojan?" for a few days thinking I was in on a fun grown-up joke. Until my parents heard and sat me down for a very instructive talk. Stopped singing it after that but it was embarrassing moment for all of us.
1	Well you have to think about some things.     Corki had jsut gotten ot the fight fresh while CLG had no ults left   The 3 near death on WE's side were really only tanks/some dps, while Ezreal was abotu to have his GA popped   Based on Ezreals position, when he came back up he would have been insta killed by Corki/WE   With Ezreal down it would have come down to Oriana to clean up the rest of WE, 2-3 of whom have GA i believe
0	While I might agree with you in reference to a fairly strict adherence to English language construction, I must ultimately disagree.  LEGO is a brand, and is most definitely not a noun.  It's more correct to call it an adjective.  They are LEGO bricks, or parts.  Specific collections of bricks are called LEGO sets.   But this is the English language, which is fluid and changing all of the time.  We mold it to our usage as we see fit, and if enough people use the changes, it becomes part of our lexicon.  If you don't believe me, text your friends about the usage of "text" as a verb, and how awesome your Nikes are.   LEGO put a notice on their website a while back (which I believe is no longer there -- I leave it to the reader to verify) stating:   > Please always refer to our products as “LEGO bricks or toys” and not “LEGOS.” By doing so, you will be helping to protect and preserve a brand of which we are very proud, and that stands for quality the world over   Many of you may look at this as the deciding factor in this argument.  If you are writing a book on LEGO, or an article in a magazine, I would agree with you.  However, this is a company trying to protect its brand.  They have no jurisdiction over the use of the English language in everyday conversation.   "Legos" is used widely enough to be accepted by most people.  And because the entire purpose of language is to use words to convey a thought, as long as you picture LEGO^® Bricks in your head when I say "Legos," mission accomplished.   Besides... are you going to tell THAT kid the proper usage of the term LEGO?   Source: I'm a writer, plus Google.
1	While true, this doesn't mean you're suddenly not copying Protato anymore, it's still nearly identical and you'll most likely remain in his shadow. The constant champion taunts and joke spams were unnecessary and frankly just a tad annoying.   I'd suggest listening to Nristu, find your own niche or speciality, something that sets you apart. The lack of commentary during the games doesn't differentiate all that much, if all it makes your variation seem even cheaper.
0	My mom is the same. She constantly brags about her ability to "not let her past ruin her present." But then she will spend the next hour telling me how hard it was that her parents didn't love her (which they completely did, they just didn't show it). If I ask her advice on friends, or simply vent about anything from a bad day at work to being ditched by a friend, she turns it into how hard her life has been since she discovered her food allergy, or she'll remind me how absurdly awful her college roommates were.  She spends her days sleeping on the couch and being bitter about almost every aspect of her life. Whenever I need her, she's not there because she's stuck in the past.  Almost any time I give her a piece of good news, she finds a way to change the subject to the fact that her mother in law has Alzheimer's and how I'll never see her again. I can't stand being with my own mother.
1	Disagree. They are rebuilding KTB with fresh blood while the Arrows are a strong team. They built up their new team, the Arrows whilst KTB was at a high point. So now, the two teams have effectively switched. The Arrows are just getting better ever season. Let's say the Bullets take 2-3 seasons to train and become strong. At that point KT Rolster should in theory, have TWO very strong teams instead of one, which should be the goal of every org. It's a brilliant plan that I think the CJ org can learn from.

1	Why should somebody not be a nice person just because they have anonymity on their side? It should be a personal reflection on one's character if they are incapable of being a good person just because they don't have to be. If you are at a party where you know nobody, you still wouldn't say certain things, so just because you're not face to face with somebody doesn't mean you should suddenly have the balls to be a total ass just because they can't beat you up.
0	I just don't know...I was born and raised and still living in "the ghetto", and really most of it is not as bad as everyone on here makes it seem. I know there's a lot of i guess privileged people on here, so I guess it seems unfriendly compared to where you come from, but that's just cause the cities don't care about maintaining poor areas. And honestly, well-to-do neighborhoods scare me more. They're like ghost towns. :(
1	I've seen lower elo division in the LCS crop up multiple times over the few years its gotten big and there's a large number of reasons why it will probably never happen. Money is one of the major reasons. Companies will not pump £££'s into a team who are just a group of gold or plat players who have no real chance of reaching the LCS. If we use CLG as a case study here we can basically put it into perspective.   For CLG to hire a lower elo LCS team they would have to spend money and time on multiple different things, the first being scouting. Its far easier to scout pro players because there's far less of them, when there's literally millions of gold and plat players across the world finding decent ones is like picking a needle out of a hay stack. It would take a lot of time and money to find a decent team who work well together.   Secondly sponsorship is a big issue. Quite frankly the difference in viewership between the Challenger league of the LCS and the LCS itself is pretty huge. On a normal week of NA lcs you see an average of 200k viewers on twitch. The second its over and the challenger league is on it drops to about half of that. Baring in mind probably around 50% of that viewer ship is actually there for the games. The other 50% are there to see Phreak do puns and troll in twitch chat (Riot did a smart move putting phreak into Challenger league as a caster). If we use the basis that the reason the viewer ship drops by 50% is because the level of play is lower and the brand names aren't big, then imagine how many viewers a gold or plat division would get. You are looking at 1-2k viewers if you are lucky. 1-2k viewer ship isn't worth a lot in terms of sponsorship, and its certainly not enough to maintain a gaming house and pay your players aswell as coaching staff.
1	I'm sick of posts like this.  Yes, I think that the "League community" is hostile and unforgiving, but ragey posts like this don't solve the problem.  Nobody is looking for proof that you had a game with flamers/ragers.  If you want to be the thousandth person to complain about player toxicity then how about you make a more helpful post.  Offer some possible solutions to the problem instead of just unleashing your inner anger to Reddit.
0	If I don't have the money in my account and for some reason I don't realize it, you're goddamn right it will be cancelled. I turned off overdraft protection because I'm on top of my meager finances. I grew up dirt poor, in fact my entire extended family did. I watched adults struggle to keep their checkbooks balanced or too afraid to deal with their banks once overdraft charges were created. People just 5-10 years older than me trying to start families but unable to make a simple budget. So they would spend their money on TVs or things of that sort, then have those fees at the end of the month when the baby needed diapers or milk or whatever the reason. When I started working, I saved every receipt from every transaction and did the math on a whiteboard in my room. Three times a week I would go to the bank's ATM and look at my balance. If there was a discrepancy, I went into the bank and got it figured out. Perhaps twice I had any sort of errors, and they were because I forgot I took money directly from the ATM. Never have had an overdraft fee to this day. Banks don't do favors for anyone but themselves and their investors. Don't kid yourself.
0	So I could read it all day, but I wouldn't know what any of it meant.   That's a terrible excuse for not trying to learn on your own.  Its perfectly acceptable to try to understand something on your own and then turning to others if you have trouble.  Going to other people before even trying is an incredibly inefficient way to learn because you won't know if you're asking the right question.   For example, if you tried asking your professor about velocity without ever having heard the word "velocity" before then you're much less likely to understand their answer than if you had at least a vague sense of what you were looking for.   To put this in context with how this discussion started consider your questioning of the authenticity of Dorner's manuscript.  Your question seemed to include the assumption that his manuscript was found.  If you had done some research you would know why the authenticity isn't much of a concern in the discussion.   There are a lot of questions around the life and death of Dorner, but by questioning something that's been discussed extensively on reddit your question was ignored because other people assumed you were inserting yourself into a discussion you knew nothing about.  Now its probably unfair for people to react that way, but ultimately you can't change how people react to your questions as you can only control the quality of questions.
1	Thank you.
1	No its not   Edit :
1	Note that Corki did get released first. But the idea for a hero was recommended on the dota forums from a random guy well before LoL or DotA made their respective heroes. Technically both LoL and DotA just took a hero idea someone posted on the playdota forums and then fit it into their respective game.   This whole Corki vs Gyro argument is so old.
1	I think this change will be paired with nerfs not solely because of the obvious fact that this will be a huge buff to Riven, but because I believe the balancing team approved this change in order to better tweak her.   Let's look at the current state of Riven: the vast majority of people cannot auto attack cancel as well as Faker or high ladder Riven mains. Because of this fact, Riven is balanced in the sense that most people simply can't play her as well, thus unable to exploit her incredible burst unlike the top 1% of players.   This means it is hard for the balancing team to change numbers or skills without damaging the experience for other players. Let's say the balancing team says "hey, riven is really strong when Faker or BoxBox uses her so lets nerf her q damage." This may be a fair nerf for them but remember how most people can't auto attack cancel as well as those two players? The overall effect would mean almost all Rivens would be forced to do less damage or at least have less immediate burst (leading to other scenarios [people getting away, failing to win trades, and such]), an unwarranted nerf (assuming Riven isn't broken right now).   Now if the balancing team has looked at it that way, it could make sense for them to implement this current PBE Riven. By removing the need for animation canceling, Riven will always be outputting maximum damage, allowing the balancing team to change her numbers in a way that affects players more "equally" in the sense that it has gotten so much easier to use her q that everyone can take advantage of her passive in the same time frame so tweaking her damage would have a relatively equal impact on all players.   Now I'm not saying I approve of this change, but I am saying it may not be as bad as it may seem and that the balancing team may have thought this through (hopefully!). I'm against it because I feel it undermines the importance of mechanics. I feel its fair for Riven to be a champion that is "balanced" in terms of win rate (at the time of this post she is 50%) but can show her true potential in the hands of a skilled player (of course, if her true potential is so overwhelmingly powerful that it becomes oppressive, it's understandable to nerf it). However, I do not believe that is the case for Riven. Perhaps that's just me being ignorant of how powerful Riven mains really are, but I don't think she's broken at the moment and I'd rather keep her as she is.   Thanks for reading, just my two cents on what's going on.
0	I remember taking my SAT and overhearing this girl tell her friends that she had forgotten her test.  Since the test was being administered at her own public school, she lived within the district and definitely could have had her mom/dad drive back with it; there was just enough time before we started.  Anyway, a few weeks later I was retaking the SAT and there she was again, but now she had her calculator.  It pisses me off to no end that she had wasted her own as well as her parents' time and money, regardless of whether or not her score improved.  Needless to say, some ppl just don't care enough.
0	Well, she was drunk and flipped shit because I lost her drink in a bar (she had enough anyway), I bought her a new one. It wasn't the drink she wanted, so I stood up to by her the right drink. In the process of standing up I accidentally spilled half of the drink on her dress - she retaliated by pouring the whole thing into my face.   That was the breaking point, I got to me feet and told her to fuck off, I am going home and I will not take any more shit from her. I left the club and she followed me, asking if I am breaking up (like there was any question about that oO) and grabbed me. After a short brawl (where I frequently warned her: "[Exname], I have to brake your grip if you won't let go!" and she complained afterwards that  I  hit her, although any aggression was on  her  behalf) I walked home alone, feeling miserable and pissed. At that point I thought everything was over but well... it just started. She showed up at my house, asking for her love-letters, she wanted them back. "Well, fuck you, here are your letters no gtfo."... a few minutes later she was knocking on my window so I half-opened it and asked what her goddamn problem is. Her response was: "Do you want to see how I burn them?" and I was like "wtf I do not care what you do." I went back to bed.   A few minutes later I saw the shine of fire right outside my window, I mean, like directly infront of my window. I could not accept this, the flames were high and threatened my blinds, so I got a fire-extinguisher, opened the window and extinguished the fire. At that point she was making a run for my window, clawing at me, so I pointed the nozzle at her and well... that was kind of fun. Really. I always wanted to douse somebody with a fire extinguisher, so there was my chance and I did not let that one pass.   The rest is history. We broke up, tried to stay friends despite the events, did not work out (because she is a stupid bitch), I deleted her and feel great now.
1	From what I remember the main reason League of Legends was made was for people to have fun... instead of worrying about how much ELO you have and how much time you're wasting just play the game and learn to have fun. Be it win or lose.
0	Not all shooters are mentally ill, some are just angry. Not only that, it is very difficult to identify people experiencing mental illness as the symptoms are often hidden.   The only point of guns is to kill - they serve no other purpose. Make guns much harder to access and you will take away one of the only weapons that the average human has absolutely no defence from. Knives at least require the attacker to be much closer to the target, at which point the target has the opportunity to defend themselves from the attacker instead of being a sitting duck.
1	Carry.   On other note, people doesnt appreciate what supports does, strong cvs and wards win games.  Also... people doesnt appreciate what jungler does, strong counter junglings win games.   All you will heard is : SORAKA HEAL ME GIEB ME MANA HURR NOOB SORAKA 0-2 WHATS THAT NEGATIVE SCORE LOL?   TRUNDLE WTF IS THIS SHIT, Y U NO GANKING, IM PUSHING HIM TO TOWER AND TOWERS KILL ME U JUST DONT COME TO KILL THIS NOOB THAT CANT FARM WITH MY OVEREXTENDING CAUSE IM GOOD!!!!1!!
1	The thing is, for pro players the meta is a reliable way to find out which champion you should play. This is because pro players are the best players in the world, and they know so much about the game and can constantly figure out which champions are stronger than others. The thing is, the meta isn't a group of champions that are insanely much stronger than other champions, they are champions who are just a bit better than others, and pro players can exploit these champions. But low elo players usually don't know why a champion is strong, and don't know how to play the champions to the fullest, which makes all the champions pretty equal.
1	I too come from sc2 master player background. Also i am new to lol (just hit 30 started playing ranked at the start of season 3). You only get good with champs if you play them over and over.  Comparing playing different champions in LoL to all ing in Sc2 is dumb. All ing take less skill to pull off than macro play in sc2 while in LoL if all you do is play one role and one champion you become an expert in that champ. That makes you good. You being able to play every position equally good doesn't make you better than the person who plays one role extremely well. It just makes you more flexible and a team player in champ select.   Look at Destiny he was stuck around 1500 elo for the longest time when he started playing Draven. Now he is like 1800 elo now. He plays Draven adc 95% of games. He mastered Draven and because of that he rose in elo. because playing one champ does increase your skill in LoL. Every game you play you mistakes no matter how good you are with a champ. If you learn from these mistakes you will also be increasing your skill level in LoL.
1	This might be a little off topic, but I've reflected a lot on the people that I've truly come to respect. I could give specific examples, but I think this post is gonna already be long winded enough. However,  through examining those people that I truly respect, I've come to some conclusions that have helped me through rough times, motivating me to turn my life around, and come out of a self pitying depression.   There are a lot of people that float through life, never seeming to really have to struggle to reach their goals. They seem to get through life without any crisis, or loss of faith in themselves or their ability. These people are (usually) not the ones that I tend to respect.   When I made a list of the people that I genuinely look up to, I find that it's the people that have really screwed something they love up—the ones that have had real life consequences land on top of them, that have to change themselves and grow in order to bear that weight—that I respect. If you're always right, you never have room to grow. It's only when you mess up that you learn how to cope.   You, MapleStreet, are in such a position. Your situation is rough right now. It is genuinely tough to get through a day when all you perceive is the people who are trying to bring you down. But keep your chin up. Keep pushing, and use it as motivation, if you can. If not, try to ignore it (I say 'try' because I know that it's very difficult).   If you can get through this, you will have something moderately rare, in these comfortable times—you will have developed 'grit'. Sure, everybody is special and perfect in high school, despite their lack of any real achievements. You, on the other hand, will have struggled, and through the trials that you are going through, you will have gained some real self respect.   And you don't have to win the LCS or something ridiculous to have succeeded. Hell, you're already at the pinnacle of the NA circuit. Take some games from the top teams, and take some time to reflect that, even though you were down on yourself, and taking shit from all angles, you persevered.   Here and now, you have the chance to grow. And you really do have a LOT of people that are cheering you on. I am one of the usually silent people that are quietly hoping for your success. If you don't hear a lot from me, it's because you don't need game tips or analysis from a Silver IV player.   But as one guy who has gone through rough times to another guy who is going through rough times, I'm cheering for you. Win or lose, I hope you can continue to keep an attitude that I can cheer for.   Now I'll go back to my little hole, and watch you people who are much better than me at this game do what you do. Hopefully I'll pick something up to improve my god-awful game.
1	I've never posted on reddit before, but I feel so bad that you play support to be a nice guy and are getting screwed over. Bronze is hell. It really is, I just got out of it and promise it is so much better. Silver is a lot more cocky people that think they are good because they are not bronze, but theres less toxicity and more teamwork. Basically, the best advice I can give you is that you are going to have to try to take an important role. I carried myself out of Bronze by playing nidalee top. People raged at me and told me not to and whatever, but at the end of the day, I'm a good player and I play a role that can carry a game. You should do the same thing. Jungle, Top, and mid are all good roles for this. Jungle because its easy to apply pressure on struggling lanes, or help a good player dominate theirs. Top is good because most tops are tanky bruisers, and tanks honestly carry games better than adc. Mid is good because you can help the other lanes and deal mass damage in teamfights if you pick the right one and get good at them. For example: I have really good positioning in team fights and I main Lux mid, because I Have good positioning, I almost never die and I can build her glass cannon, maximizing damage output.
1	The thing about ranked is that you have to FARM FARM FARM. Then FARM some more. Mid/late game is what matters in ranked. Normally (not in elo hell) they aren't feeding early. They're just farming, so they can do better mid/late game.
1	I like to do the other way around on this.  Last night I was 3rd pick expressed my desire to mid, and last pick said "hey do you mind if I mid, I'm best at that role"  So I said Sure, and I played support   Mid is my best role too, but I rather be flexible and help the team morale stay high than be a self righteous jerk and ruin the team's chances of winning before the game even starts.   The mid in question by the way roamed to bot lane a lot, helping us dominate there, chat was full of "Good job" when stuff went well and "Close one/Good try" went stuff went bad.  Raging was low and I believe it helped the team focus on the game.  Don't be stubborn no matter when you pick, and you will find good results.
1	I play Thresh all the time for support (as I saw you do from lolking) and from my perspective he is extremely overpowered and can carry your bot lane and the game. I usually build him extremely tanky as his dps is ridiculous for a support so you need to be alive to do this and you want to be that wall for your adc as well as the initiate if needed. First off start with 3 greens and one pink and 5 health pots (so you can harass and sustain). Win the ward war bot lane do not let your adc die to a gank that is your job as a support. Also initiate hard if you can win (lvl 2 thresh is stupid good). I almost always initiate get really low and flash out to bait first blood for my adc. Once you get ahead you can snowball this lane. If you have ult use it well it can win a 2v2 you were losing. Also make sure you are getting your adc exp before lane. Double golems on blue side on purple side ask jungler to start blue and take wolves. This will help win lane as well. Late game initiate if you can get a good pull then peel for adc. If you are initiated on just peel and use box. You can easily win games by playing this way. As far as items I rush ruby crystal on first back then sightstone and start working on locket right after. Don't buy boots early I dont buy them till mid game. Rely on your initiates for gold from the kills I hardly ever get philo unless building shurelyias (dont get most the time). Let your adc know you are going to be aggressive. Follow these tips and watch your rating soar with Thresh.
1	Lee Sin is a natural jungler and is played there most of the time - hence why people expect you to jungle when you pick him. Kind of like Udyr, who is a strong solo top but is almost exclusively played in the jungle due to his advantages there.   Saying that jungling is "reckless" and "dangerous" is pretty silly. It gives you a big advantage in farming and xp if your enemy doesn't have one, as long as someone can hold a 2v1 lane which isn't actually that hard if they can last hit from under tower. Jungling is a very important role and control of buffs and dragon is not to be underestimated.   Lee is not the easiest champ to jungle either due to his sustain not being as good at early levels but he has very strong ganks. I would try out Udyr for jungling if you haven't done that - he clears the jungle extremely fast, and you can gank easily at lv4 after a full clear + wraiths, not to mention he has great sustain with turtle and stays relevant lategame.   As someone else mentioned, it doesn't hurt to try a few different routes against bots and figure out what paths are working for you. Especially with the new jungle, you have to be opportunistic about ganking. You can't afford to just camp a lane for 2 minutes and wait for them to overextend - if you see an overextended lane, gank it. If you can't gank, keep farming.
1	7800   That's like a 10 year old card. Just my personal opinion but the entertainment value of a computer is huge. The entertainment value of a computer at $1 a day and upgrade my computer every 3 ish years. Try to limit myself to < $1000. Less then $1 a day really...
1	That's very interesting. So rapid nerfs are usually a case of Riot realizing something was broken all along?  When players do something innovative, do they give it some time or say "oh, we should have seen that was OP, let's nerf it fast"?   Also can you shed any light on the Abyssal Scepter nerf? It was never a particularly cost-efficient item -- although it was certainly slot-efficient -- so it seemed to me that it was balanced by the opportunity cost. It is confusing to me for a lot of reasons (which would turn this into
1	Thats hundreds of dollars some of the bigger streamers/players would be sacrificing by not streaming. Zion who had a big week last week and was named MVP streamed immediately after LCS and got a huge audience turnout, at one point around 8k viewers. The Coke series is getting a big audience, larger than what Riot expected as Nick Allen said earlier in the week -- so viewership isnt struggling.   I dont think it's fair to ask these players to not stream and thus make money. When they have their big moment and get a lot of attention they need capitalize off it for financial reasons AND to continue growing their own player fan base. Yes they do earn a salary from Riot but its not as much as people seem to think it is, their biggest earning potential is from streaming revenues.
1	I would recomend the same thing that has improved my elo by 200.  For one, find your closet op.  For me its rumble, the S3 changes have been extremely favorable for him, and I had already had over 1000 ranked games with him in s2, so I knew what I was doing.  Step two, only play when you feel refreshed, happy, in general your best.
1	Runes and runepages are a terrible idea anyway. I have a  disadvantage  in my game before the game even starts. Why? Because other people  paid  or  have been playing for longer . That's retarded as shit.   Don't get me wrong here, I like the additional thought that goes into what rune setup to use. My problem is that I can't both have a decent champion pool and also have a decent amount of runepages with t3 runes without paying for a ton of RP and playing 2k games.
0	According to [this]( there is no longer any real benefit to manual transmissions, and they are typically only desired by enthusiasts who just don't want to give them up. According to [this]( they also sell poorly, leading most manufacturers to eliminate them from their lineups. If manufacturers make fewer of something, their cost per unit tends to go up. If they know collectors or enthusiasts are the people buying it, they'll jack up the price because they know they'll pay.
0	The problem with porn, and why it hurts women so much (in my female opinion), is when you're that in love with someone it hurts to imagine them seeing another woman naked. Yes, it is essentially fake. (fake as in staged, lights and everything on her is injected with things). Our brains arent always rational though, and it kills us to imagine the worst thing we can, finding them more attractive, fantasizing about being intimate with them. You have to understand generally women come from a place of emotion and not as often raw sexual gratification. We think of the worst. We imagine the worst. Ive always find it's a lot less threatening if the guy will just watch it with her. Generally she can partake in it and make it more of a couple thing, doing it behind her back hurts her, there aren't many women it wont hurt.
0	I was getting really tired of my job as Art Director dealing with idiotic clients and an incompetent management team. I do have a family and it's not easy to quit or relocate. An alternative I found was to find a way to alter my schedule. I told my boss I wanted to invest time in my mental health and try and take a class outside of work as well. I ended up getting a flex schedule where I only need to be in the office half days and worked the rest at home. It's not a fix for the problems but it has def helped me get through my days and stay sane.
0	Full story: I was at a party last night and there was a lot of drinking going on, everyone was talking about terrible movies. Some girl told us about how she found out about "A Serbian Film" and said she wasn't game enough to watch it.   I said it was basically a pile of shit for shock value and had no artistic merit. Some asshole took offense to that because "Everything created has value" and after we angrily argued our points for an hour or so (and most of the women agreed with me after hearing the plot) he ended up getting pissed off, loud and violent. He ended up vomiting everywhere and sleeping on the kitchen floor.
0	There is a natural disconnect between young people who haven't spent years (or decades) earning money and those who have.   This is partly why the idea of "raising taxes on 'the rich'" seems so appealing to young progressives...once they have spent years/decades striving to  join  'the rich' (by possibly earning over $100k a year) and thus provide a better of standard of living for their families, having more of their money taken away becomes much less appealing.
1	Na. People say that Zed and Talon do the same thing, but as far as assassins go they're entirely different.   Zed split pushes like a monster, but his teamfight is like.. W in, blow everything for the ADC and TP back to your shadow. But you get hurt going through AOE to get to the ADC, so, for the rest of the time is you doing W-Q-E combos and TP-ing to that shadow for auto attacks+E at to take out low hp targets.  You also use the slow from E to peel for your ADC.   Talon, on the other hand, uses Ghost Blade E into anyone, pop your ult,  W while stealthed, Q someone squishy, pop Ult again, and blow up people. At this point, the enemy is usually low and/or dead.  But Talon sucks at split pushing.   So Zed>Talon in terms of single assassination  and  split pushing, while Talon>Zed in terms of doing AOE damage :)
1	Not at all.  Assuming you build Philo first and have +5gp10 from rune/mastery, so 23gp10.   HoG cost 825g or 6min, pay for himself in 27m30s (most game are done before it).   Kindle Gem cost 850g, so you can build it 1.1s later than HoG.  Going Kindle>Shurelya cost you 550g, or 4min.  With HoG first (so 28gp10), completing Shurelya cost you 1400g or 8m20.   Going straight to Aegis cost you 1925g or 14min.  With Hog first (6min) you'll need 11m30s to build it, so 17m30 total.   Kindle>Aegis>Shurelya take 24min  HoG>Aegis>Shurelya take 26min   Just check how inefficient is HoG over a ruby crystal now :  350g for 20 health (negligible) and 5gp10.  You'll need 11m40 to make the upgrade worth it, 10min "only" is you count the 20 health (worth ~50g).  It was ~4m30 before the nerf.   Ho, and wards. 75g or 32s without HoG and 27s with. So each ward you buy before completing an item make the HoG path slightly better  by 5s .  So 24 wards (between the time you buy HoG and you complete Shurelya/Aegis) are enough to make the HoG path better (same time to build the items but you'll have the 200 health from the HoG).
0	Several forms of skin cancer are mild, and some other solid tumors are removable, but if it's a different type of cancer, then it's almost impossible to remove completely. If you truly hate this person, you can rest assured they will suffer through a process that won't fully work. The cells that survive will be resistant to whatever treatment was administered, and they will grow exponentially until they reach a certain size. The family will keep on trying new treatments until the resistances are complete, or the more likely outcome, the body can no longer take the stress of chemical bombardment. Even if they do achieve complete remission, and avoid falling through this path, they have significantly added to the balance scales of all the other ways they can hurt and die. Radiation therapy is then an option, and can improve quality of life in a bittersweet way for a young individual who won't get to experience the bell curve of function we call life. In the end, any treatment we receive can only partially lighten the load or shift the scale of death from cancer to heart failure to dementia. The road of chemo and surgery puts a lot of stress on the body and can change a person.
1	So with all if the heal nerfs, that summoner spell is about as effective at dealing with assassins as barrier, which was commonly used in season three by adc's. Exhaust does need a slight nerf, but we are still seeing assassins like Leblanc and fizz (and in high elo's, talon), plus pre-nerfs kha'zix thrive in this supposed anti-assassin meta. Of all of these, the only assassin on the road to nerf town is Leblanc, and her nerfs seemed to be part of an effort to remove anti-retaliation techniques (like silence) from assassins, which makes a lot of sense. After all, it's not really fun to just sit there watching as the enemy 100-0's you, knowing you can't do anything about it.   So why nerf assassins with all of these changes? Well timing is everything here. When ahri, zed, and (I think) fizz were nerfed, exhaust and heal weren't in their current form, and the fact that these champs would constantly wail on the support every chance they got wasn't the only reason they were op. Now I think zed could definitely get some of the nerfs that caused him to feel really clunky reverted, but ahri was still seeing play before the exhaust and heal buffs, and the only reason she didn't see more play back then was for similar reasons to talon in that Leblanc is straight up a stronger pick than her in most ways. I could even see a bit of a return of ahri after some sort of Leblanc nerfs go through.  Overall the state of assassins isn't dire, but not exactly optimal either.
1	Hard to predict to be fair. Let's get started tho.   1st round   TSM 2 - 0 mMe Ferus. I can't see TSM losing to mMe, they're simply a better team. I think if oRb won the tiebreaker, this game would've been really interesting, but still, anything can happen, especially in single elim.   Crs 2 - 0 TSM.Evo. TSM.Evo's been in a big slump recently, while Crs comes from 2 top 3 placements (IPL Face Off and MLG Raleigh). MLG Controversy aside, Crs looked really good at MLG Raleigh, whereas TSM.Evo did not.   CLG.Prime 2 - 0 LgN. I think LgN shocked a lot of people with their 3rd place finish at Face Off, but then again their performance at MLG Raleigh wasn't so great. I think LgN is a good team, but CLG.Prime has more experience and overall better players.   Dig 1 - 2 Dynamic. Probably THE best game of the quarter finals. To think one of these extremely good teams is not going to get past the first round is kinda sad (just like Fnatic vs Crs.EU at the EU regionals). This one's hard to predict given what happened at MLG Raleigh, with Dynamic 2-0'ing Dig, followed by Dig 2-0'ing them back. Overall I think dynamic* has the best shot in this.   2nd round   TSM 2 - 1 Crs. Regardless of their 0-3 loss against TSM at Face Off, Crs has been looking pretty good in recent tourneys (only team to take a game from Blaze at Summer Arena, 2nd at Face Off, "1st" at Raleigh). With that being said, I believe Crs will give TSM some trouble, but not enough, making it a 2-1 win for TSM.   CLG.Prime 2 - 0 Dynamic. The little we've seen from CLG.NA in korea has been disappointing, but they're still a better team than Dynamic overall. At IPL4, when Dynamic surprised everyone by taking a game off Dig, beating aAa and Crs, CLG.Prime beat them without much trouble both games. They've also beat them at GESL. Yes, those tournaments were a while ago, but shows that CLG has been consistently better than Dynamic and I don't believe things will change in this one.   3rd place game   Crs 2 - 1 Dynamic. Another very close set. I believe Crs as a whole is better than Dynamic and that will probably be the deciding factor in this match. Crs actually lost to Dynamic at MLG Anaheim, but since then the team has grown a lot, and I think it's enough for them to beat Dynamic, but it doesn't mean Dynamic won't make them work for their 3rd place finish.   Grand Final   TSM 2 - 1 CLG.Prime   Oh here it is. Probably the greatest rivalry after CLG.EU vs M5 in competitive LoL. CLG.Prime seems to be able to take a set from TSM in each finals, but loses 2-1 in the next one, coming from the lower bracket each time. Their last few games have been interesting, here (going a long time back):     IEM Cologne: CLG 2 - 1 TSM    IPL 3: CLG 2 - 0 TSM (for 3rd place)   IPL 4: CLG 2- 0 TSM; CLG 0 - 2 TSM (2 sets as CLG came from the lower bracket);   GESL: CLG 1 - 2 TSM (semi finals)   MLG Anaheim: CLG 2 - 1 TSM; CLG 1 -2 TSM (2 sets as CLG came from lower bracket).     You can't count CLG out on this one just because they've been losing series vs TSM in tournaments. If you count each win, you get:   10 wins for CLG 8 wins for TSM.   Now, given CLG seems to win the first bo3 every time, that could be an advantage here, as it is single elim, but TSM has been showing really good performances in every tournament recently. This is probably gonna be the closest set out of the whole series. In the end, I have to give it to TSM. Ever since CLG has been in Korea, they've been showing rather poor performance, although a lot is unseen, we'll just have to wait and see.
1	although i may be a rare case, i do get flamed at quite often for being a smurf on my level 16 account because i rage at people for not doing things that are very simple like freezing the lane and farming, although this is my main account. I do enjoy having smurfs in my team, even if they rage, because at least what they are saying holds value and they are actually helping the team win instead of simply complaining that the jungler or players nearby that doesnt save you and blame your death on them when it is your fault in the first place for running across half the map for that kill
1	I posted this somewhere else bit it's relevant so I will copy and paste:   I just hit g5 a few weeks ago, I spent a really long time in silver and this is how I got out. The thing that helped me win the most games was playing aoe champs with a really strong lategame/team fight presence. I am a jungle main, so I played a lot of wukong and amumu. I would spend the majority of my time farming so that I could get the items I needed to be a monster in team fights, and I would only really gank post 6 when my ult was up to guarantee kills. There is this weird phenomenon in sliver, where at around 25/30 mins, both teams group up and just spend the rest of the game pushing mid and forcing team fights regardless of team composition/power distribution or what is going in in different lanes. I highly recommend picking up every dragon whenever you can, but I would be really cautious when trying to force baron. Only do baron when the other team is completely dead/preoccupied, or if your team is behind and baroning is your last hope. The other way I got through silver was becoming really good at support. A lot of people discourage low elo players from getting good at support because support has a "low carry potential", but I think that statement is completely untrue. The reason why being a great support is so important in silver, is because there is a 75% chane that the other teams support was forced into their role and have no idea what they are doing, so you can easily snowball Botlane and single-handedly carry the game with your adc. I recommend playing supports with really good engage, I personally exclusively played Braum and Leona. I love Leona because it is really easy to engage on their ad with your e+q+r combo, unlike champs like thresh or Morgana who you have to land a skills shot with in order to successfully engage. I also really like Braum because he had a really good all in, and he is also great at surviving ganks (I'm used to usually being camped when I support because I play so aggressively). Braum and Leona are also really good in team fights! If you are curious about how I build Braum/Leona I usually go relic shield, targons, sightstone, t1 boots, fotm, t2 boots, locket/fh depending in the other team, randuins, banshees veil, ruby crystal. I usually build randuins before bv because I will likely have mercs and possibly a locket, but sometimes I like to buy mobos on Leona and cdr boots on Braum, so I would then get veil before randuins. Another fun thing to do on tanky supports is to get sunfire cape as your 4th item and split push if nobody else is on you team so you can get huge!
1	Can't understand half his words with that microphone, what is the
1	I once played with an incredibly toxic Ahri player who flamed just about everyone on our team after we gave up first blood. Sadly, she did well that game but we still lost. Next game, I end up playing against her (it was a weird coincidence) and since I was the jungler, I made sure to camp mid until the person eventually tilted and we managed to win by picking them off with my ultimate (I was Rengar that game).
1	Yeah it's pretty ridiculous
0	They also run the test the opposite way. Putting good/old & bad/young together first and then switching them. They come to conclusions by looking at the data altogether, removing the muscle memory bias.
1	Hello,   Optional intro: I'll be honest. I've spent 2 years posting on this sub, but lately I've been feeling like it was becoming an increasingly hostile place. A similar thing happened a while back with GD and I'm hoping that /r/lol will be different. I've tended to be a bit of a contrarian on a few topics but I've always felt like I had a finger on what the general population thought. But this was the last straw. This is exactly the opposite of what I have been saying for years. I thought a while about raging and posting sarcastic comments but instead, I'll try to soldier on and try to engage this topic.   Let's begin this back in beta. One of the biggest complaints about LoL in comparison to other dota clones of that day, was that LoL's champions were extremely simple.   The reasons behind this move was purely marketing and not game design related. Easy to play, hard to master was a mantra repeated by Riot staff and it was extremely successful in garnering a large casual fan base. What players like me took from this was an implicit promise that once LoL got off the ground, that's when they would bring out the real guns. Many players, including myself, tolerated this for a future payout.   This assumption has largely come true (with a few exceptions). The rate at which Riot has been adding new mechanics has been accelerated in the past year or so. Sometimes I feel like they aren't even doing it fast enough or being bold enough with new stuff.   So, what I'm really trying to say is that you guys who want simple champs, you've had your turn already. Simplicity has been Riot's priority since beta. I think the game has had enough time to grow now and its time to shake up the champ creation formula. Look at this list below (with RECENT champs) and tell me that these mechanics are not formulaic re-skinned versions of the same thing:     skillshot damage (optional slow or CC). This is the Q for Rek (burrowed), Kalista, Azir, Gnar, Braum, Vel, Yasuo, Lissandra, Zac, Quinn.    circle AOE damage (optional knockup or slow). This is included in the kits of Rek, Gnar, Vel, Yasuo, Aatrox.    jump or dash into an open area: Rek's tunnel, Azir E, Gnar E, Lucian E.     We seldom get truly unique or complex mechanics like Rek's footstep vision or Gnar's uncontrollable ult or Kalista's auto-step and even these champs are "half-assed" because they feel like they have to include the familiar and fomulaic mechanics described above. Complaints like this just make sure that we'll keep getting more clones. Think about a unique champ like singed. More complaints like this and his Q will be turned into a single target damage skillshot that applies poison.
1	I believe you have answered your own question, no?   Both Broodwar and Warcraft3 have a mechanic that gives an advantage on high ground. Meaning, they reward you for better positioning. How they implemented it is a design choice: it doesn't have to be random. Or if it is random, players should feel justified being hit by it.   My theory of the reason behind RNG is because many games are designed with players VS AIs in mind. Randomness helps bring challenge of overpowered but stupid AIs as they are incapable of making mistake. RNG is what makes bosses in JRPG bosses, even more so in MMORPG.   On crit every X attacks, I meant like Yi or Annie passive. Riot could've make them 20% chance of causing stun (like Ogre Magi in DotA), but they went with another direction, and that more or less reflect their design choices.
1	They have. Many times they have acknowledge our cries for help, it's just a very huge undertaking.   There was a post floating about that stated Riot was basically remapping the internet highways across the US, SPECIFICALLY to aid east coast.   (   Long story short: yes.
0	I agree that overhead should not be the only criteria that one uses to judge a charity's worthiness.  However, alongside some research into the charity it can be a useful figure.  A simple Google search would pull up the World Vision scandal you linked.  That evidence of financial dishonesty should be part of the process to determine if one would donate to that particular charity or not.   I choose not to donate to World Vision.  I made that decision when I researched them and found that they were a Christian charity that used deceptive advertising practices to increase donations.
1	Being able to play a champ is different with mastering a champ. I used to thought I will be able to master a champ in 10-20 games because I think I made really few mistakes; but after playing certain champion for hundreds of time, I started to realize many things I could have done better in many situations with this certain champion.
0	I won't defend it but I do understand it. The only way to fix it would be to take control of taxation away from the local governments - which would never happen because this country is all about local governments having power and preventing the federal government from having too much control. I do tend to agree with the idea that things will go more smoothly if you let states have control over certain things when the country is this large and diverse. I suppose you could argue that taxation shouldn't be one of them because it can be confusing sometimes but I'd guess that many Americans would be really upset if they learned that the federal government planned on telling them what their taxes need to be. I'm fairly certain that sales tax money goes back to the state, not the federal government, so it wouldn't seem fair to force people to charge a certain amount, especially when some states charge nothing currently and make money on other taxes.
0	Painting with broad strokes here...   Protestants tend to use the word disfellowship. Their founding in the Reformation was in protest to the Catholic Church ruling the common folks' lives, where an excommunication was like a scarlet letter. On paper, Protestants don't typically wield that kind of power over their flock. Excommunicated from the Catholic church, you can't go to another Catholic Church. Disfellowshipped from the First Fundamental Bible Baptist Church in Des Moines off the frontage road, and you don't wanna stop being shitty, you can go to the Second Reformed Baptist Church of the Cross a block away by the Tastee freez. (They need new folks anyway.)   My experience with disfellowshipping is that when someone's being unruly or destructive, they aren't shunned but rather left out of the inner circle until they work their shittiness out. But they are welcomed to the church like anyone off the street, and pastors and elders tend to give them extra special attention if they'll have it (like 'let's get coffee'). In one specific instance, a mom/wife was sleeping around on her husband, ruining her family, and still trying to teach Sunday school and stuff. They spent a year appealing to her, per [Matt. 18:15-17]( She continued disregarding appeals to stop that crap, so they brought it before the church without too many specifics and asked if anyone had her ear if they could please appeal to her. After that, they disfellowshipped her.   Not sure if it really plays out differently in the Catholic Church, and I'm sorry for any incorrect statements and anything that was too generalized. I didn't mean to write a novel when I came here to say this. Just wanted to introduce the word 'disfellowship'.
0	This is exactly why I hate Risk. Once you know who will win rolling the dice to see how long it will take for you to lose is torture.   This is also why I like Settlers of Catan. Games generally don't last long enough for any part of it to start to feel like you have no chance. If you are behind, you can still screw with the people who pissed you off. My personal strategy in settlers is that if you mess with me, I might not win, but you certainly won't either. It makes the game a lot more fun even when you aren't the one winning.
0	That happens at the age of 6-7 months and a few months forward, my friend calls it "The Ghostage" because they just stare and bark at nothing.
1	I actually prefer to due lane with Mordekaiser--for quite a few reasons. Yes, he's easy to lane with, but he's also easy to gank, especially in a solo lane. This is because 1) he has no built-in escape mechanisms, and 2) he pretty much HAS to push a lane, which makes him vulnerable to jungle ganks and makes it harder for his own jungler to gank his lane.   If morde is laning 2v1 (as the 1), there are some trade-off. If the enemy does a lot of auto-attacking and lets the minions get pushed to the tower, Morde should be fine (the tower will take some damage, but not much). However, if the two laners top know what they are doing, they will zone Morde out of xp from the very start. If the top laners have 1) a decent a mount of harass, or 2) a decent amount of disable, and they use it before morde is able to reach the minions, laning is going to be difficult for him. If they subsequently keep the minions away from the tower, it will be even more difficult. The jungler will also be somewhat less inclined to gank top (2v2) when they can gank mid (2v1) or bot (3v2).   On top of all, as far as champions that NEED a solo lane go, Mordekaiser is pretty low on the list. Yes, his early-mid game is strong, and is even stronger if he gets to solo lane. But he is can duo lane and still be pretty effective/useful (assuming he doesn't fail really hard). Other champions, such as your ranged dps carries, are much more dependent on having a solo lane than Morde   That said, very little of this is due to the jungler--its the situation of the match as a whole from which these issues arise.
0	The shit you're spewing is vile and dumb and could be corrected with a visit on wikipedia, anyone taking the time to entertain you is naive and way too kind.
0	As a Christian an d(gasp OMG) part time minister (primarily to perform weddings and so forth, but I have done a few guest sermons and led prayer groups) Christian tolerance is TOLERANCE. If they are intolerant at all then it is not tolerance.   Okay full disclosure, I do not believe in the flood, the virgin birth, any of the hoodoo voodoo that is in a misogynistic phobic book written by a bunch of men. I do follow the philosophies of a guy named Jesus. The only words we KNOW he spoke (because it was recorded by friends foes and others for the Romans and Pharisees at the time. Were the Sermon on the Mount (s) (there were actually a few of them), his dieing words on the cross, and a few of his other public sermons. In ALL of them he told people DO NOT JUDGE OTHERS! He was very specific about this. In ALL of them he said be tolerant. In all of them he said love everyone as though they were your brother (or sister). In all of them he said help those in need. In NONE of them did he say homosexuality was bad, in NONE of them did he say women were wicked. I follow his philosophies the was a Buddhist follows the philosophies of Buddha. I do not follow the things other people said they heard he said that follows their political agenda of the time. We know the man existed and I like his philosophies.   That said (and I expect some hate on here) Not every pastor feels the way others do. Even if they do not always like someones life choice does not mean they are not tolerant of it. I have many GLBT friends, I have a few GLBT pastor friends. I do not judge how someone else lives, you are as you are made, born, created, whatever. I do believe being gay is NOT a choice, just like I believe being straight is not a choice. Like I said you are what you are. I think to many Christians (and other people) get caught up with who a person has sex with instead of just being happy for them that they are trying to find love. I have been amazed by a so called Christian who said boys will be boys when their son who sleeps around gets a girl pregnant, but condemns a man for being in a long term healthy loving relationship with another man. I just do not get that. I also have witnessed a straight pastor who picked up and carried a bloody victim of assault that this man (and others of us) KNEW had HIV. Carry him to a safe place and work on treating his injuries until the EMTs arrived. This man got covered in his blood (no he never contracted HIV. Thank goodness) had open wounds and never thought about the risk. When asked why he put himself at risk, his response was, "It was the right thing to do." This man 2 weeks later was spit on by 3 gay men for being "homophobic because he asked two of them to not masturbate each other in front of his house (they were outside his house in his front yard. He (and I for that matter) Lived in the Montrose in Houston. This was the weekend of the gay pride parade. His son and his grand children lived with him at the time. He did not want his grand children to see ANYONE having sex in his front yard on his property, but these 3 men spit on him and cussed him out and called him homophobic for that.   Stupidity and intolerance goes all ways. Being a Christian does not mean hating or even disliking GLBT people. Just like being white does not mean hating blacks. Yet you have people on all sides being over sensitive and looking for a reason to call someone out.   Yes you and many others have suffered at the hands of people, many of whom used a presumed faith as an excuse for their hatred and fear. That does not mean that it is the faiths fault. I am deeply sorry for the wrongs done to you, to everyone by everyone. Humans have this horrible capacity for cruelty and ignorance. I am very glad this young man in the MEME is safe and found tolerance and hope his family opens their eyes to their wrong doing.   When I was younger and had no faith or belief (since I do not believe i any of the magic of the Bible and am also an engineer and physicist I tend to believe in science, it is merely the philosophy of brotherhood and love that I like and follow) I hung out with the misfits often and this included the GLBT kids and so forth. I came to their defense more than once. When my cousin came out I was in about 2 fights a week defending him. My great aunt was a lesbian in TEXAS from the 30s until the died of cancer in the 90s. She had a 20 year relationship and the only ones in Liberty that knew she was a woman were the local pastor, her doctor, and the feed store owner. Never once did the pastor try to change her or condemn her. Try to learn to judge the individual not the group. Just like you would not want to be grouped in with the type of people that would sit there on some persons lawn in the middle of the day having sex knowing there are children inside (the kids were on the porch when the guys started) try to understand that if you want acceptance, then you must also accept.   anyway, good luck, I wish you the best and hope that your trials and tribulations are mostly over and that you have the best life experiences from now on. Remember when the chips are down and things look bad, there are people out there that care and try to help. The only way we can make this world a better place is through tolerance and by working together.
0	Bikes can come back to you. When I was 16 I saved up for a new Trek- it was stolen a few years later from my back yard, fucker sawed right through the ulock. Saw it at a pawn shop a month later, ran and told a cop who absolutely loathed bike thieves and we drove his squad car, lights and siren on, the 5 blocks back to the pawn shop because "those fuckers might get rid of the evidence". We get there and he bounds into the shop full of righteous fury, leaving me locked in the back seat of his squad car. Comes back 30 seconds later wondering where I am and finally lets me out of the car to point out which bike was mine. Pawn shop is full of lies and claim that the thief must have sneaked the bike into their shop to "make them look bad". Cop told me to take the bike a leave and I got the hell out of there as he screamed at them.   Same bike was lost again, I quit a small touring circus in during a stop in LA; we parted on poor terms and they drove off with my bike still locked to the back of their van. Thought it was lost for good- 3 years later in New Orleans, some friends were about to bike to a party; seeing that I was on foot, one of them offered me his guest bike, which of course was my trek. Same labels, same scratches, a little more rust, but totally my fucking bike. 10 years later and I still have it- it is now locked up with a 5 ft fahgettaboudit chain.
1	It's hard to respond to this post because I think you're just ignorant on so many aspects of the game.  I think you're also looking back at Season 1 with some seriously rose-tinted glasses. Yes the meta has evolved a little bit since Season 1, but I don't see why that's a bad thing.   Oh no, things are different! That must mean it's bad!   Then you go on this strange Dominion rant.  Oh you can troll build in Dominion?  Good for you.  I don't want to see that shit in Summoners Rift because I like competitive matches where people play the most effective builds.  I don't even get why you list Athene's Grail on Orianna, as if you can't build that in Summoner Rift?  I build that all the time on certain champions.
0	my best friend from like 3rd grade until 11th became this person. he was that one friend you had that you would always be with, always staying at each others houses, learning to skateboard, making stupid videos, seriously everything. for christ sake our birthdays are like a week apart. but he branched off with "the cool kids" while i stayed with the "misfits." i wasnt cool for not drinking, and smoking cigs, partying hard, whatever was cool then. so we started to lose touch with each other, especially once we got our driving license. he actually began to hate on me which hurt the worst and just became a huge prick. about a year after we all had graduated, i was with some friends who were also his friends prior, get this call and its him wanting to hangout, it was like 1am, and he comes overs. at first it was great catching up, playing videos games, talking about chicks, anyways, he starts talking about "the cool kids" and how he is fighting with them and there was no one else to hangout with. so in a last ditch effort he called us and we were nice enough to let him come over thinking he finally grew up or something and wanted to actually hang out with us. nope. after that night i never saw him again, we lived in the same town until i moved away when i was 22. it still hurts today knowing i had this great friend who became a giant dick :(
0	Most people think of immigrants as (a) Hispanic and (b) day laborers. This is justifiable by that fact that, while only 3 of the top 10 foreign-born immigrants come from Hispanic countries, Latin America as a whole comprises ~53% of all U.S. immigrants.   My point was that, while immigrant day-laborers  can  and  do  serve a purpose (as farmers, construction workers, hotel cleaning staff, etc.), those immigrants who come here through  legal  means, whether to seek a formal education (international students) or those with professional backgrounds (formal education and business experience) often get overlooked in the immigration debate.
1	He didn't just bring it back up after years of promising he would. When he did, he completely wiped out much of the database / forums containing private developer forums for heroes and items. Many of those champions are in League today (like Teemo.) He refused to acknowledge it even after many old DotA developers gave proof and simply said fuck you to the community again.   That's why people were pissed at him. He had stolen the ideas of many and even though he used them in his final game, he gave no credit to the people who created those ideas (something IceFrog or any other developer with respect to the community would do.)   Basically an example of the outrage from creators I am talking about:   infinitevox  >Oh thanks, THREE YEARS LATER. Oh well, now I can finally prove that I was the creator of: Teemo & Rammus > >And that your Dev team went through the DotA hero/ability/item suggestions and RAPED it for ideas for your game. Thanks so much for that. A little credit would have been nice, but instead you took the forums down so no one would know what you did, and even if they did know, they'd have no proof. > >Sad thing is, you were always nice to me. We'd play games with DevilsUrethra, ReposoEternal, GranDgrant, and a slew of other fun folks. Then you turned feral on us when you decided to make LoL. > >As petty as it may seem, some of us TDA and DotA1 Beta members know everything you actually did and have a long memory. There are a handful of us that know exactly how hard you really did try and screw Ice, and how hard you screwed us TDA/Beta members over. Now that we finally have access to the archives, we have the proof we need. > >Most people think you're a dick now, just wait till we start plastering the screenshots of the old forums where you plundered and pillaged our ideas and hard work for your game, and gave no credit or love back in return.   He took down one of the biggest gaming forums with a HUGE community (maybe more than this subreddit) just so he could have another source of inspiration just by grabbing whatever ideas other people had.
1	I love how LoL actually is full of unspoken rules. Games can go in a very strange direction if you don't adhere to the unspoken rules, like grouping up 2 minutes into the start of the match and taking out towers as a team ARAM style. Team Curse and Dignitas were even punished and disqualified for doing such things during a tournament game, when really no rules were actually broken.
1	I totally disagree with this enormous wall of text. Yeah in late game to defeat the bigger champs you have to stick and spam abilities, right.   I've played after I saw the BEST RENGAR NA stream now 50ish games with Rengar and with his build (do not know his Summoner name now) I can do two things in top lane.   Poke my opponent to pieces, I allow no farm. Getting in the bush, jump, Bola Throw him out of lane time after time. And the best thing is when I hit 6 I go in for the kill just like the lore suggests. How? Poke him down with my E, go into bush (or do the recall trick). Hit R and Q him down and, indeed, a spam of my abilities.   Even better, go invisible when your lane opponent sees it. He will shit his pants because he knows the next 8 seconds you can jump on his ass with devastating force.   You could also push the lane up by spamming abilities. Go roam and help your mid. You have so many options just by your invisibility and the fact you leave the lane scares the shit out of your opponents (knowing you have your ulti).   Even better, turn invis, pick up teleport to bot in bush and jump on their asses.   And the best thing of this is, ganked? No problem, get in bush, jump around on minions get out or just ulti out. His passive and his ulti are so strong. You are able to bring down 3 enemies ganking you just because you can keep jumping around, hit your E (which is a lot of damage especially in early game), go in bush, jump again. You are literally all over the place.   Another nice tip I discovered is placing a pink ward when your enemy has warded the lane in river (or bush for that instance). Do not destroy the ward, you can jump to it from the bush making you even more of a pouncing tiger in fights.   I agree that in late game you will be spamming a lot of your spells, but your main role is just to turn invis and be the assasin. Move through the enemies (or circle around them to avoid any oracles) and kill their APC or ADC, get out and get 3 skills off. Then wait and do it again to get your Q up again.   Rengar is so much fun to play once you discover the invisible aspect of him and his leap (so much different than Evelynn for example which is extremely boring to play imo), you scare the shit out of the carries. And if you get fed it's even more fun just by roaming, seeing one opponent OOP and snap his neck.

1	Some games are just uncarriable, whenever I play solo queue at around 1500 I just play my own game, I dont really care for what the rest of my teammates do and usually it's enough to win the game.
1	I personally think you are underestimating teemo's damage. I'm bored and math is cool so i'll do some as well.     You said Teemos base health at 18 was 1910 but that isn't counting his items or armor   Teemo Defensive Stats   HP: 1910 + (300 from liandry's) = 2210   Armor: 88.05 + (9 from runes) + (50 from armor) = 147.05   Magic Resist: 30 + (12 from runes) = 42     Teemo Offensive Stats   Since we are assuming Vayne is full build with 1 defensive item, I will do the same for Teemo.   Pretty standard Teemo build: Zhonya's, Deathcap, Morellonomicon, Sorc Boots, Void Staff, Liandry's Torment   AD: 44.5 + (3*18) = 98.5   AP: (15 from runes) + (120 from zhonya) + (120 from deathcap) + (80 from morellonomicon) + (70 from void staff) + (50 from liandrys) = 455 * (1.30 for deathcap 30%) = 591.5   Magic Pen: (35% of Vaynes magic resist prior to flat pen [ 92 * .35] ) + (7.8 from runes) + (15 from sorc boots) + (15 from liandry's) = 70   Attack Speed: 1.11 at level 18     Teemos abilities:   Basic Attack: 98.5 AD - 129.5 Armor = 0 Damage   On Hit from toxic shot = 50 + (591.5 * 0.3) = 227.3 - 22 = 205.3   Magic Damage per second from toxic shot = 30 + (591.5 * 0.1) = 89.15 - 22 = 67.15   I'm not sure how to go about accounting for liandry's so I'll just leave it out.   So, a Basic attack will do 205.3 burst damage and then 67.15 damage every second for 4 seconds.   the basic attack can be done 1.11 times every second but the DoT only refreshes it's timer and does not stack.   Blinding Dart:   260 + (591.5 * 0.8) = 733.2 - 22 = 711.2   Cooldown: 8 seconds * .8 (20% cooldown reduction from morellonomicon) = 6.4s   Noxious Trap:   112.5 + (591.5 * 0.2) = 230.8 - 22 = 208.8 every second for 4 seconds.     Vaynes Defensive Stats   HP: 359+(83*18) = 1853   Armor: 9.3 + (3.4*18) + (9 from runes) = 79.5   Magic Resist: 30 + (12 from runes) = 42   Now with GA   Armor: 79.5 + 50 = 129.5   Magic Resist: 42 + 50 = 92   So, Vaynes Stats after Penetration are:   HP:1853   Armor:129.5   Magic Resist: (92 - 70) = 22     Vayne Offensive Stats   (i'm going to use my runes i play adc's with for this which is 7 ad 15% attkspeed   You calculated her AD to be: 235, lets add runes (+7 damage ) = 242AD   and her critical chance to be: 75%   Vaynes level 18 attk speed is 1.132 * (25 zerks + 40 bortk + 15 runes + 50 PD + 40 shiv) = 1.9244     Vayne Abilities   Basic attack:   from your post with changed AD to reflect runes:   > However 3 of 4 shots have crit so we have to multiply 3 of these 4 shots by 2.5 (200% damage from crits plus another 50% from IE) so that means > 242 x 2.5 = 605 > three of the autos are going to do 605 damage and the last is going to do 242 which means > 605 * 3 = 1815 > 1815 + 242 = 2057 damage   so lets divide this by 4 to get the average damage per auto attack.   2057/4 = 514.25   lets also assume that vayne is in final hour for the entire fight since it's 12 seconds long.   514.25+70 = 584.25   Now we also have to take into account the 8% current life damage from botrk. To do this very sketchily I will divide teemos max life in half because thats the average health he'll have between his max health and no health. and then take 8% of that.   2210/2 = 1105 * .08 = 88.4 which gets added straight to physical damage dealt.   584.25+88.4 = 672.65   Tumble is up every 2 seconds. Tumble adds 50% AD to basic attack.   242/2 = 121   Vaynes attack speed is 1.9244. So she will tumble, and be able to auto about 3 times before tumble is back up.   121/3 on an average auto attack = 40.3 damage   now add this to our total again.   672.65+40.3 = 712.95   now subtract teemos armor from this   712.95 - 147.05 = 565.9   Bortk also gives 10% lifesteal which is 565.9 * 0.1 = 56.59 healing per auto attack   Lets add silver bolts real quick.   60 + (8% teemos max life [ 2210 * 0.08 = 176.8 ]) = 236.8 TRUE DAMAGE every 3 auto attacks.   divided by 3 for average damage per auto attack.   236.8/3 = 78.9   adding these two together to get the average damage per auto attack (this is obviously very skewed, hard to account for probabilities in a clean fashion.)   565.9+78.9 = 644.8 damage per auto attack.   for completions sake ill add condemn to this list.   185 + (242/2) = 306 - 147.05 = 158.95 damage assuming he doesn't get hit into a wall.   370 + 242 = 612 - 147.05 = 464.95 damage if he does.   oh yeah and botrk active   10% of teemos max life: 221 - 147.05 = 73.95   this also heals vayne for the unmitigated damage of 221.     CONCLUSION: Fight Calculations   The Start  So like you said Teemo blinding darts and autos vayne once before she goes into stealth. Teemos blinding dart if you look it up actually blinds for 2.5 seconds at max rank.   So Blinding Dart + auto = 711.2 + 205.3 = 916.5 in burst damage putting her at 936.5 HP   at this point vayne cannot attack so she goes into stealth. when she comes out after 1 second she still cannot attack for 1.5 seconds. additionally she took 67.15 more damage from toxic shot while in stealth putting her at 869.35 HP   as you said teemo then auto attacks her as she comes out of stealth dealing another 205.3 burst damage putting her at 664.05   Also as you said she steps on a shroom (because why not) dealing 208.8 damage at the end of the next second which is also when the poison ticks again for 67.15 damage and teemo also is doing another auto attack for another 205.3 damage.   this makes her hp 664.05-208.8-67.15-205.3 = 182.8   blind lasts for 2.5 seconds: we accounted for 1 in stealth, and 1 out of stealth. at this point vaynes cooldown on tumble is up and she can go invisible for another second eliminating any time left on the blind.   So in all reality teemo will send vayne down to 182.8 health before she can even do anything.   When she comes out of stealth, assuming she doesn't get healed by anything she will die to teemos auto attack of 205.3 damage. But let's assume the best and that before this auto attack hit's she is healed.   Teemo HP: 2210   Vayne HP: 182.8   After Blind   Let's assume best case scenario as we did with teemo. As she is coming out of stealth, she hit's teemo with an autoattack of 629.42 damage and heals for 56.59 HP and also immediately botrk's for 73.95 damage and heals for 221 HP and condemn's teemo into a wall dealing 464.95 damage and stunning him for 1.5 seconds. As I said in the previous section teemo should be able to get an auto off just as vayne is also getting her auto off out of stealth and before he is stunned. Also his 2 poisons currently on her tick as she is coming out and doing this quick combination doing 67.15 from toxic shot and 208.8 from Noxious Shroom.   Teemo HP: 2210 - 629.42 - 73.95 - 464.95 = 1041.68   Vayne HP: 182.8 + 56.59 + 221 - 205.3 - 67.15 - 208.8 = -20.86   and shes dead. again.   Now if he doesn't get that auto attack off she sits at a pretty 184.44.   She auto attack speed is 1.9 and teemo is stunned for 1.5 seconds. His blinding dart won't come back up until about 1.5 seconds AFTER he is out of stun so he won't be able to use it again in this fight.   She auto's him twice while stunned and he dies.     IN CONCLUSION (

0	Greeks are known to have anal sex to preserve the virginity of the girl.  As other comments state, starting position isn't specified, in other words, they've been doing the normal doggystyle anal sex, and now her husband is saying they should have more traditional missionary vaginal sex.  Her father, having been clueless to the aforementioned doggystyle anal sex activities hadn't conceived of the idea that they had been doing it doggystyle anal, and basically inadvertently told her to promise to not have sex facing each other.  While doggystyle vaginal sex is conceivable, in both senses of the word, the point of the joke is to imply the doggystyle anal sex.
1	I agree with you on one point: people automatically think he'll be like Ryze because they see mana scaling. However, they fail to realize his mana scaling is fairly poor, and doesn't come close to compensate for his loss of base damage and AP ratios. Let's consider for a sec:     Null sphere got butchered. Over the last couple of patch, Riot has reduced 80 damage at max rank and removed a 2.6 seconds silence completely (which was, by the way, extremely strong important to Kassadin). I know it interrupts channels, but who cares about that anyway? It's not an instant interrupt - it has a cast time and a projectile - and there aren't that many channeling spells to begin with.   Nether blade mana restored is nice, but other than that it's not very good. Passive is insignificant, active has low base damage. You might think it's good because they buffed the AP ratio on it, but that's a mistake, for two reasons, in my opinion. The first is his damage got gutted hard, and building him full AP doesn't seem very appealing. The second is his nether blade used to give bonus damage to auto attacks over a duration, and now it's only one auto attack every 6 seconds. Normally I would say it's better to stack the damage in burst rather than over time on an assassin like Kassadin, but that leads us back to the first reason - he is not really an assassin anymore.   Force Pulse got gutted in damage. Again, 80 less base damage at max rank makes a huge difference, especially in the mid game. At least he got the keep the slow utility.   Riftwalk damage became pretty bad. Actually, it's extremely bad. They removed an 0.8 AP scaling in favor of 2% max mana. Even if you assume you get twice as many Riftwalk casts, the damage is not even close. If you have 4000 mana, you get 80 extra damage from the ratio. If you double that to factor the lower cooldown you get 160. Note that getting 4000 mana is not very easy, and will only be achieved with specific builds late game. On the other hand, with merely 300 AP (which only takes two items), you got 240 extra damage from the scaling. Late game with 600+ AP, you got 480, which is tripple the amount you get now using two rift walks with 4000 mana. (The bonus damage for stacking the ult multiple times helps out a bit, but even factoring that in, you get less than half the damage you used to for more mana).     Overall, I would say Kassadin's damage got gutted so hard, that I don't see any point building him as an AP carry anymore. It would take 40 minutes for him to start doing any significant damage.   Since Kassadin doesn't have damage anymore, there is only one role I can see him filling: being annoying. I think you would probably still have to get at least one major mana item like Seraph's or ROA, or you'll run oom. Other than that, I think Iceborn Gauntlet/Trinity Foce would be pretty good buys on him, and then full tank, with priority on CDR for more jumps, slows and mana restoration from w (important!) during teamfights.   In teamfights, your role is basically to jump in, pop annoying things like AoE slow from E/Randuin's Active/Iceborn Gauntlet, and then use an empowered auto from W. Now if they try to focus you, you can rift walk back out, since it should be on a really short CD with CDR. If they ignore you, you can just keep jumping on their carries and hitting them.   I would like to think that Kassadin is a good splitpusher, because he can escape easily, but in reality I don't see him winning duels against a whole lot of champions in his current state.   Another important thing I just remembered is that he pretty much has no lane to go to. He will lose lane to almost anyone in his current state, so I find it hard to get him out of the laning phase, even if you do pick him for some strange reason.
0	would just like to point out, her logic kinda played out to prove her right. no step father's molested her daughter. now that her daughter is grown too, you probably haven't even thought of it before.
1	If I am not mistaken when Darius leaps into the air his ult is already considered cast, and that is just the animation being completed. I find that different than a Cho or Skarner just being simply out of range when they try to cast.  There have been several situations where somebody has tried to flash away from me but I got my Cho ult off just a hair before their escape so they burned their flash and still died, albeit not as often as with Darius. I still feel the two situations are different
0	Devil's Advocate: It could be a class that's graded on a curve, in which case it  is  a competition, and working on your assignments at home is an unfair advantage.   My high school physics teacher made participation 15% of the final grade; he awarded points to students for things like good quiz scores, "surprising" him with a good question or answer, etc. At the end of the grading period, he would rank students by points and award them participation grades based on their rank. This was also a school where many of the students were the children of literal rocket scientists, who they could go to for help with homework. In other words, us peasant students who tested into the course on our own hard work but couldn't get the teacher to play favorites with us were screwed.
1	As a more serious answer: everyone wants to group at some time during the game. This, however, is mostly when you personally have nothing to do (your lane is pushing/you took your jungle mobs/etc). Odds are though that when you have nothing to do somewhere else on the map and want to group, someone else sees a wave pushing to his tower or knows that jungle camps are going to respawns etc.   So preference order is: doing your own stuff > grouping. So everyone in games goes to do their own stuff, and then wants to group. If this doesn't happen the next step is writing in chat 'jesus, can we group already' quickly followed by '/all gg my team can't group'.   And when your team finally has nothing else to do and moves mid you see that lovely wave pushing into your tower and you go there to take it.   'Well, if they wanted to group, they should've done that earlier'. Right?
0	Saying "My life sucks because I'm black" is just a catch-all, and doesn't necessarily mean anything. It's often meaningless.   Saying "I didn't get the job because I'm black" or "I got attacked because I am black" can be true. It's a legitimate reason for a failing in your life.   It's not an excuse to accept a factual reason. But automatically blaming failings on your race is also bad. Maybe you weren't just qualified for the job - rather than it having anything to do with your race.
1	Now... On the thread title, reksai support, he has sustain(uses fury to heal while burrowed), he has his tremor sense when burrowed for those walking around in bushes, also detects invisible champs (kha, rengar, eve, shaco) when they come to gank. He has true damage which can be beefed up by storing fury. Doesn't really need damage items, he has a knock up, he has chase/initiation potential... He also has long ranged poke (burrowed q)   I can see him being a tank support tbh he has nice kit, no mana worries, take relic shield (naturally) and treat him like Leona
0	I had some luscious long hair. My mom pointed me in the direction of her Asian hairstylist. Yes the fact that she's Asian plays a big part. So I went see her and tell her I want a mullet cut (Johnny Craig is my man crush and he has a rockin mullet, look him up if you don't know). She repeats it back "yu wan e muleet rie." I'm like, "you know it, bringin back the 80s." She then proceeds to take clippers with the smallest guard possible, and starts shaving the party portion of my hair. I'm thinking in my head, "okay, this is a weird mullet cut, but hey, she's the stylist." To cut down on time, she cut my hair to some non-mullet fohawk douchey looking shit. "So yu lie yu muleet?". "Yea, it looks good, here's a 20."

0	Ugh. My ex fiance proposed with a replica of the One Ring from LOTR. He thought it was sweet/amazing, but the ring was bulky, a size too big, couldn't be resized, and I'm not all that into LOTR like he was, though I do have a passing interest. Plus, there were a myriad of other rings in the LOTR verse that would have made more sense. He only did it with the One Ring because he wanted to have this great story to tell.   I loved him, so it wasn't that big of a deal for me, but looking back, he was an asshole who really only did it to boost his own over inflated ego.
0	Let's not mince words here: I don't think there's anything wrong with having a period, I would most definitely not make the situation for the girl even more awkward and I certainly would not ridicule her for it. It is a normal function of her body that she can help no more than that boys get hard ons they can't control.   I can tell you, from my personal experience, that when such conversation was initiated by a girl of that age, I kindly but firmly directed her towards her mother for more information. I didn't even want to be a part of the conversation where she later discusses with her parents "Oh, we had a great time, and he gave me some great information on girls having periods." There simply is nothing about that which will sound good to those parents.
0	Clinical psych grad student here.  Over sleeping (hypersomnia) and undersleeping (insomnia) are both symptoms of depression (we're weird like that).  For you and OP and everyone else who reads this: we all have our best set hours of sleep that let us wake up refreshed and ready to take on the day.  if you notice that you're not getting that kind of sleep or quite that kind of waking energy, change up your sleep cycle and shoot for 6-9 hours (my golden zone is around 7-8).  If you notice you're getting depressed or even retreating into sleep to avoid waking depression (happened to me, too), spend some of those waking hours at a professional's office.  A therapist to help you out or even a psychiatrist to help you stabilize things so you can effectively work with a therapist.  Working out also helps, gym buddies and scheduled classes can help with that.
1	I don't think its a conscious effort on their part to get people to buy champions.  They only do this with OP release champs like yasuo, jinx, etc.  With old champs though I think they are just genuinely having a really difficult time trying to balance the game.  I've played countless competitive online video games throughout my life, and in every one I can think of- some aspects are OP, some UP.   I also think there was a red post somewhere explaining why they are having a particularly hard time balancing top lane.  I forget what it said, but I remembering thinking "Ahh, that makes sense"
1	I was having a bad game and I was really tired. I was Nunu and fed top and their jungler. Im getting insulted.   Teammate: you suck.   Me: yeah, youve got something I can suck.
1	Here's my take on Sion - I put it in that thread as well. I'd love some feedback!   I've always felt like the execution of Sion's lore is where he falls most flat. The human battering ram is more like the human minigun - he's incredibly slow and pointless at all times until you begin firing off with his ult, then he can mow down absolutely anyone in a matter of seconds with no danger. Battering rams have a very long wind up time, with a satisfying, incredibly strong, single strike as a payoff. The revived, feels-no-pain battering ram should have a similar feeling to that, as opposed to the light-strikes speed based attacker we have now.   As such, I think Sion should remain AD, and any AP ratios mixed into his kit should be a result of the magic that reanimated him, not anything that he is actively doing himself. He should fit the undead battering ram theme much more closely, with powerful blows that take a while to fire off. He should also have moves that actively put him in danger to reflect his reckless nature. These are the ideas I came up with:     His stun needs to stay, but does not need to be magic based. I believe it should reflect the way a battering ram can slam through hard objects and should have him gradually increasing his speed in a straight line, charging toward the opponent. The first opponent he impacts should be carried with him to the end point of the charge and stunned for the duration of the move. Either that or the first person impacted is blown backward. The amount of distance travelled in either case would depend on how much speed he had built up by the time he impacted. This move's damage would scale with AD.     His shield is problematic, as while it allows him to charge front lines as he would thematically, it does so by disregarding his reckless nature. I believe it should be based off of his health, and should also be based around his love of battle. Something that scales with the number of nearby enemy champions would make this a viable move in-lane, but not overpowered, while scaling very well into teamfights in the late game. Since it scales off of %health in strength, it can also have an AP ratio that deals a type of burn damage as long as the shield is up, although that idea is not fully formed yet.     His health scaling + extra damage + self-damage, are currently the most interesting part of his kit to me. The self-damage in order to deal extra damage are currently the most thematically representative part of his kit. Keeping this similar to what it already is would be best, but in order to preserve his hybrid nature, make the extra damage he deals scale with AP and deal magic damage on hit. The explanation for this can be that his bloodlust became personified with the magic used to revive him, and now whenever he feels particularly strong bloodlust, he actually feeds off the health of the enemies he slays. Keep the health scaling essentially what it is.     His ult needs to be scrapped entirely, except for the auto-attack enhancing portion. It makes no sense. Battering rams do not 'swish', nor do they attack incredibly fast. They do not heal in an AOE, they create devastating impacts and destroy things in their area. As such, his ult needs to focus on making those devastating impacts feel truly terrifying. The concept I have reduces his attack speed by a set percentage, but increases the damage dealt by each blow dramatically. Each blow also slows the person being hit, and deals AOE damage around the center of the blow. People near the center who aren't the target are pushed away each blow.       His passive should incorporate a type of tenacity. I'm not completely sure how that would be balanced, but his presence needs to constantly be looming and threatening. Even though he is slow, he's constantly moving toward you and is always a threat.   I realize my conception of his stun is similar to Hecarim's Devastating Charge in the second instance, although the distance the person would be blown back is much greater and is meant to be used more as a position changer than an engage. My conception of him hopefully preserves both AD and AP play, and also allows counterplay. It also allows for him to scale well with movement speed and attack speed, while still being stopped by hard CC, as his stun move is not a dash, but is instead a movement speed modifier. This way, if you can stop him from getting into position to deliver his devastating blows, then he will be much less dangerous, but still a force to be reckoned with, and never something that can be completely ignored. If he doesn't get time to draw back and power up like a real battering ram, he'll be a kitty cat.   As far as aesthetics go - he needs to be a hulk. He needs to be absolutely massive for a human, as I highly doubt Noxus of all places would have revived him without adding a few augments of their own. I like the green coloration, although it needs to be updated, and I believe his axe should be blunt, perhaps made of stone. The sharp edge of the Chopper can come from magic, as specified in his kit above. Perhaps lop off one of his hands and replace it with the axe? Either it's a manifestation of his bloodlust or Noxus added it themselves. Everything about him should personify "heavy" - even champs such as Gragas feel relatively light when moving around. Sion needs to stomp, charge, and attack with heavy-handed, extreme, ungraceful power. Whatever move he uses that drains health from him needs to cause some sort of bleeding effect to happen on his model.   If his lore is to stay the same, he needs a scar on his neck, specifically, since he was beheaded. Perhaps his new joke or taunt could have something to do with him juggling his head around. Emphasize his undead nature by showing the wear and tear on him - I'm a fan of him being armorless, but with multiple weapons sticking out of his back. When he dies, he falls with a thud and his head rolls away.   I recognize that there are some weaknesses in this conception of him, and I would like feedback!
1	Shaco stabbed a reporter.   He skins his enemies   His poison is a poison that attacks the nerve system. He also makes people hallucinate, can dissapear from the world (he can travel through dimensions), he has boxes that shoot out energy, and he supposedly has MORE killing devices. He is uncatchable in the lore, and kills for fun. People are not even sure if he's a mercenary because he kills for fun.   You might think he's useless because of his build and weapons, but in reality, you can never think highly of Shaco, because the moment you would, the moment you are defeated, your throat is already slit and your eyeballs already out of their holes.
1	It doesn't matter how balanced the game is, at the most competitive level people are always going to pick whatever is the very best, even if the difference between a tier 1 and tier 2 pick is minuscule. Balancing a game to have a large number of competitive picks is pretty much impossible unless you make all the champions virtually identical.
0	Chinese medicine in the west may be portrayed as a bunch of crackpots, but people in the east take it very seriously.  To them it's just as valid as western medicine.  Most of my students are much more likely to take TCM than they are western medicine, and are just as healthy as people back home.  After living here for so long, I can't help but wonder if there isn't something to it.   How many hundreds of years has TCM been used?  It's something that is thoroughly ingrained in the culture here.  Cultures don't usually keep something around that doesn't serve some sort of cultural purpose.   A lot of remedies used in Chinese Medicine comes from centuries of trial and error.  True Chinese doctors here got to school and apprentice for nearly as many years as western doctors to learn their trade.  Certainly some of it is useless, but not all of it.  There's no need to attack TCM ad hominem.  There is something to it.  For example, when you're suffering from aches and pain, you'll get several packets of some strange brown powder that you're supposed to take several times a day.  It contains a bunch of different things that probably do nothing, but one of the ingredients is willow bark.  What can be made from willow bark?  Aspirin.  Cultures all over the world have been chewing willow bark for millennia.  Somewhere, a long way back, Chinese doctors learned willow bark eased pain.  Western medicine was several thousand years in catching up.   If they were correct in one thing, isn't it conceivable that they could be correct in others?
1	I feel like even LMQ is weak compared to the Koreans and their level of map control, rotations, and teamfight ability/shotcalling. Only C9 knows how to do all of those consistently; DIG was on top earlier in the split but they haven't been consistent, and the same goes for CLG. I really want NA to be competitive but it seems like these teams have clear weaknesses, which they shouldn't if they want to beat the Koreans or even the Chinese at one point.

1	You don't need armor or MR, or CC reduction when you're an assassin." This, of course, depends on the enemy team comp. You will die to any Amumu with a room temperature IQ if this is an inflexible mindset.   If you're talking about laning survivability, I can't think of a single champion who would build Rylai's before WotA.   As an assassin, CC is your worst nightmare. If LeBlanc gets snared, she dies. The hard counter to Kassadin, besides physical damage, is long duration stuns and suppresses. How do you stop a Katarina ult, if not with a stun? That's why QSS is so popular among carries and assassins; they are the ones focused first in teamfights.   You can burst hard, but if they live through your combo in a teamfight with a BV and a support healing them, a sustain damage mage or carry's dps will rapidly exceed yours after a few seconds.   "If an engagement goes sour she can just dash away..." The extra 630 HP from RoA is about a half second of extra life in a lvl 18 teamfight. Most level 18 stuns and snares last for around two seconds. Math.   "Triple dorans ring is hardly a staller; If you look at similarly categorized burst mages, like Leblanc, they get several Dorans rings and roam to rack up lots of kills to feed Deathcap." Triple Doran's is EXACTLY a build staller, because she is STALLING her late game build in favor of quick and cheap power. But she has to do this, because she is LeBlanc, and there is no late game for her. With triple Doran's, you get a great surge of strength at the cost of 700g. There is a chance you will make up that 700g in kills, but if not, you come out behind in lategame.   Also, unless you're queueing at low elo, don't rely on roaming for gold--This is why Twitch, LeBlanc and Evelynn, characters somewhat based around roaming, have some of the lowest W/L ratios in League. A smart team is controlling their lanes and warding while you lose cs and your tower.
1	Well this is my theory, with all the knowledge and speculations we have so far. Vel'Koz is related to the Watchers, and Lissandra somehow. He is most likely a Watcher himself (Big eye, seen all over howling abyss, "Watcher"... how can you not name a guy with a big eye a watcher) The Frostguard Icon, also heavily looks like Vel'Koz. But he is also related to Xerath! If you look [here] ( several of these videos involve the Xerath rework, so what does this mean? People think that Xerath made a deal with the Watchers so that he can be freed from his chains. But how did Xerath come in contact with them? There was a reddit forum about this but I can't seem to find it. Also, if you look [here] ( the person is previewing Xerath's reworked skills, starting from Q-W but then he skips E and goes to his ultimate and that's when the Vel'Koz teaser appears... He then shows the ultimate and shows Xerath's E last. People have said that Xerath's E somehow looks like Vel'Koz's eye.            And about the numerous watchers thing, how DID Vel'Koz get through the gates? Why did he join the League of Legends? If you go onto the league of legends wiki of Howling Abyss, this is the story of the bridge, from Greyor the spirit who was bound to the bridge by Avarosa.   "Everybody's forgotten who built this bridge and why. Everybody's forgotten the war that gave this place it's scars. Everyone, but me. I was there! I saw the battle! I died here, and I never left this place! I was bound here to stand guard and sound my  war horn when our enemies come back. And now, now the howling grows louder, and I sense something evil stirring in the abyss, my hand reaches for my war horn. This place will soon see a battle again. One that will shape the Freljord for all time. And if the Freljord falls, so too will the rest of the world. Yes, this is more than just a bridge."   "now the howling grows louder, and I sense something evil stirring in the abyss, my hand reaches for my war horn". The Howling Abyss buzz was roughly 9 months ago... is this "soon" enough? But why would Vel'Koz join the league if him and his fellow Watchers got out? Wouldn't they want to regain control? The only answer to this could be that Vel'Koz was the  only  one who got out. How did he get out? We have the man of Chains Xerath, who's deal with Vel'Koz might've been "free me from my chains, and I'll help free your kind", but only released Vel'Koz from the gates, maybe because he didn't fully trust them? Perhaps Vel'Koz ran off from Xerath, and joined the League so they would free his kind? But how did Xerath free them? Maybe he worked together with Lissandra?             We must also keep in mind that Vel'Koz is from the void, which probably means the Watchers are all from the void too. This also means that all of Freljord have been exposed to it, (or at least Avarosa's generation) and that also means Lissandra's powers came from them. But if they were all from the void, how did they have ice powers? Lissandra's lore states   "Centuries ago, Lissandra betrayed her tribe to evil creatures, known as the Frozen Watchers, in return for power. That was the last day that warm blood ran through her veins."   Are Vel'Koz and the Watchers much more than just Void creatures? How did they give Lissandra ice powers? Why were they called Frozen Watchers, if Vel'Koz doesn't look anything near Frozen now?
0	Do you think so?   I think I'd respect someone who was open about their mistakes a little more than someone I'm ambiguous about, especially when the criminal courts burden of proof is "beyond reasonable doubt".   Mistrials do happen, innocent people end up in jail, but I'll probably always think if they're in prison, they're most likely guilty, and therefore if claiming innocence, they're most likely lying. From that, if they haven't been rehabilitated past that point, I wouldn't really want them let out.
1	I really hate how players want everything to be available. It takes you literally a half second to check what damage your smite deals. You've more than enough time to do that while running to drake anyway. Also it's something that people know. It's a great addition, but I dont think it's that huge of a thing.
1	Everyone has their own personal elo hell.  Lesson learned from that dip. -You will get afk, feeders, etc, don't let that get to you, you'll get angry, pissed off, re-que, same thing will happen again, and then it spirals out of control, before you know it you've reached a new level of hell.  Fortunately you can only go down so far, and you can get out easy enough if you're indeed better than where you're suppose to be at, hence the win streak after that.   So now, if I get 3 losses in a row, I call it for the night (in ranked that is) and take a break from it.  There are just some days where I'd suck pretty bad and playing anymore would be worse or there was a flood of trolls out that night, best stay away! :)  Atleast that's what I reasoned from it.
0	The dynamics of urban life have quite complicated the situation indeed sir! Also, put enough money into the formula on either side and you may see a very slippery slope indeed! I personally am an uneducated 30ish semi-professional with 8 years in a state job. I'm constantly broke and own very few valuable things. I somehow landed a beautiful alpha female that's early 20ish with a degree, favorable job and happens to be independently wealthy through inheritance. Hell, I don't know how this happened! I however feel a good deal more valuable then I was at 20. Sorry so long.
1	Pretty much completely ruining any competitive viability of this champion. As she's my favorite champion, this makes me incredibly sad. I've always felt Elise was a Lee Sin who was better at certain things but traded them off for some other with Lee being undeniably the better champion (I believe LS is by far the most OP champion in the game, but that's another story for another time).   Lee's early game is 100x more ridiculous than Elise's. With 0 emphasis on positioning due to his sub-15 second CD reposition, all Lee has to do is land 1 skill shot and he instantly applies execute damage right after. Accidentally jumped under tower? God thing the tool you used to engage isn't your disengage right (Rappel).   The things Elise's do and high skill cap (ex: rappel onto the back line of minions, instantly shift out and full combo). Are powerful, sure, but they're risky. If you rappel offensively you have no rappel if you, say, get knocked back into the tower you rappelled close to.   Also I think the point OP brought up with the drop off rate of Elise as the game goes on is highly relevant. She brings NOTHING to a teamfight, a little bit of execute damage because you have to go full tank. This is literally not comparable to Lee who's almost unkillable due to mobility, has a ludicrously short CD displacement, shield, execute on a similar CD to Elise's.
0	As someone who just sat through an ultrasound with my wife and being excited because this baby (#4) looks less affected by a genetic syndrome than 2 of his 3 brothers are, allow me to say, with all due respect OP, fuck you. Yes, I'm religious, yes it affects my opinion. However, I know, that parenting these boys, with all their struggles, all their challenges, has made me a better man, a better husband.  Had we not had our oldest son, my wife and I would likely have divorced, but we learned to work through things, to be there, together, for our child...
1	I'm confused... If he's 23-1 with Rammus why is he still bronze? And is it possible that he could teach me to play Rammus better?
0	Sorry for mostly talking about business/poweruser use. It is indeed, what I most run into.   The Metro interface is indeed fine on phone and tablet. And I would be happy if they had kept it there, or, (and this is crucial!)  made it optional! .   If there would have been a setting in the properties somewhere that you could use a "Windows 7 style" start menu instead of the metro screen, then I would have frowned at the odd design choice, but that would have been fine. In fact, in that case, I probably would have used Windows 8(.1) on my main pc.   The problem is that it's forced on you as a user. You are forced into the tablet mindset/UI as a desktop/laptop user with the blatant motive that it will acclimatize you for Windows tablet/phone purchases.   Following this mindset, I don't want the Metro apps to be completely purged from  all  Windows 8 (or 10), but I want to be able to setup my own computer, or the office computers of clients, in such a way that for me/us, they won't appear unless we really want them to.   To briefly clarify the accounts thing: the useful accounts (e.g. Skydrive) is fully available to me on Windows 7. The only really new thing that Windows 8 brings is the syncing of Metro apps and the occasional password sync.   Besides, most of the features you're describing (syncing desktop, app settings, password) are already available in all (even the tiniest) windows servers (i.e. office environments) anyway. Even back when we were running Windows NT4 (the business sibling of Windows 95/98).
1	I agree with most of what you have to say, except conforming to some sort of schedule that this problem seems to have. Sure I could call Comcast 4 times a day instead of 3, sure it may be out of riot's hands and into Comcast's, but what about everyone else? All those other ISPs that have the same problem with Riot don't have any responsibility either? Something is going on and if the only issue these ISPs are having are with Riot, would it not be their responsibility to investigate? (Riot)
1	You believe whatever you want. He was a player strong enough to be recognized by one of the biggest organizations in Korean LoL eSports, and he would have been the top laner for one of their teams had they decided not to renew his contract since his replacement (Save) is considered by many over their to be one of the best, if not THE best, top laner in the region right now.
0	It was more a joke than thick sarcasm.   But, I wouldn't provide a link if I was just being an asshole.   I'm genuinelt trying to answer you and curious your opinion on my answer.
1	Observation bias in action.   You say you provided correct information because you know you said it and you favour yourself/trust you over him and the admins. The admins don't know the difference between you two, so they evaluated both statements on their relative merits. If all you said was: "I turned up at 6 and he was still in a ranked game from earlier, he finished at 6:45 but I decided not to play him anyway." Then I can understand an admin deciding against you when they were also told that "He already added you", and that he claims to have been trying to contact you for 3 days.   You are being very biased towards yourself... from an admins point of view all he has are two players' statements, and inconsistencies in both.   If you said he'd already added you, then that gives weight to the fact he was trying to contact you previously. When you say you logged on at 6pm... you give more weight to the image that you weren't really bothered about the match since you could easily have showed up 2-3 minutes late, after not being online for 3 days from this guy's point of view.   Also the way you decided to just report it as an /ff when he was online and willing to play looks like quite an underhanded move to an admin who is just seeing two statements.
0	Certification is not a requirement to perform CPR. I have held one for 10 years. My EMPLOYER requires that several people per shift be certified, and we are selected to perform it if required to do so, but ANYONE can do it if the person is unresponsive and not breathing.
0	This sounds scarily familiar, shit. I watched all this girl's friends abandon her while she played the victim, acted like it was their fault she couldn't keep any friends, that she was the unfortunate soul in all of this. We were friends for years, even dated for a while, broke up on good terms, stayed close friends. I didn't realize just how badly she treated me.   One summer, she started talking about how much she hated her current boyfriend, how she was annoyed how much he was trying to contact her (they were home from college over the summer and couldn't see each other). She was ignoring his calls and bitching to me the whole time. This guy was the closest friend she'd had since me, he was a total doormat. When school started back up again she was suddenly buddy-buddy with him again because he was the only person who would tolerate her shit. I started to realize all her closest friends had the personality type that rolls over and takes shit without fighting back, and realized that included me. A few months later she was bitching to me about all her new college friends not agreeing with her on the tiniest things and talking about how they'd started to abandon her.   Ending that was the most liberating thing. I'd tried really hard to avoid it, to get her to understand, but  an emotional manipulator will always be one.  There's a fucking reason no one else would stay friends with her.

0	Listen I'm all for child support under the right circumstances. And I believe the person receiving the child support should have to keep all records/receipts of what the money was spent on to insure the money was actually going towards the children and only the children and set up an agency or separate branch of the child support divisions that handles this. Not only would it stop child support scams but it would also create more jobs (kill two birds with one stone?).   But I'm torn with the spousal/alimony situation. I guess it's cause I've never been through a divorce but I am a child of divorce. My parents came to the agreement (no courts) that my father would pay for my school (I went to private school), and basic living needs and my mom paid for my housing (we lived in a condo), clothing, and basic living needs. The agreement would go on until I was 18. Even though my mother didn't have a job when they divorced she never asked for spousal support/alimony.   Of course not all divorces are as nice and smooth as my parents was but I feel that in this day in age you should always be prepared for the worst (I hate to say it but dammit it's true) and shouldn't have to rely on spousal support/alimony.   This goes for both women and men!!!
0	Same here only I didn't have a high IQ. My dad started teaching me math, reading even a little bit of algebra before I started kinder garden. Sure I only really picked up on the math and some of the algebra but all the way to grade 7 I was the kid who wouldn't stop asking questions.   Lots of counselor's told my parents their was something wrong with me. Had a grade 1 teacher that taught us for english who thought I was slow and should be let back.   Some of my teachers hated me cause I was the "brat" but I was lucky and had a few teachers who liked me cause I was so respectful.   Some of my teachers had me as the class tutor because I would finish homework so fast. Some just to get me off their back because I was asking for something to do and some cause the help made their job easier.   Fucking school I was in wouldn't let me skip ahead so come grade 7 I just gave up and called it in. Grade 8 - 12 I never handed in a single piece of homework.   Graduated with straight C-'s across the board. My highest grade was in English 12 because the final was worth 60% of my mark and I got a perfect score on the provincial.
0	Logged in just to comment:   OP, PLEASE DO NOT JUDGE HER SEXUAL ORIENTATION FROM SOME SHIT SHE WROTE IN A FB MESSAGE TO WHOEVER. Talk to your girlfriend. Admit that you saw what you saw. Tell her you're there for her, and that bisexuality is A PERFECTLY ACCEPTABLE ORIENTATION FOR HER IN TERMS OF YOUR RELATIONSHIP but that if she's questioning whether she likes men at all, you'd like to be involved in the conversation.   Also, if you found out she's been seeing a girl, then you're dealing with cheating, and you may act accordingly. Just don't leap to conclusions about her sexuality without USING YOUR WORDS. Human sexuality is a spectrum, not a binary, and maybe she's figuring out she might be attracted to girls but is also totally head over heels in love with you. People can feel both things at once.
1	Don't worry, we still love your
1	Because the golems do have another counterplay than taking wolves. Purple botlane go over to those fuckin golems and fuck the enemy adc and support up while they are tanking the golems. This can turn out in a lot of diffrent ways: Best case scenario is you end up with a kill on either one of the enemies. You get the chance to steal the golems or at least the big one (more exp lol yes ty). You and those 2 golems get a lot of free harrass on the enemies, they will maybe be forced to back if they started dorans, or may chug all their health pots instantly. Or you die a horrible death because their team predicted you coming. But that part is all about which team does the golem dance smartest.  Of course, your team can also go down in tribush, wait for the golems to spawn and try to take double first blood on their botlane. Golems are not unbalanced. It maybe was before the buff they got, because you could kite the golems all day and if the enemies came you probably wouldnt have taken any damage.
1	With that mindset, you won't get far. Saving your teammate means that the opposing team won't get a kill and the game isn't only your 1v1 top, it will eventually lead to the team fights where that mid who got the kill and snowballed because you were selfish can melt you. I remember having teammates with global ults that could have saved me or some of the other teammates but who refused to do so, just because they said that they are saving them for themselves. I simply hated them.

0	Well, many people don't give a damn about gays. This means gay people are free to do what they want, but nobody wants them screaming "It's good to be gay, join the gay community". Unfortunately, some of Russian gay activists do that, as if this was a choice, not genetics.
1	What?   Wukong has tons of time to find a pupil.   It's unknown how much time has passed in runeterra since Yi trained Wukong. He's probably still practicing it even.
0	It all depends on your definition of your 'deity' and 'stupid'.   For some people, 'stupid' means someone who is stupid across all spheres of life. For some people, 'stupid' means momentary stupidity. For some people, 'stupid' means someone who doesn't apply their intelligence in a particular field of life.   People who follow an organized religion and believe in obscure things(deities) with absolute certainty can be classified as 'stupid' under the third definition.Think of unicorns or FSM or tooth-fairy or the myth of Hercules.  Almost everyone would classify a person as 'stupid' under the third definition if the person has absolute belief in any of those things. Absolute belief in 'Yahweh' or 'Shiva' or any interventionist deity who'll save you when in need , is no different. Absolute belief in the literal interpretation of The Testaments or The Koran is no different (gnostic theism is 'stupid').   If your definition of 'deity', however, just pertains to a creator ( as in creator of the universe) and you are not absolutely sure that it is true; that will put you among the rare breed of agnostic theists. There are two kinds of agnostic theists - people who fell over to Pascal's wager and spiritualists. People who fall over to Pascal's wager usually tend to follow one particular organized cult ( one of those popular religions out there) again making the same act of 'stupidity' gnostic theists make. Spiritualists are usually not worshippers, but tend to acknowledge their belief in a creator ( they believe in the possibility of a creator more than that the non-possibility of a creator), but they profess their ignorance on the certainty of the question - there is nothing stupid about that.
0	Still, the use of the word accident without the use of the word negligence does take some blame off of the operator. Yes, I agree it is an accident by the strictest definitions, but these things change in a social context. If someone hits someone else with their car whilst under the influence, you wouldn't call it an accident because it's not harsh enough of a word. You call it manslaughter, and some would even go so far as to call it murder. You don't call the most delicious pie in the world "good", you call it "amazing" or some stronger word. Yes it was good, but that's not doing the pie justice. You don't call the LHC "interesting" because it's the epitome of scientific equipment, and simply saying that it is "interesting" does not do it justice. Hitler wasn't just a "bad guy", he was one of if not the worst human to ever exist. He was so bad that his name has been used as a measure for how bad a person is. He was literally Hitler! Let's imagine that Reddit existed during the post-WWI era and someone posted a picture like this saying "Hitler isn't a bad guy, he's the worst person ever" there wouldn't be this fuss over being a bad guy and the worst person ever being the same thing. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that negligently shooting yourself in the hand is on the same scale as Hitler. What I'm saying is that words carry a certain weight to them. An accident is what happens when a small child unintentionally knocks another child down on the playground. Negligence is when you shoot yourself in the hand unintentionally.
1	Did this in a ranked game once against a Trist solotop. Just farmed minions and didnt think much of dying. Was 0/4/0 midgame, getting raged at, but with a massive creepkill score. Get 1v4 by the enemy team, take down the squishy Tristana, Tristana kill the rest of them. We won on that switch.
1	Hi I'm a D2 player on China's 网通1server (Bilgewater), occasionally play on Ionia, 电信1, and I've play on NA servers whenever I'm back in NA visiting family. I've been playing China league for 2 years and played in NA 1 year prior to that before I moved.   I'm just going to give some background information on Chinese League:   Misc:     Top players play on the Ionia Server, generally players hit top in other servers (like mine) and go prove themselves on Ionia.   There's a lot of servers because there's a lot of god damn people in China   Servers are split into two types, 网通and电信. My chinese isn't good enough to know exactly what these mean exactly (someone else can translate it better) but the basics are that 网通servers are for the Northern part of China (e.g. Beijing) because China has two different types of Internet types that correspond with the servers. 网通 internet is more modern and faster. 电信 is generally based in the southern regions of China (which are more populated)   Patches usually come roughly a month late, though sometimes the gap is only two weeks (less in-game bugs in patches)   Contrary to popular belief, you do not need a Chinese formatted computer to run China LoL, but it does help if you want to run addon programs (LoLbox and Bigfoot)     Chinese LoL Community:     From what I've observed, the community is roughly the same as NA (the mix of normal people, mute people, flamers, trolls, etc.)   HOWEVER, that being said, there's a high percentage of younger children that play LoL in China, 10-14 and a surprising amount are quite high ranking (this leads to me noticing a bit more immaturity at high elos in China)   There is an extremely high amount of elo boosters - It is common for high D1 and Challenger players to have their names changed or have a ranked 5v5 team with their QQ number on it so people can contact them for elo boosting - It's not even hidden    Smurfing occurs quite often and you'll meet many elo boosters when you play but its not an excessively common occurrence     Chinese Ranked Ladder Difficulty:     Bilgewater, my server has in my opinion, moderate difficulty, similar to that of NA's ranked ladder difficulty (I have a friend who went back to NA recently and is currently in D2. He tells me NA is easier but I'm reluctant to make much a statement about this)   Ionia is definitely a much more competitive scene. When I was ranking up, I noticed silver played very much like high gold to low plat in NA/Bilgewater (dodging skill shots adequately, decent cs, plays and mechanics, etc.) and gold players played at what I would have considered to be mid-high plat. There's definitely a higher skill level in Ionia from my observations     Tencent as a company:     Tencent is basically the big daddy of online gaming in China with a high focus on revenue/profit   Tencent has a very bad reputation as a corporation, but there's nothing gamers can do about it because of Tencent's ties with the national government and it's legal rights to distribute and manage the most popular games in China right now - Crossfire and LoL. No other company can compete against Tencent     What I think about OP's Post:   It is true that skin/champion costs are higher and rune page costs are absolutely retarded (45 yuan for a 6300ip champion, legendary skins range from 99-260yuan and rune pages cost 129yuan for 2 extra pages)   However, it seems like OP's main concern is skins. Easy solution, use the program, LoLbox or Bigfoot and just get skins for free. I personally don't have much of an issue with how Tencent runs China LoL mainly because I don't feel much of a difference in service and product quality between NA and CN LoL and bypassing the issue of skins in CN LoL is just too easy. I only think this post has been up-voted so highly due to people's lack of understanding of playing League of Legends in China.
0	Just got out of a 6 month relationship myself. Told me she broke up with her ex a month before we started dating. I get a new job and end up working with his best friend. One thing leads to another we both found out. Both of us ditched her shit. She's alone and miserable and now and I'm friends with the other guy, he's actually pretty cool.
1	Semi-related. At a New Years party last night and ended up hopping on LoL with a couple guys. Decided to jump on Ez with my buds playing Shaco (intending on just trolling with box nests) and Sona.   Well, I was 5/0/1 before six minutes. Fun stuff.
1	My top 5:     Chronoshift (resurrection + healing is the obvious #1)     Stand United (I've always had a thing for flying and teleportation, and since there is no technical "flying" ability, teleportation is a definite #2 for me. Also teleporting to a person no matter where they are is better than TF's limited range teleport to any point in my eyes)     Sanguine Pool (Not as practical as some of these other ones, but probably the best party trick ever. And you can dodge bullets and shit, which is pretty cool too)         Charm (Charisma is one of the most important traits to have, magical charisma that works on anyone can get you jobs, relationships, friends, and financial opportunities. Knowing how to balance this with natural charisma would be the hard thing, reliance would lead to fake relationships)       Twilight Shroud (invisibility isn't one of my favorite things, but it would come in handy sometimes. And I don't want evelynn's because permanent invisibility unless I assault someone seems pretty...iffy.)
0	Repost of a comment from lower in the thread, because it applies here.   If you're a gay man that hasn't had a negative association with the word f-----, great, but that doesn't give you the ability to speak for the entire community.   1)There are thousands of people who have had that word thrown at them while being bullied, shamed, and physically assaulted. They don't get to choose to be offended by that word, the association is forced upon them. Same for the n-slur. This is stuff that continues in the present tense, and to demean them as "just being touchy" is heartless victim blaming. So stop.   2) Beyond all that, words are what we use to teach people meaning. By contributing to a culture that introduces young boys to the words gay and f----- as negatives, long before they have the nuanced or even complete understanding of sexuality that we do, is terrible. Imagine any number of preteens on xbox live hearing and regurgitating homophobic slurs, then eventually finding out what they mean. They've internalized that negativity, possibly even before they know their own orientation.   3) You're saying that sucking dick is objectively submissive, and therefore fair game as use for an insult. You're wrong on both counts. It's a personal choice that can go either way, but for my two cents: I say, and feel, that the one in the power position is the one who has the teeth around the most sensitive part of their partner's body.   Reddit is great because it gives us the best possible toolset for breaking down cultures that perpetuate harmful ideas and language. It's also terrible because it's hard evidence that people don't choose to use it that way.
1	Typically jacked people eat a lot of food because you need to to be jacked. There's no point in lifting if you aren't going to eat right. It becomes habit to eat like that, so after injury or stopping working out people will quickly gain weight because that's the amount of food they're used to.
0	I'm a server at an all you can eat buffet, our jobs are to take away plates that customers are finished with, and refill their drinks. As well as keeping the food bars wiped down and swept, making sure certain items on the bar are stocked, "Helping out wherever help is needed", and stocking up the plates, silverware, and cups. It's alot of work for only 2.83 an hour. Especially since ham planets go there and generate a stack of plates every 5 minutes, sit for 30 minutes to an hour, and leave 2 bucks.   Last night I have a party of 36 take up all of my section, and half of another servers section for 1 hour, not to mention the two hours we had to reserve it, so 3 hours total, for my whole section, we split the tip, leaving me with 3 dollars for 3 hours of work. It's bullshit at times. If we don't make enough, we're supposed to get 7.25 an hour. Serving isn't a minimum wage job, mainly because it is so labor-intensive. There's times I've pulled muscles carrying a tray full of half-eaten plates of food and drinks.   When you go to a restaurant, you're paying for the food when you get the bill. Gratuity or "tips" are for the server. They serve you, so why not be paid by you? TIPS means "to insure prompt service", so honestly you should pay your server before your meal starts, that way they'll know they've made money on that table, and they'll be much happier to serve you. Unless you're a scumbag, then wait til the end.
1	That's assuming the game ever gets past 20 minutes and people don't rage!surrender or the mid doesn't feed or... As a support main I'm completely aware of Janna's strategies, but with the AP scaling changes, now it's more difficult to build her with any kind of survivability. Her heals on the ult are less influential and really all her ult now is a glorified re-positioning device. She's also slower due to the removal of the global passive and the changes to her W. The base slow was ALSO reduced so her escape/peel mechanisms are also less effective.   She didn't need a nerf. Playing her was already risky enough - her speed and her strong slows / disrupts were what made her viable. Now all the opposing carry/support has to do is focus me, and leave my ADC completely vulnerable.   In comparison, I can play as Sona, have speed boosts, heals and massive movement/slow disrupts with her ult and Powerchord'd E. She does the exact same job and isn't nearly as fragile or as much of a target. Taric has the same story. My games with Sona/Taric tend to hover around 1/4/17 as an average, which I think is pretty alright.   Janna's strength was in her insane movement speed, which was nerfed, and her stuns/disrupts, which were also nerfed. Now if I give her a classic support build, her shields barely block any damage.   I've only been playing since August, so I'm still trying to crawl my way out of Bronze (I made ranked about three weeks ago). If you have a responsible, safe carry who does his job, doesn't take unnecessary risks and focuses on objectives rather than insanely chasing down kills, yes, Janna is still an alright pick. However, if you get the crowd of "jungle/top isn't open guess I'll adc even though I don't understand or know the mechanics of the role" (which is 90% of the time), then playing Janna is asking to get focused and destroyed and with the changes to her kit, there's really fuckall she can do about it if she gets focused. Therefore, playing a tankier or punchier support (Taric, Sona, fuck it, even Annie) will make my life supporting suicidal idiots easier.
0	Average is 5. Above average is 7. A little below above average is 6.
1	Sometimes team decides that 3rd pick should pick ,say, Irelia for 5th pick, but 3rd pick doesnt have the champion, then he picks a champion which assumingly never be picked, usually it's Evelynn, then the team writes evelynn=Irelia, meaning that the second team can't picked Irelia, they finish draft  and remake the game so everyone picks for himself.
0	I got offered a job at a great company, but I hadn't notified my boss yet because we were wrapping up some lose ends in the background check. My boss had just gotten a promotion and asked us to interview candidates for her replacement.   First Candidate walks in, hands us his resume. He was formerly the senior manager over the department that I would be working in at my new company...   Interview went well, but he ended up elsewhere. After the interview I volunteered to walk him to the door, and basically straight up told him that I was headed to work for his former company. He gave me some advice regarding why he left and reassured me that it was a great company, he just had some run ins with the plant manager.   Now I'm at the new company and it's weird to see his name as the approver on most of our training documents.
1	Oh my god.. Ahri players defending their instagib 1 defensive item adc or support, with dfg + 2 homing spells, or maybe it takes 2 out of 3 dashes from Spirit Rush(my god!). Like seriously I've played a lot of Ahri and I can say that she's broken. I've never felt playing an AP mid so much easier than with Ahri. You play to lvl 6 somewhat safe and you become a mobile beast all over the map or in case the jungler comes to gank you, you have 3 pseudo-flashes.   Ahri plays the role of an assassin too well as it is. I don't know yet how much the changes will affect the overall gameplay but I would like to think that Riot doesn't necessarily nerf things to the ground for fun, but instead try to find a balance so that for example Ahri should hit maybe DFG+Q+W+R(2/3) or that Ahri players should at least hit their point blank charm which makes the champion more skill dependent.   Also you can't compare Ahri to Fizz or Zed. Fizz has a very nasty laning phase during the first few levels, Zed or Ahri doesn't. You buy QSS, Zed is easier to kill, especially since he comes straight to your team during his ulti. A good Zed requires A LOT of mechanical skill and knowledge of the champion, while I think that Fizz and Ahri are actually not quite up to par with Zed at the moment. That being said, Fizz has more dmg packed in his kit than Ahri, or at least I feel like so because Lich Bane + qwe deal so much dmg that it can easily kill squishy targets late game, without the shark. But that being said I had the feeling that Riot was making Ahri more charm dependent on the kills and this would make her more towards Fizz. If that is the case, it's brilliant.
0	I don't think there's a "thing". Just $1 to make it accessible and to guilt anyone that will shell out for an app or coffee but can't be bothered to spend a pittance on something they use constantly (though they should just download 7zip). You also have to figure, since nobody buys it as is (well, almost nobody) they'd rather have a buck from a bunch of people than 30 bucks from nobody.   They paypal part was probably because of the ease and ubqiuity of the service. I know if I go to a site and they let me pay there or paypal, I pick paypal everytime.
1	True reason to max Q on Jinx is that the rockets get insanely high range insanely fast. By level 5 you're outranging Caitlyn. In lane.
1	ADC's shouldn't be some kind of role that gets literally shut out by a top laner with randuins or a midlaner with dfg. The whole idea here is that riot doesn't need to take stronger adc's and nerf them into the ground like they did sivir and draven but they need to make adcs exell at specific things. This is just a small example like lucian hes a lane bully he is meant to be that way and there's no reason to nerf him but champions like lets say quinn shes very unique in many ways but just the way she scales early and late make her an impossible champion to win with regardless if your good enough to solo carry. This isnt a good concept for a game because league has over 100 champions in it and about 17 are classified as adcs/marksman and i don't think i've seen anyone in challenger that mains adc and their top 3 champs aren't lucian, cait, sivir, or twitch. that's 3/4 out of 17 champions riot offers for marksman. Where the hell are the other 14??????????? They are useless and non-existent and for a good reason they cant deal with the season 4 meta of tanks being unkillable damage machines and mages that will instantly kill you even if you position well.
1	I couldn't agree more. It was incredibly painful to read his rage at countering burst damage...it seemed to upset him that to counter talon, you needed to survive the lane phase and build armor and hp. Or versus Galio, you needed to accept the fact that as an ap mid you won't be able to kill him alone, and as a result the counterplay is to farm as much as possible and then work together in teamfights to overwhelm him.   2/3 of galios damage comes from skillshots. Talon, like leblanc, is inherently squishy and as a result falls off late game. When the time comes that you can no longer combo the AD/AP carry in one shot, you have fallen off.   Honestly I see where he's coming from, and the point he is trying to make has merit. I think he just struggled in how to go about wording it, and utilizing the right examples. It is LESS FUN to counterplay Talon as Lux(race to WTFBBQ instaburst @ 6) then it is to counterplay Irelia versus Fiora. There are some matchups that are just SO FUN to counterplay that it makes others feel bland by comparison. This is what happens when the matchup relies more on build order/ganks/gold and less on a champions kit.   Starting cloth armor 5 pot as Akali versus Darius, and only using your Q to farm knowing that you cannot win any trades until you snowball off of a teamfight or get a gank? Unsatisfying.   That Irelia/Fiora matchup? As Irelia, stun during fiora sterioid, turn on true damage, time your ult to counter OR prepare yourself for hers, live with less then 100 hp, type WORTH in all caps all chat...all you need is some oral going on under your desk and you've reached the pinnacle of satisfaction.   As for his point on specific champions being unviable, I would say that almost all champions have a niche role or situation where they are the perfect pick. Who said 6 months ago that AP Yi was competitively viable? Last patch, AP Yi nerf after Alex Ich taught the world a lesson. The recent amazing game in which GSG ManDu whipped out jungle heimer in game 5 of NLB and blew everyone away within 20 minutes, the casters talking about how GSG said they had prepared a specific strat for blue side if the picks and bans were right...   Malzahar, "competitively unviable" but a champ built around dominating the laning phase and pushing fast with his supression ult and sustaining visions. If you're in a situation like Gambit Gaming was a few weeks ago @ IEM Katowice, and know that you need to pull out a win in under 28 minutes in order to advance? Would have been a great pick, but Khazix was open...lol. $$$ says we'll see more champs that people say are "unviable" show up in competitive play for various legitimate niche reasons...Volibear today, support Garen tomorrow?   Hopefully people see my point, because I saw Hashinshin's - I just wish he had done a better job articulating it.   EDIT:
0	While you seem to see porn as purely innocuous, like any dopamine-inducing activity it's inherently open to be abused.  While I truly believe you and your boyfriend can have a positive relationship towards pornography, many people become addicted to it and it causes real problems that affect relationships.  Again, this is not to say it affects everyone that way, but you seem to be missing the fact that people other than yourself might have a different relationship to it.  It's like saying, "am i the only one around here who doesn't care if her boyfriend smokes weed?"  Yeah maybe he doesn't have a problem with it but other people do.
1	I don't think the rune changes will affect jungler pages. Heres why:   Seals : Armor is still best in slot because it allows you to take less damage from jungle creeps and to survive junglers like lee, udyr, and xin's early invade potential.   Glyphs : MR/lvl were buffed which makes them for sure best in slot still. Mana regen is not vital because of blue buff and cdr is nice but tank stats are often better on junglers.   Quints : Again Cdr not necessary on most junglers especially with blue buff. The only thing that might be useful here is the buff to AS Quints, so I could see junglers that scale well with AS stacking it for a faster clear time but some math would have to be done here.
0	The brain (which is acting like a cat) is wanting to be let inside. Cats frequently beg to be let indoors. When the door is finally opened for it (an invite to the party), they just sit outside and don't walk in (the excuse not to come).
0	And here's why:   People  want , and  wanting  has nothing to do with anyone else outside of themselves (or yourself.) There is nothing more pure than someone's preference. It's what fuels our actions and pursuits, and elemental to our survival: "I want[prefer] this, so I will get it." More relevant to dating: "I want[prefer] this person to be in my life at [xx] capacity."   Now, think about your own wants, and how you hate it when the wants of others' conflict with your own. Why do we get mad when that happens? Because the other person's preference is threatening your potential happiness; because  without thinking of their feelings on the matter , they will be  taking away your power  to actively live your happy life.   So she/he decides to leave. FUCK. "Fuck them for them taking a jab at my happiness. How dare they have so much power over me?" Your ego is shaken up, and at that point you're breaking your own heart.  So change the patterns of your ego, and you'll realize that a she/he leaving is just another person on this Earth who existed without your companionship at some point, and wants to be there again.   It ain't easy to reprogram yourself, but you understand how your own ego works, and everyone has access to their own source code -- edit one line at a time. And it's not just about dating -- the fruits of any labor start from a seed of wanting.
1	This post was saying that he doesn't care that it is just as fair. It was more of a "how am I going to improve my skills and/or have fun even when I win due to an afk?" He's saying having your games pre-decided by who you are matched with feels hollow in comparison to a well fought game whether it is won or lost.
0	I'll just point out that none of those things would be a problem if you realized that karma doesn't matter.   My life isn't significantly different as a result of having more karma than when I started, and if I somehow earned a million karma, my life would still remain the same.   The sooner you realize that, and stop caring about karma, the happier you will be, I promise you. Just post, comment, whatever, and ignore the fake scores the hivemind assigns to you, they aren't an accurate representation of worth. Even fake money in a video game is worth heaps more than karma, since you can exchange it for enjoyment  within the confines of the game , unlike Reddit, where it's useful for nothing.
1	Picked Irelia; got my ass handed to me by a Bruiser Nidalee; She was too tanky. My support flamed me for everything. Next game I got matched with the support again, and they started flaming in champion select again. Went Irelia top again, killed their Renekton over and over, whilst the flamer from last game was feeding and blaming it on Taric. This person complained about getting retarded team mates all the time, but they flame and blame and can't accept when they make their own mistakes.
1	The most important thing is just to play and gain more experience. I used to build AS/cdr kennen (following a guide) because i saw it on mobafire (was a terrible build (soul shroud and malady and nashors) i played from level 10-20 with that build without realizing anything was wrong. but then as i learnt more about the game, I realized building AP was so much better. my point is, learn the items and what they do, then apply it in your situation (your team, enemy team)   there is no such thing as a standard build. at all. there maybe core items (eg. revolver on morde and vlad etc) but what you build really depends on your team. If you're playing tank, find out if your support is building aegis or not, if s/hes not see if you can slide it into your build. Another thing to note at this situation is how likely are you to teamfight? or would split pushing benefit your team the most? If you have lots of teamfighting potential, build aegis. Also, if you have a dual AP team, consider getting an early Wota to benefit your teamates   You should also keep the enemies' team in mind. For example, where most their damage comes from (whose the most fed) and build accordingly, for example if you are playing AD and their AP carry(s) are getting fed, you might want to consider buying a MoM, or if they have shittons of cc (or if they have a malz, urgot or ww who is most likely going to focus you), a quick QSS might not be a bad idea.   Another thing is to note what types of defenses the enemy team is building. If they are stacking armor, getting some armorpen is a good idea, same with mr.
1	This is a wall of text and I'm way too lazy to read it all. But what I believe this thread is about how you rage at your team. I know this game  is  can be frustrating sometimes but you have to keep in mind that League of Legends is JUST A GAME. I stopped playing ranked because I was fed up with the attitude of the players in that Q. I just stopped raging because you have no benefit from it, additionaly if you face trolls they will just feel better in what they are doing. So my advice is just to change your attitude and become a chilling guy . I don't rage at players that don't play well because everyone has a bad game once in a while. I don't rage at trolls because sometimes they are funny  and I have to admit that in very rare cases I tend to troll aswell. I DEFINITLY don't rage at people that play out of the meta. The only people I  rage about are flamers. In my opinion they do not deserve to play this game oh yes and I alse detest tryhards in normals and ARAMs. So I guess thats it. I simply just stopped careing about wether I win or loose I just play to have fun.
0	I was pleasently surprised/shocked to hear sentiment akin to this from the German mother (Elke) of my girlfriend at the time.  We were visiting the parents in Hamburg back when the Kursk russian sub crisis occurred and as it became apparent that the Russians were basically abandoning their poor sailors with no real rescue effort Elke cried out "If those were Americans, every ship in the US Navy would be on the way to save those boys!"  I was so used to criticism of America that I was stunned to hear such a sentiment of admiration.  It had added weight when I later reflected that Elke's father-in-law had died aboard a sunken German sub.
1	There is no best. Everyone has a counter, for Yi and Jax it's Quinn and Teemo (that blind makes them useless), for Nasus it's any early game champ who can zone him. And Vi melts Garen because of her passive armor pen. All that matters is being able to outplay someone. If you can outplay them then you win.
0	two years ago, it was about 1am and I was living at the beach.  We are jamming out to music drunk in my kitchen when we see a huge glow outside followed by an electrical pulse sound(like a tesla coil).  Then a girl screams "oh my god!".  My first thought was oh shit one of my drunk ass friends climed onto the roof and grabbed a powerline for stability. Nope, a powerline snapped in the wind on my street, bringing a transfrmer down with it.   I was hammered, but I ran outside.   Live wires were dangling over two houses next door to me sending sparks everywhere.  So I started yelling at my neighbors telling them not to come out the front door because there were wires everywhere, and I have seen enough WTF electrocution videos on here to know I don't want my neighbors to do it live.   The house across the street from me did not have any wires hanging on it but I looked over and noticed a small glow on their electrical box on the outside wall.  This was the point where I said to myself "oh shit it's time to save the day".  So I ran back inside my house and grabbed a fire extinguisher.  When I come back out the fire has already grown quickly and started creeping up the wall.  So I sprint across the street about 15ft from the downed wires.  They were so close I could hear them buzzing and popping on the ground.  Right as I reached the house another plume of sparks shot from the wires on the house next me.  I start blasting the fire with the fire extinguisher like a boss (It was honestly the coolest feeling ever because it was a serious fire at this point).  Then the girls start freaking out yelling at me to get away because it is dangerous.  I yelled back "no! i'm saving the day!!"  then continued blasting the fire away.   So after about five minutes pass the fire truck shows up with all of their guys pouring out of the truck ready for action.  Then I walk past them shirtless and in flip flops with my empty fire extinguisher dangling from one hand and say "Its under control guys, I already saved the day." They did not look happy that I spoiled their fun, so they told me to go inside because it was dangerous.  Then since I was drunk I kept yelling "I saved the day" as I walked proudly towards my friends.   Kinda felt like [this](   Then the firefighters came in with a thermal gun to check for hot spots in our walls.  as soon as they walked in they were greeted by about 4 hot dancing drunk girls in Bikinis.  Lucky for them the shitty ihome was charged.  They were all smiles from there on.  The best part was right as they left one of the girls goes "ooooh point it at me!"  The firfighter obliges and points the thermal gun at her then says " oh yeah! you are red hot"  Thankfully they left after that because I really thought I was in a porn for a second.
1	Note this isn't directed at anyone in particular, so if when say "you" then I just mean... you. Reading this.)   Because this subreddit is shit now. Everyone knows it, but it's growing at a faster rate than people are leaving. Seriously, look at the front page on any given day. 5 threads complaining about balance, 10 threads about drama, 5 cosplay posts (or this week, pictures of your shitty pumpkins), and 5 posts with real content.   Okay, Froggen flamed someone on stream. Then that thread pops up for no reason other than to create drama. That thread won't get Froggen banned, and it won't affect him in any way besides wasting 5 minutes of his life typing up an apology and going from 10,000 stream viewers to 9,950 stream viewers.   "I lost so much respect for Froggen today" shut the fuck up no you didn't. You, like everyone else, will ride his dick again at the next tourney when he farms 300 creeps in 20-something minutes and goes 10-0. What does that sentence even mean? How much "respect" did you even have for him in the first place? No one cares if you lost respect for someone, pro players hear that shit every day. They can buy pulp-less orange juice and someone will "lose respect" for them.
1	I honestly think that this is not a good idea. Viktor already got nice dmg and have a lot of power with the red trinket, which give him around 99 AP at level 18 for 100 gold, which is amazing early til midgame. The Problem is just the lategame where you missing but think about it. Imagine a 6 Item+Red Hexcore Viktor. He can already destroy 2-3 guys alone with his combo. If they give him 1 more item he is Jax Tier lategame because his burst is on a other level. Viktor has other problems right now but i think he will see some play these season because the meta is changing a lot right now. Support Viktor can be the future, but he needs a pro who will play him to get on top of the league, because no one plays him. Thats the problem.
0	Related: I used to work at best buy and I helped a guy buy a computer. He came in at least five times and I spent a ton of time helping him (not on commission just doing my job). Anyway he came in one night and bought a computer and said he couldn't take it home with him right then because it wouldn't fit in his car. Best buy offers a delivery service (which they charge for) but me being me I asked him how far away he lived and he said ten minutes and said I could just drop it off on my day off tomorrow on my way back from class.  He was really happy and so the following day I asked him for the address. He sent me the address and I popped it in my gps and started driving. Since I was at college I wasn't familiar with the area and turned out the ten minutes away was actually an hour in each direction. I just figured well I said I would do it so I drove all the way there and someone else was home to accept it. Guy never called to say thank you .. Never tipped me or anything... And as a broke college student I wasted all the gas I had. I was pretty mad at myself after that and stopped being so helpful to customers. Anyway.. What this guy did was the right thing and you being appreciative certainly made it worth it. It takes two people to make a nice gesture meaningful.
1	Okay. Let me break this down for you.   1 Greater Quintessence of Critical Chance imparts a +1.86% critical chance.   That means you are 1.86% more likely to score a single critical strike.   That in no way shape or form means that you WILL crit them. On any given attack a you have a 1.86% greater than normal  chance  to strike critically. There is no  guarantee  that you will.   Stack a couple of those runes, and your odds of a critical hit will be substantially higher than the norm. The maximum critical strike chance you can reach at level 1 without items is 20.25%, excluding Ashe's and Tryndamere's passive. but you are wrong in saying that you will absolutely no matter what in any given scenario crit. That simply isn't true.   We may well be arguing semantics at this point, but ultimately i'm technically correct - which, as we all know, is the best kind of correct.
1	Type: Targetted spell   Range: 550   Cooldown: 8s   Damage: 300 (+ 90% AP)   CC: Stun (1.5s)   Cost: 100 mana     vs     Type: Skillshot   Range: 1500   Cooldown: 6s   Damage: 230 (+ 65% AP) - 575 (+ 162.5% AP)   CC: -   Cost: 90 mana       Why bother taking a champ you have to get up close and personal with to mid/high damage early/midgame when you can pick the easier choice of safely spamming spears and traps from up to 1500 range, dealing up to twice the damage?   /
0	Thanks asshole you're only 5 years late. Smh why didn't you fax this to me years ago?   24 years old   6 grand in debt   Not great credit, some borrowers will lend money.
1	the problem with "being a fan, not a fanboy" is that to the outside this is usually not distinguishable, seeing as the difference between "fan" and "fanboy" is only in how aggressively they defend their own team.   look at it this way:   youre standing in a room, and people are talking. all of a sudden a bunch of machester united (or whatever your football club of choice is) fans come by, they act loud as fuck, are drunk, and try to start a fight with anyone that says they dont think that manchester will lose the next game.   who will you notice more? this obnoxious group of people, or the guy sitting in the corner watching the game, rooting for manchester, even though he thinks theyll lose the game hes watching? can you distinguish the two, if, against all odds, manchester wins, and both the "silent fans" and the "loud fans" celebrate (probably together) that their team won?   this is observational bias at its core, especially, since in votes like those on lolesports.com dont really distinguish between the two groups, and votes are based on "who do you WANT to win?", instead of "who do you think will win?", and fanboys/hardcore fans tend to vote more than the "realistic fans", who probably wouldnt vote against their team, even if they voted to begin with. they probably would not vote before they voted for the other team.
0	Here's what you do, since it won't be cold yet for a while. Find a winter coat of each of theirs. Go outside. Shit into some sort of container. Freeze the shit. Liquid oxygen is best, but computer cleaner may work in a pinch, or, if you have a lot of time and a freezer you don't care about, that'll work too. Cut a slit in the bottom of the jacket pocket. Put half the shit through the slit, and work into the inner portion of the jacket. Repeat with other jacket. Place coat back into back of closet like nothing happened. Enjoy your disgusting revenge.
0	This problem, I have it. Whenever I need something, I will either get a: speech about how we she/we are under money this week, Speech about how I should ask my dad for money (who ironically is poorer than us, but still withdraws from me the fact that he is poor and still provides), or told to pay for it. I used to have 200$ in my bank I was proud of. It's 20$ now. I don't exactly know how I am going to have a life for Junior year.   Anyway, I live with my mom who is a librarian and is deeply religious. My dad is a janitor at a school/church (who is super-mexican, where my 50% comes from). I'm not greatly religious and can understand common sense, so I think if your rich, teach your child about the fact that a dollar is fucking hard to earn nowadays and how much it is worth. And, if you are poor, teach them the same, but don't fucking tell them each time they need or want something that they are 300$ behind cash today and still will ask you to pay for their gas if you want to get to school. I feel terrible.
1	I think the problem is that athene's unholy grail gives way too much mana regen. If athene's were nerfed, then Nidalee would have a cap on the number of spears she can throw without some cheesy nerf to her kit.   This also applies to champions like Ziggs/LeBlanc. Athene's is really game breaking in my opinion as it is promoting a poke/disengage/waveclear meta that minimizes risk. This is boring to watch and creates an unhealthy disparity between the solo-queue meta and the competitive meta. Even champions that are meant to be played as assassins (LeBlanc) are played as poke champions in OGN/LCS.   Yes, many champions (mid and support) would require kit changes, but I think don't think the meta will ever change from poke/disengage without nerfs to this absurd item. Athene's essentially removes mana gating after level 6 or so for most AP champions. This is extremely unhealthy for the meta. Many of the champions that are OP because of athene's, such as LeBlanc, Mid Soraka/Lulu, cannot be nerfed by direct kit nerfs without effecting other healthy playstyles of these champions. (DFG LeBlanc, support Soraka/Lulu   If you just look at the gold valuation (taken from lolwiki:   It is obvious that Athene's is OP.   Gold Value   60 ability power = 1305g 40 magic resist = 800g 15 mana regen = 900g 20% cooldown reduction = 633g Total Gold Value = 3638g   Gold Efficiency The base stats are 139.9% gold efficient, without the passive effects.   140% efficient BEFORE the stupidly strong passive? No wonder every mid gets it.
1	Still comps werent super important. The game was over by the time team fights started. Yes Dyrus was feeding but it was because of great play on Reginovers part and his early ganks. The Cass pick did well but it could have been anyone honestly because of the advantage that those kills provided. Also Dyrus tends to feed but fnatic shutting down Bjergsen hurt more because of how TSM plays around him.
1	Honestly, I don't know why people are telling you to watch streams or view guides to improve your own play. Assuming that your item builds are decent, I think that you just need to focus on your mechanics (i.e. farming). Don't worry about improving your decision making just yet. Most people at this level of play focus solely on killing whoever their laning opponent is, and as a result average ~100 cs in a 30 minute game. Practice last hitting in custom games. If you farm well, you can carry HELLA hard.
0	Forced myself to touch-type in 10th grade.  My friend could do it and would finish his programming assignment in 10 minutes then fuck off for the rest of the period.  That was all the motivation I needed:
1	Everything is incomplete and where you go into more depth you leave out other important info:   Mid lane, you say its about dominating? No it's not you need to just NOT LOSE YOUR LANE (general laning goal) and make sure you help force/stop dragon when needed.  If you feel like you need to dominate your lane and you aren't sure you can beat people in your elo range you should be counter picking or playing support.   Calling MIA everytime someone leaves lane is not what makes a player good, it's something you do when you realise the rest of your team is retarded.   On the last hitting, it can often be good to push your lane, if you're up against swain just push hard, he loses CS and you're free to do what ever. If you're playing Morgana you should be pushing your lane too, as this is super easy and safe and other champions dentally have disadvantage last hitting under turrets, there are more specific exampels, a more general one is that when your enemy leaves in lane, push the crap out of it so the turret takes the CS.   So the entire point of not pushing is wrong, the only reason you don't push is so you don't lose CS (your minions killing his while you can't reach) because if you want to last hit at this point you need to OVER EXTEND meaning you YOUR SELF move to far ahead.   You (and other people) make loads of thread about what "good" player should be doing while it simply is just bullshit, you get good at a game by putting time into it and learning and understanding it. I've played so many games last hitting is just automatic, if I then try I hardly miss any.  I understand the advantages my champion has in lane and other situations and press these to gain the upper hand, score kills or denie xp/farm   You can take the time to get all the core concepts out on paper and talk about advantages (theorycraft) and what not but you still need to test it, you still need to get the feel for it, you still need to build up the muscle memory to get the control going. Getting decent at this game is 100% not sucking on mechanics and just plain out farming the dude against you in lane. Once you get into a decent level of ranked games you might need some extra concepts.
1	I'm not sure, I think the top korean teams are still holding back a bit.  I think those teams know they don't have to give it their 100% to beat western teams so they just kind of coast along.   If you ask me, SSW and SSB are going to play on a completely next level when they play against each other.  And the winner of that will most likely go on to win Worlds in a COMPLETELY dominating fashion.
0	When I had my last child I was 170 lbs  which is chubby for 5'7" but not bad post partum.   Today I am 275. In just 7 years.  The doctor said there was nothing wrong with me, I should exercise.    I haven't had fast food in two years nor soda in 18 months. I put in minimum 30 minutes on the eliptical daily until I'm in so much pain from my knees and ankles that I have been prescribed narcotics. Recently it was discovered that the Mirena IUD the doctors fitted me with after the birth of my child can cause uncontrolled weight gain in some individuals.  This was NOT  a specified side effect of the medication although now there are lawsuits.  I have been riduculed harrased bullied and nearly committed suicide as the weight and horrible teasing got to me (emotional issues IS a side effect of my Mirena).   Thank you, random redditor for not hating me based solely on a condition I am now trying to rectify.  I have an appointment to change my birth control method and the nutritionist is going to try y to help me not need gastric bypass to be normal again.  No, I have no intention of joing the lawsuits but maybe I should?   What would you do?
0	See, i would've understood that, but the fact that the sidewalk was in a residential area (no signs, clear sidewalk), and that there was an open bike lane is what got me upset. I mean cmon, he even stopped at a stop sign before turning onto the next street.
1	I like to check the minimap as my auto attack animation goes off for a last hit and last night I saw the enemy jungler bot and the enemy midlaner mid so I dived straight onto the enemy top laner who was out of position. 2 seconds later the enemy jarvan jungler eq's out of the top lane brush and I barely escaped with my life and was left thinking wtf I saw you bot...
0	When checking a lotto ticket (in Colorado at least) if the winning is more then our drawer is allowed to hold ($50 in most stations but $200 in ours) then a message opts us to cash it out or to not and return the ticket.  At this point we ask the customer of they would like to wait for us to vend the cash from our dispenser. Which could take up to 20-30 minutes. Or they could just take the ticket back and try to cash it elsewhere.   If our drawer can only hold $200 and they win an amount equal or greater.  Then that shuts our drawer down until we can vend enough money to begin doing cash transactions. This hurts our ability to "properly serve" customers as you stated.   Also keep in mind that the $200 my drawer holds is the entire contents of the drawer, pennies, nickles, dimes, quarters, and bills and there is no guarantee that I will have bills larger then a 10 at all.
0	My CSB We had a tradition in my unit that when ever we had a new arrival, we took him out that night, unless we were going to the field the next day.  We took out a new Corpsman to our platoon to a popular bar, but it was the middle of the week a few days before payday and the place was dead.  One of the few woman in the place was this extremely hot girl that was dancing up a storm by herself.  She was incredible, she moved like a liquid snake.  We were all eyeballing her pretty hard and when she went to the bar I decided to talk to her.  All my buddies were telling me she was out of my league, but I figured she cant say yes if I don't ask her.  So I went up and starting chatting her up.  After a few minutes she tells me she had a big fight with her boyfriend and broke up with him and that she was meeting someone there that night.  I figured ok, she's either letting me down easy or isn't interested.  My buddies give me some grief when I get back to my table about striking out and I figured that's the end of it.       About 30 minutes later I'm playing a video game, (hey it was the eighties!) that they had in the back and just got the high score.  I put in my initials and started a new game when I heard a woman's voice behind go "Hey who beat my high score?".  I turn around and its the hot snake girl.  She was pissed and demanded the chance to get top score again.  I told her she was FOS that girls weren't good at video games.  She told me I was FOS and that she could beat my new high score.  So I accepted the challenge and even tossed in some quarters and off we went.  She beat my new top score, then I beat hers again.  As this was going on I asked where her date was, and she said got stood up.  I remarked that the guy was either gay or beyond stupid, because she was built like a playboy playmate.  She really liked that comment for some reason and told me if he didn't show up in the next 5 minutes she was taking me home with her.      He never showed, so off we went.  She wore me out for the next few hours and we had a great time.  She was dropping me off at the barracks the next morning and I asked her about seeing her again and she told me it was a one time thing, that she was going to get back with her boyfriend.  I was disappointed of course and asked her why.  She said "I like 'em big and dumb, you're not really my type."  What?  Why not I replied?  "You're too smart. I wouldn't be able to get away with stuff like this with you."  "Besides, I'm going to beak up with him again in a few more months anyway."  Really I said?  Why?  Oh that's when my husband come back from float. (Deployment for you non Marine types.)  I stammered, "Wait a minute you're married?"  I thought you said he was just your boyfriend and you guys just broke up?  "Oh I do have a boyfriend, and we did break up, I'm also married."  "It's not a problem, we have an open relationship when he's deployed."  Are you serious I asked?  She said "Yeah, I can have a boyfriend while he's gone, and he can hit all the LBFM's he wants when he's over seas.  "It works out pretty good."  "We decided to be honest with each other and we knew it would be hard to be faithful when he was gone all the time."   Ok what ever works, who am I to judge.  I hopped out and went into my barracks.  I saw her again at the same club a few weeks later with her boyfriend.  The guy was as big as a wall and about as smart.  She saw me and even introduced us. I don't think he had a clue what was going on,  I made tracks really fast just in case.
0	In historical context, during WWII, the Nazis were not the crazies. In fact, they did offer a solid financial improvement via plundering the things owned by people they disenfranchised. Along with replacing positions of these minorities with German citizens lowered the unemployment rate (Jews were not counted towards unemployment). This, with a massive increase in the national debt, basically paid off the German people in a transition to a war economy in six years prior to the outbreak of the war.   The average (non-minority) German started making more money, had a much smaller chance to be unemployed, gained great medical care, saw huge changes to infrastructure (the Autobahns, railways) that helped them get from place to place... and all they had to do was to continue blaming the Jews and other minorities. That was much easier, because it looked to be working.   This was of course the short term plan, because this is not sustainable economy. Hence, the start of the conquest as soon as the exploitation stopped being profitable. The beauty of this choice was obvious from a financial standpoint. The massive amount of infrastructure built, the huge increase in factory production, and the transition to a war economy had been underway for six years, fueled by stripping thriving Jewish communities of all the resources they had, as well as selected people that were anti-Nazi.   What continued from there was basically the plundering of conquered states of resources, and starting the taking from minorities over there as well, this time to the extreme as exterminating people was already something that the previous years of financial success had made people turn a blind eye to. Nobody wanted to know how things were taken from the Jews, what happened to them, or why they vanished. Because if you were turning a blind eye to that, everything was better, and the Jews weren't there - so it must be that. It was easy to believe that the Jews had ruined everything. People wanted to believe that. Because now they were given a new, beautiful house by the government (used to belong to a Jewish family since executed), a nice, decently paying job in their own shop (the tailor was shot in the head for being gay, and the government repays loyalty), and the kids got great medical treatment for free.   Most Nazis had to swallow one lie: It was someone else's fault for all the huge mess that happened before the Nazis. Other than that, all the backing for the Nazi regime was perfectly rational. From a sheer economic standpoint, the citizens were better off. They had become a military empire, feared by their enemies, only such a short while after the defeat at the last war. People were joined together behind one cause, making their country great. And the guys in control, well, they seemed to know their shit, because wow, look at how things are better now.   Swallow one lie. That was all that was asked. And you get a better life. Your friends get better lives. The entire country gets better. Just one lie.   The Nazis were not crazy. They were average people. Hitler was popular. And he convinced people to do one thing, and that thing is so easy... blame someone else. People clung to that. They did their best to ignore any evidence of the wrongness of it. They were not crazy. No one wants to admit that their lie protected the greatest war crime ever committed. That they turned a blind eye.   ... they didn't know. Actually, they wouldn't have supported it if they knew. They were lied to. It was so convincing. You have to believe everyone, or else what can you believe? It was just a mistake. Everyone was misguided by monsters. Those people were evil. How could anyone have known?   This is a thought process that explains why being a Nazi was not, and to a great extent still is not, an act of insanity. All you need to believe is one lie. One sweet and easy to believe lie. One that says "it's not our fault". It's a soothing lie. One that children say to themselves when things look screwed up. It comes so naturally. And everything will be better.   One lie.
0	Dude, I thought we went over this. Your mom has undoubtedly taken a big ol load all over her face from your dad at some point. Not one of those weird thick loads that are about the consistency of boiled glue, but a big liquidy, well hydrated shower of a load. That shit was all in your mom's bangs, her eyelids, dripping down her chin, the whole 9 yards. (Super sad cause that's basically like your brother but your mom keeps scooping that shit into her mouth and making an overly exaggerated poping noise when her fingers break the vise like threshold of her lips) during this time your mom probably stored the smell of your dad's cum in her mind. Your cum probably doesn't smell much different.

0	The real problem with ADHD, ADD, and dyslexia are not that they are real problems that many people suffer from, but that a majority of people decide for themselves that they have it and/or are misdiagnosed with it and then they use it as an excuse. I've spent several years tutoring college level students for all levels of math and many of these students I will end up working with for a long time through multiple terms. What I come across more often than I would like are people who clearly have no disorder but use their disorder for excuses as to why they don't do their homework or go to class or study, etc. "I don't go to class because I have ADHD/ADD and I can't focus on the teacher". "I don't take notes because I have dyslexia". "I didn't do my homework because I just couldn't focus on it". These are people whom I've worked with one on one for hours and hours and I've seen them write down a problem, listen to me explain things, do problems on their own, etc. What I see the majority of the time (I'm talking 95% of the students) is that these students are fully capable of doing whatever they put their mind to, but the moment something gets too tough for them, like they don't understand a problem within the first 15 seconds of reading it, is a complete failure to even try and an excuse being made due to their disorder.   I'm sorry to ramble on about this, but I've worked with hundreds of students over the years and a lot of them are medicated for disorders like these and a lot of them are not medicated but diagnosed and it is extremely rare for me to come across a student who appears to actually have a problem. Instead what I see constantly are completely normal people who don't want to put in the effort to learn and fall back on their disorder as an excuse not to try harder.   For example, there was one girl whom I'd worked with for 2 terms. I had seen her weekly and helped her with homework and general questions. I'd heard her read out loud from the textbook, her notes, my notes, etc. One day she tells me she has dyslexia and that's why she has a hard time with the story problems. I didn't say anything to her, but I was thinking: no, you don't have fucking dyslexia, you just have the same problem that almost every single fucking person has, which is a difficulty in interpreting words into math. It's hard for everyone, even me! And the thing that really annoyed me was that I had heard this excuse so many times before when in reality there is absolutely nothing wrong with the person except for the fact that they don't study everyday (more like once a week for most students, or just when they see me).
1	It seems like you struggle a bit during your laning phase since Talon got first blood on you and your farm doesn't seem too good. But farm is something that you can always work on, you can't have perfect farm every game.   One thing I would suggest however is communicate with your team, even the littlest things matter like where it's warded (especially when it come to doing baron/dragon). Also, if you get a inhibitor (i.e You get mid inhib) tell team to group top or group bot. If you get top or bot inhib, tell team to group the opposite side of the destroyed inhib.   But yeah,
1	I think  Lux  is the most underrated champion.  People seem to not realize all the things she does for her team.  In addition to being an AOE AP nuker, she provides a lot of AOE CC, with low cooldowns, an AOE shield that applies itself initially passing over teammates and reapplies itself on the way back to Lux.  She can use her AOE root and AOE slow for both engaging and disengaging enemies, she has a built in Lich Bane.  To top it all off she has a low CD semi-global ult(40-something seconds) that does almost 1k damage in the late game.
0	Yeah I had a teacher do something just as fucked-up to me. I spent 6 weeks in the hospital one spring and I got written permission from the dean to take "Incompletes" in all my courses and finish them  by the end of the next semester I was enrolled in , which the dean was aware was the next fall. (To make this more clear, I missed classes from spring break through spring finals, and I was given until mid-December to make up the missed assignments and tests.)   One of my teachers insisted that "we had agreed" all my work was supposed to be done by the end of the  summer  semester following my hospitalization. OK, whatever, lady, I'll try. I got almost all of her work finished over the summer via online submissions, but the online final she had set up for me glitched and wouldn't load. I sent her screenshots of what was going on within five minutes and then attempted again several more times, but since I had already opened and closed the assignment, the program wouldn't allow me back into it.   So she knew that the test she gave me gave me technical difficulties and I was living with my parents in a city two hours away, recovering from my illness and surgeries, and had no way to get to campus until my mother could take me to move back into the dorms for the fall. This teacher was fully aware of that, and had agreed to the terms set by the dean for my incomplete coursework.   Once I got to campus for the fall, I contacted her at least twice a week throughout the entire semester to try to schedule a time to do the final for her class. She ignored all my calls and emails, and the handful of times I showed up at her office, scoffed at me and said the words "I don't have time for you." She was really bitchy about it, but I tried to just let it go and assume she meant she was busy with her current classes or her children or something and that she'd get back to me. I should have gone to her department head much sooner than the last week of the fall semester, but I didn't think she was seriously not going to let me take her final until it got that late and she was still actively sabotaging my attempts.   The department head sided with the teacher. He said that she had already told him what was going on and that I might try to "come whining to him about it" (Whining? Really), but that "we had agreed to a deadline," (No, we didn't.) and that I was just panicking because I had been "lazy and disrespectful to her" (motherfucking WHAT). He told me that regardless of any personal issues between the two of us, he could not allow me to retake her final because the end of two semesters had passed since it was assigned to me. I showed him the written and signed agreement with the dean of the college, stating that I had until 5pm on December 17 to finish all my coursework from the hospitalization, and he wouldn't budge on it.   I took the issue to the dean of the college, who told me that "this late in the game, he couldn't do anything about it." It was a fuckton of bullshit.   I never got to take her final and ended up dropping a letter grade in the class...  after  she had told me that the gradebook for that semester was permanently closed, which was the reason she "couldn't" let me take the final that late. The douchebag department head isn't the department head anymore though, so there's that.
1	Well on stream after the game, Doublelift saw the original GIF post and kind of rolled his eyes at it. Kelby was like "that's a great play" or something and maybe Loco says "what'd you do?" and then Doublelift replies "Shen went to taunt me and I pressed E" in a very "you guys are easily impressed" manner.
0	If you can imagine these scenarios and getting through them together, however, then it sounds a little more promising then a proposal and/or marriage day dream, in my opinion. I imagine marrying Tyrese Gibson all the time, doesn't mean we would stay together if he went bankrupt and fell into a depression that started a drug dependency.
1	20% cdr is usually really effective when trying to reach the cap cleanly, for example mages can get Morellos + Ludens and there, you have a strong damage, mana sustaining core that also gives you the cdr cap, AD champs have other options so they can hit the cap and most champs that use cdr runes is to have it available from the get go because they're cooldown gated. (Zed, Riven for example)
0	There were these two bullies in my old school who were like this, except one time the kid pushed me over and told me to respect my elders, and then the other bully punched him in the face for pushing me before he got to push me, and told HIM to "respect your elders" cuz he was a day older than the first guy...
1	I'm not really a newbie, but I've just picked up Nidalee, when my best champion is certainly Riven. So, after playing a few games (inspired by TPA Stanley);   How the hell does that guy do as much damage as he does? He builds Chalice, Wriggles, Phage, Spirit Visage. And he still chunks people and dukes it out with his lane opponents. How? I seem to hit like a wet blanket. I'm running 21(hybrid)/9/0 with AD red, Arm yellow, MR Blues and MS Quints. What do?   *This is specifically in teamfights and such, I've had no trouble winning even lanes, he just seems to make himself useful which I find really hard.
0	My circle of friends contains a few theatre majors, and one of them is actually working in the industry. Her focus was set design, and she was damn good at what she did. She was basically the best in her year in her focus. Even then, on top of her regular job working at a copy shop, she had to volunteer for what nearly amounted to a second full time job for several years before she finally broke into the industry.

I feel where OPs coming from- I grew up in a welfare family who couldn't afford to buy blankets (we used towels and older blankets that were full of holes) or new clothes. After I graduated, I went on welfare and bummed around trying to "make it as an artist" while allocating $20 a fortnight to groceries. I used to make lime cordial ice blocks to keep the hunger at bay.   Anyway. I didn't get my first job until I was 22, and eventually went back to uni and got my degree. Started working full time in 2011, which was the year I lost a lot of friends. I hung out in goth-ish circles, and one of the "queen bees" would apparently bitch about me having what she called middle class syndrome- that is, selling out and caring more about money than... uh... sitting around smoking weed and being "free" I guess.   Alot of the artsy/goth crew I saw as my tribe would hang out in the mid-week during the day, so I stopped going out as much. Last year I lost my boyfriend of 4 years because when we met, we were both people who would sit around on welfare with no ambition or goals, content to play games or watch Simpsons all day. He didn't want to change that lifestyle and I was exhausted from being the only one who could pay for things/drive us places/etc., but most importantly, the only one of us with plans for the future which were facilitated by my job.   As soon as I started working full time, I could allow myself to have dreams that never would have occurred to me when I lived below the poverty line. I earn $56k a year which is far from rich, but after having nothing for so long, I feel like a millionaire. I never have to worry about having enough money to make ends meet, I'm very comfortable, and I can save up for trips.   But at the same time, I miss the crowd I used to hang out with. I still have friends in those circles, but most of the people I hang out with now are fellow workers who are getting married and having kids. Now I'm sort of wondering if I'm happier being employed, comfortable, and alone, or if I should've just stayed an underemployed artist. Then my boyfriend and I would've gotten married and had a family, which is what I really want. All the dreams I had for the future that came from having a job became unobtainable after he left.   Gah, rant.
1	Account for 15 mins? Also, there is a difference between playing comfortable and playing smart. Nobody could argue against that there are many cases of teams, not only in LoL, that throw matches because they start playing lightly. But my question was to target why people even want to get baron in the first place when the game was already in their favor. Indeed, it is true that many baron claim fights cause throws, but I think you are overlooking the bigger issue that less games would be thrown if players would not risk going for baron.
1	I completely agree with this. I started playing league in about September last year, however I climbed to 30 quickly and began playing ranked. At first I was stuck around 1000 Elo in S2. Then s3 came around and I sucked bad at first and ended up in Bronze 4. After several weeks of win some, lose some I began to get annoyed with the constant raging and bad decision making. I decided to take it upon myself and quit being that guy who always tried to carry at mid or adc. Instead I began jungling. That was about two weeks ago. Now I'm about to go to silver 5 and it's been less than 40 games. In bronze as long as YOU know what to do in the situation you can lead your teammates. As the jungler, I don't try and carry alone. I perform my role, and do it well. I would say that my 72% win rate in the last two weeks speaks for itself.
0	See, there's just not enough information here.   Transgender could mean pre or post op.  Pre means that person still has a penis, and I'm not interested in a relationship with someone who has a penis.  From what very little I know from the googlin', transgenders rarely undergo surgery as transsexuals do.   Now, that's my decision.  The op is well within his right to make that same judgement call.  And I think it's a bit hypocritical to adopt the mindset that gender is a choice, and is malleable, and to choose to identify according to how you feel, and yet simultaneously judging others who identify themselves as (assumptions were made here) male attracted to females.   Though, who knows.  I can't make a judgement call because you've got a one-line post, just as I can't make a judgement call based on the op's mindset.  The 14 words s/he's posted on the topic don't really give a lot of detail, just like your 9.   As for myself, I've never been put in the same position. I know zero people that openly identify as either transgender or transsexual, and of those zero, zero percent of them find me attractive, and of those zero people I find zero of them attractive.  And I'm not beyond the physical barrier enough to initiate a date with the zero of the zero that I know that I find attractive without finding something physically attractive about them.
1	If they are getting past your wards, you are doing it wrong. I always start with one ward  towards the north entrance of the tri-bush to river exit, so that way I can see if a jungler runs from the tri-bush, or comes through river. As soon as I can afford it, I will always drop one in the tri-bush, one in the river near dragon, and then situationally I will drop one in the far side of the lane bush on the opposing team's side. It is your job to keep COMPLETE vision of the lane, and to let your team know when they are coming. Keep your ping hand strong, and don't fucking be afraid to drop millions of the fuckers.     Play a support that can capitalize on mistakes. Blitzcrank, Taric, and Leona are the best for this. Soraka is highly outdated, and Sona is decent, but requires a slightly more advanced playstyle. Lulu is situational, and requires more team play to be effective. You want bursty supports with hard cc because then you can punish enemy laners for making bad mistakes, while outputting tons of damage that will help your laner get kills     Know how to make decisions. Sona runs up level 1 to taric and graves at level 2? Good players will know that sona can be burst down easy, even at level 2, as long as both players react quickly and ignite. Support gone up the river to ward? Jump on that ADC, as long as your team mate is within bounds I would even flash. Drop him 100-0 just like that, throwing all your summoners as long as you know you have him. Playing hard cc tanky supports really helps you be a more direct player, because you usually make half the plays. Especially Taric, I'm not sure the exact number but he's running around with 150 or so armor if you build aegis, and you're basically another tanky support initiator. Know when to fight and not to fight.     Learn from your experience. Pay attention to what went wrong. Sometimes, your ADC will be a complete dumbnut and will screw everything up, but you have to learn to isolate these and not pretend like everytime it was their fault. You will make mistakes too, and learn from them. Actually think about what you did wrong, and it helps even if you say it in chat. This way people don't flame you and see you as responsible, and chills the rage a little bit. It also makes it more likely for you to fix the problems.       Few tips and tricks for bot lane -Quickly start to realize what kind of adc you have. Some will be responsive, some will not. Some will ALWAYS go in, even when you're just trying to drop some harass. Learn and plan accordingly   -Don't try to ward the river while they are pushed to your half of the lane. They can easily just run up and kill you, especially if their jungler is nearby. I still make this mistake a lot.   -Pay attention to cooldowns/levels. Whenever I play a Taric vs Sona lane, once I get ult I will immediately just make it rain on one of them. I do this because I know by the time my ult is back up, theirs will be just getting up (assuming they used it). Sometimes this is not smart, but you will learn when it is a good or a bad thing. Pay attention to when they burn flashes, ignites, exhausts, and act on them. Sometimes there is a 30 second window between your exhaust being up and theirs, and that is all you need to start the snowball   -Watch for position. The ideal positioning in a lane is adc being more towards the river, center of the lane, while support is in the lane bush, parallel to the adc. If someone is sticking out way further then the other, you can usually burst someone down before the other person can get into the fight. If they are together though, and both sides are about the same health and cooldowns, then be careful initiating onto the support, as the offchance they survive you will be screwed because now they will drop their cooldowns on your adc and you will harshly lose the engage.   -Know how to play the late game. I'll keep using Taric because I see you like him. Your job is to support the adc. You guys are in a team fight? Your job is to peel for your adc. Save your stun for whoever gets to him first/whoever is the biggest threat, while saving your exhaust for the same threat after he's stunned (if he's not already dead) or a new target. The only time you should be leading with a stun and burst combo onto someone is if someone is wildly out of position, and you are the only one in range/only one with balls to engage. Like if their ap carry is right up front clearing minion waves, while the rest of their team goes "cya gaiz" you fucking flash stun that little bitch AND SHOW EM WHOS BOSS IN THIS FUCKIN RANKED GAME.
0	Obviously him neglecting his children isn't acceptable either, but it falls back to the situation being exacerbated by this woman's crazy.   Two things make me almost certain that she's making up his faulty ways pre-breakup:     She never made mention of them until she constructed the memories in a disgusting effort to justify her actions.     She is probably actually disconnected from reality in more than one dangerous way if she can conclude that a guy watching porn in today's world is somehow a malicious act (without having discussed predetermined boundaries of course, which would turn this into a simple trust issue, but it's not) or even mildly abnormal.       This being said, I've seen it more than once in my own and others' relationships, where the guy is almost unavoidably often an asshole in the eyes of the woman, for more reasons than can be listed or even logically presented, while the guy is forced to laugh or joke about it as the perception slowly becomes an, albeit most likely subtle, psychological predisposition mainly through repetition and peers agreeing for the same illogical reasons. It's a stupid thing to watch happen and flat out mind-numbing to deal with.   I'm just ranting now.
1	I don't like it because there is no counterplay.   I mean, there is no actual counterplay to Teemo' ult (and Riot said they're working on it) but think about the other champs affected by this item.   Twitch, Shaco, Talon... They lose so much with this item and they can't do anything about because it's permanent.
1	I totally disagree with you.. because you cant forget the luck factor, off course if you bellong in a league you ll get ther.. but sometimes the getting stuck in a league is a real issue.. im Gold I trying to get plat before season ends and I can say that I m really bad luck, because I never have luck .. every time I get a crazy mofo that trol picks the game.. And makes it a lot harder.
1	On the pbe she has not proven to be very op, though that is pbe and the general pbe consensus has been proved wrong before once pros start experimenting.   She is strong early and mid game, with good dueling, but her late game and team-fighting is not as good as the most popular ADC right now. Also her vault and ult are not as good as they look at first. Vault makes you close to melee range for a second, and you can be hit and CC'd in that time. You have to be very aware who you are using it against and it they can make you pay for it. This makes using it as an escape require a little more skill. In short its much more limited than a more straightforward dash (small bonus though, its great for charging a statik shiv. it you use it at max range it basically fully charges it. If you time everything right you can get a ss proc, use vault, get another ss proc and your passive at the same time. That is a decent burst)   Her ult is.....well lets just say I predict a lot of people getting themselves killed her first week. It turns you melee and doesn't give you many anything for added defense. If you use it unwisely you will get yourself killed. Its good at chasing fleeing enemies or for fleeing from enemies, but compared to other ADC ults which can actually win teamfights its lacking.
0	I haven't seen many episodes of Pawns Stars but the ones I have seen it has a lot of historical context with all the stuff they buy, sure there is some random shit at times but every item they give a brief history on it or the person to whom the item relates to.   I would rather see one 30 minute show and learn about a model T car or a 200 year old gun or a relic once owned by a very famous/influential person than watch a two hour long documentary on one topic that puts me to sleep  or bores me to the point of changing the channel.
1	As a silver player, I much prefer this system to the previous "Elo System" since it feels like an accomplishment to get from silver 1 to gold 5. Where before, what did it matter to go from 1350 to 1415? Where is the acheivement?   Since Plat and Challengers seem to prefer the old system, maybe they should make it so that once you get to Plat, it converts your standing to an ELO so they can continue to compete with each other for a higher  ELO to get their acheivement. This would fix the problem of ppl sitting on their spot in challenger.
0	I think this thread is better than most.   Yeah, there are guys who place their hurt feeling above the feelings of women (or anyone, really) who gets freaked out by someone walking behind them when they are walking alone.   A good percentage of men in this thread who bring up their hurt feelings are also looking for ways to mitigate the situation and make women they are walking behind more comfortable.   I for one am primarily concerned with finding ways to be less threatening.  I am not a threat, but there is no way for a stranger on the street to know that, so I want to visually minimize my ability to  be  a threat.  I understand why a woman would feel threatened by me, and I don't take it personally.   I believe all of that in my heart, but it still hurts my feelings.  I don't think that's "trivial", even if I myself believe it to be of less importance than your (or the-hypothetical-woman-walking-in-front-of-me's) fear of assault.
1	Riot said when they were changing Nid they wanted to make full AP Nid and/or AP bruiser Nidalee a viable option.   I really enjoyed AP Nidaleee's playstyle so I jumped right on that statement and started mathcrafting what I felt would help Nidalee overcome her current boring state (as AP) and weaknesses. Yes my changes are bias (I hate AD/Tank Nidalee, she's so boring and simple to play), but a bias opinion which is backed up with evidence of proper thought is better than an unbias opinion without the latter.
1	but Anivia, Ahri and Cass all have low cooldown spells, Morg is amazing if you hit that binding and can get a perfect ult, but if that binding misses you are standing around for 5 sec not able to do anything huge (other then shield your carry) while Cass can CONSTANTLY spam spells and do damage plus an Instant stun/slow, Anivia can change the map zone huge areas with her ult and has a point and click nuke every 2 sec, ahri is almost in the same as morg as in if she misses her charm there goes CC but she can still just jump in to a team and do tons of damage then jump out. Morg is an awesome mid, She farms so well and Cant really be countered but she is a high risk high reward type of teamfighter.
1	I think in theory that Mundo/WW regen being countered by Executioner's Calling is a great idea, but in theory, I don't think it works very well. I find those items aren't that great unless the enemy team is incredibly reliant on that mechanic. And then we get into item creep. What counts for mechanics like that? Displacement? Walls? Stun? Silence? Healing? Teleporting?   Because those six item slots are so powerful, you can't make an item that counters a specific game mechanic without sacrificing a major part of your power. What Graves will take Executioner's Calling over a Madred's Bloodrazer or an Infinity Edge in endgame? Or what Varus will spend the 1350g instead of almost buying a BF Sword? (I'm not saying it NEVER happens, it's just not that common, because it's a subpar choice in the long run).   Thus, Executioner's Calling should either be on par with one of those items, build into a better item (i.e. Chalice of Harmony -> Athene's, a recent item addition that I really like), or be cheap enough that it doesn't set you too far back when you decide to sell it later.   The more of those items Riot adds, the more complicated itemization becomes, drawing players toward generic cookie cutter builds and away from unique items that vary with the situation. Executioner's Calling, in my experience, needs a buff; I almost never see it used, despite Mundo's popularity. Also consider Ionic Spark, Haunting Guise, Cloak & Dagger, Tiamat . . . are these items doing anyone any good? Does their rarely-used existence improve itemization? No.
1	Bit late to the party.   We had a really bad beginning we lost pretty much all of our towers up to the inhibitor ones and then we managed to knock down there mid one which the minions kindly did for us while we were preoccupied getting pushed every lane on to our inhibitors.   Eventually after our team getting wiped in a team fight we lost our mid inhibitor then both our nexus towers and they starting smashing our nexus down then after our team respawned we managed to get an ace leaving our nexus at below half hp.   We then all rushed mid and took there mid inhibitor down. lost a few good men in a team fight in there base. the remaining people held of the enemies long enough for our nexsus's health to get brought back up to full, but to no avail they preceded to smash our nexus to pieces again to a ridiculous amount of like 20%. again we managed to kill them in our base we pushed the remaining towers and destroyed there nexus. Just shows you never to surrender a game.
0	Glad to see in your other comment you haven't jumped on the KILL ALL PITBULLS bandwagon. Sorry you had to see your dog attacked like that, and have to put up with your asshole roommate and his asshole dog.   Relevant story - I grew up with a pitbull pup from 6 years old, after previously having a whippet which got it's ass badly kicked by a German Shepherd just down the road from us. This was quite traumatic as I was very fond of the quite elderly whippet and was maybe 4 or 5 at the time.   Fast forward a few years, the owner of the German Shepherd thought it would be entertaining to rig a situation where her dog attacked our pitbull. She let it go, and only began to intervene after it was apparent her dog was getting the shock of it's life. After ours was told to get off it, let's just say it ran that far they needed a car to go find it.   I couldn't get another pitbull as they banned them in my country, in a classic piece of knee-jerk shit-media driven legislation, nowadays I have the closest thing to it. 8 years old, never been in a fight, despite several incidents of excessive provocation.
1	Well it all depends on your gameplay. Personally with Nid top I play aggressive to win my lane cause in my mind Nidalee is really good at shutting down an enemy.   Against Kennen pre lvl 6 it's tough to win harass trades cause he's always tanky and it's easy for him to land his skills. There's only 1 good moment that you have the advantage and that is if you manage to hit level 6 before he does and you jump onto him. When both have ults, you can only jump onto him if he misses his skillshots or he uses them on creeps, otherwise he lands them easily on you and combined with ulti and ignite can kill you. When he returns to lane things don't get better since he's got a revolver. Another problem with Kennen is that similar to Nidalee, he's extremely hard to gank successfully cause of his E.
1	U are only half-way right in my opinion. These are really good strats but u need experience to put them into use. If u cant make any threat on lane defensive approach is weak, and in offensive u need to know both urs and ur lane opponents dmg. learn stuff like: wave controll, putting right distance, sacrificing creeps for poke etc.  U need to know what u do rather than chosing one strategy.
1	Hey dude, I wrote a lot so sorry about that, but it's worth reading. It'll answer everything you could be wondering about, I swear. Anyway, this is advice (which is echoed throughout this thread, but not explained in this detail, as far as I saw) from a ~1650 player. Not the best, but pretty above average. I'm emphasizing the general best options for roles you play, then offering cheaper ones.   For AD:   Marks:   Armor Pen Reds (410) are the standard. They're very good. However, Flat Damage Reds (205) offer a stronger early game and barely fall off later when compared. It's easier to last hit and scales your AD abilities. A lot of people are switching over from armor pen to these.   Seals:   Flat Armor Yellows (205) are almost almost always the best. They let you live longer. Some champs might want Magic regen per 5, or maybe increased attack speed, but honestly just start with nice, cheap armor yellows. They're also the most used yellows throughout the game.   Glyphs:   Magic Resist Per Level blues (205) are normally the standard. Some people run other things like attack speed, but MR/lvl are very very good runes that are used very often.   Quints:   There are basically three options. Usually the best is Attack Damage (1025). It helps on last hitting and scales abilities. Next is Armor Pen (On sale for 775). They help later in the game, although marginally, and are normally considered inferior to the flat AD quints. The last is Movement Speed (On sale for 1550), which are normally not chosen, but are very viable quints that are good on a large variety of champions. There are some other odd ones, but the first two are almost always chosen.   AD Summary: It's pretty cheap. Optimally you'd want Armor Pen Reds, Armor Yellows, MR/Lvl Blues, and Flat Damage Quints. If you want to be cheap, buy damage reds, which is honestly not bad at all and potentially preferred (stronger early game, which is where runes matter the most). HOWEVER, since you play Jax, I STRONGLY suggest just getting the Flat AD reds. Jax runs these (they help his passive and abilities), and since they're also good on AD this is a great fit. It'll save some IP, and if you want you can always later buy the armor pen reds, but it's not a big issue honestly.   Support:   Marks:   Honestly you almost always want Flat Armor Reds (205). You generally don't need damage or penetration.   Seals:   There are several options here, and it comes down to preference. Flat Armor Yellows (205) are very good, since they let you survive in lane. Magic Regen Per Level Per 5 (205) are good on champions like Sona which run out of Mana, but TOTALLY WORTHLESS on Soraka, who you apparently like. My new favorite, however, are Gold Per 10 (410). You'll still get some armor from your reds, and getting more gold is always needed as a support. It also accelerates you to items that will help you live, such as your Heart of Gold (which, if you play Soraka, you will most likely be getting first).   Glyphs:   Blues aren't the biggest of deals for supports. One of the most standard is Magic Resist Per Level Blues (205). They're good. Help you live. Flat Cool Down Reduction (Pricey -- 820) are very good as well, especially for Soraka, who is always limited on cooldowns and doesn't run the risk of running out of mana from spamming. AP per level (410) are also decent on champions you do not fear dying to magic damage, like Soraka or Sona or Janna.   Quints:   The best are Gold Per 10 (515), hands down. Run them on everyone. The other options are Movement Speed (On Sale for 1550), which are good for initiators like Alistar/Leona, or general wardclearing presence. It's also fun to zip around the map as Janna with them. There are some odd other ones, like Health, but honestly you just want Avarice (gold per 10).   Summary for Support: Flat Armor Reds, Gold Per 10 Yellows, MR/lvl Blues, and Gold Per 10 Quints is the best bet in general. If you want to be cheaper, stick to your Flat Armor Yellows, which you will already have from your AD guys.

0	The moment you open your drink, you depressurize the bottle, and the CO2 escapes the solution as u/dhg points because there is less pressure inside the bottle to keep it there. You would need the kind of machine they use in the bottling factories to pressurize it again.
1	Destiny (Starcraft & LoL streamer) was asked to move from Twitch to Own3d and promised a bunch of stuff. Like 8 months later the promises had not been fully lived up to by Own3d, not to mention they did not pay him what he was supposed to be paid for AND they are way behind on their payments too. That is the gist of it, there is some stuff about Own3d withholding final payment because Destiny left 2 weeks early but as much as it sucks the reasoning behind that seems legit.
1	Well, I only have about 350 normals played and about ~55 ranked played (currently silver 3), but I queue with my high gold and plat friends who acknowledge that I am playing well above my current division.   I think one of the best things I've ever does is watch streamers, but not as a source of entertainment, but as a learning tool. They have learned to play at an incredible level passively, something that would require a plat player to focus extremely hard on, and something that a bronze player could never do. Learning every detail of how they lane makes for an almost unbeatable laning phase. As far as team fight knowledge goes, it's all about knowing what your champion can do. If you are playing Nidalee being the forefront of a team fight is not going to win you the game, but staying back and poking will, while the opposite is true for Nasus. Identifying what you are poor at and working on that will also result in you being an overall better player. Practice CS. 100 by 15 is pretty good, 150 but 20 is even better. Never, ever, ever rage. Getting to silver is pretty easy if you just make sure you are playing to the best of your ability. If you have been in bronze a long time then you are likely not capable of carrying, so just focus on being good yourself and not losing your lane. The key to Season 3 right now is snowballing, so getting ganks from your jungler and capitalizing on the enemies mistakes will grant you a victory.   Oh and don't get greedy. You will die.
0	Yeah, I'd say there are more bible thumpers who get offended by "happy holidays" than there are non Christians who get offended when they hear "Merry Christmas"
0	i agree with you on the accepting of different musical tastes, but i disagree with your other points.   Chris Brown only got off jailtime because he was Chris Brown. If it was a normal man, he would have been sent to jail for assault and other legal charges i don't know.   Secondly, i don't really think they have musical talent. Yes they are good dancers, but they are musicians, not dancers, and i hate how the talent has been taken out of music. It's all about your image and less about your music. All they do is get some producer to write you a basic song about partying or a girl, run it through autotune and wallah! number 1 hit.   Look at people like lady gaga and katy perry etc., songs are generic and bland, but they dress like spastics and people think they are hot, so they are famous. Wonderful singer like Adele, accused of being too big. I'm sorry, at what point did her figure have anything to do with her music?
1	Actually there are male specific genetic disorders (called X-linked traits), like a certain form of hemophilia in Spanish royalty.  The way they work is some genes follow Mendel's rule of dominance, where only one of the two heterozygous genes codes actually does anything if one is dominant and one is recessive. (Remember, there are countless exceptions to this rule.) Colorblindness can be X-linked (emphasis on can), and when a trait is X-linked it is recessive, and belongs to the 22nd chromosome where if they are a girl, they have another dominant X (from the father). The other X from the father is dominant, thus canceling the recessive colorblindness. However, if you are a boy, you inherit a Y chromosome. This Y chromosome is unable to dominate the recessive X colorblindness, so the boy will be colorblind.
1	I really think people need to calm down calling this change a horrible/stupid mistake on riot's end. I feel this is a change that will work out better in the long run.   Honestly, they want to make the game less farm oriented for laners but more about having choices. I wanna see more people roaming and getting kills and taking advantage of that AFK farming Karthus/Anivia/Zyra. I hate seeing pure farm lanes.   This will also allow more interaction between the lanes and greater emphasis on dragon control, and with a lot of the new jungler items we could see a lot more crazy things coming out from teams b/c of a change in gold income for laners.
1	I know exactly how you feel. As soon as I saw that there was Ahri changes that Riot was implementing I was instantly worried. When I Read over the changes I was somewhere in high Gold by memory. I played Ahri as a sustained damage mage. NOT as a burster champion. I always built items such as Rylai's Crystal Scepter and Rabadon's instead of rushing a Deathfire Grasp that would be expected on Ahri. This strategy of sustained damage mage works through Gold, somewhat in Platinum, and not so much in Diamond. My win rate in Season 3 with Ahri was 57%. Now, in Season 4 it is 53.3%, a drop of 3.5% which is very significant over 600 ranked games (about 22 wins, a total of around 430 LP) Due to the changes to Ahri (Making her more of, quote Riot: "Kiss of death burst Ahri") I didn't adjust at all, I continued playing the same build, just played her mechanically differently. I am now trying to purchase Deathfire Grasp and more "meta" items on Ahri but it just isn't working. I am not good enough at that mechanic of Charm+Deathfire -> Combo. I haven't put much effort towards practicing it. A 53.3% win rate on Ahri is still superb, while not as good as it was 8+ months ago I am still good with her and she is still a viable pick for me in the mid lane.   As for counter picks to her such as Ziggs and LeBlanc it's very difficult, I know. Normally LeBlanc is banned at my ELO and I just go farm lane with Ziggs. My Ahri playstyle is  very  passive and revolves around farming. I am now also trying out purchasing a Chalice of Harmony as my first back instead of just building what ever I can afford for lane sustain. I have not changed my build or playstyle since Bronze, it still works but not as well. I am nearly  too  accustomed to my current playstyle and I am finding it difficult to change to the current meta.
1	I think you have a skewed idea of what tanks are though. The idea behind a tank is that they go in first and soak up damage while your dps and support do work behind you. There isn't a utility requirement for someone to be called a tank. Typically a bruiser is someone who sits in between being a tank and a squishy, being able to output a fair amount of damage but still being quite healthy.
1	From what I heard when the Riot employee was on State of the League it sounded like every country could follow their own rules. This is because of the difference in scale in different countries, some might have dozens of great teams others only a couple of decent ones,  as well as whether or not the WCG finals were held online or at a LAN.   Going beyond what happened in the US the answer is no, despite what they have said about doing it this was to keep it similar to what was done in Canada there is nothing that indicates that anything like a second finals match will be happening in other countries.   As for what happened in Canada I understand it as they WOULD have played a second set of games had the team from the losers bracket won the first set of games in the final so I assume the winners bracket team simply won the first set of games and therefore won the match without the need for the second set of games. I did however not see the canadian finals so I dont know if this was actually the case.
0	In Vietnam I was drinking with a Canadian guy from my hostel who had this happen to the night before. A group of tranny hookers had taken his wallet, removed the cash and put it back in his pants. Saw him again the next day and found out after we split up the night before he ran into the group that had nicked his cash. He went apeshit and got in a massive punch up with 4 tranny hookers where he also smashed the hell out of one their scooters. After the fight he found out that during the brawl they stole his wallet, stole the cash and put his wallet back.
1	You arent lucky. See bronze is messed up. The people in bronze are sick of being in bronze so they...ok we, have mostly stopped flaming and started trying to be good teammates. Sure our gameplay is weaker but everytime someones flaming and my team starts to mediate, I lolking the flamer and (big shocker here) they're silver V-silver III nine out of ten times.
1	No, you're approaching this with the wrong attitude. You think normals don't matter, your teammate does. But the fact is, neither of you is right. You both need to accept that other players have different expectations.   In this case, the person who says in chat that "its just normals" is in the wrong, because they are intentionally provoking the other person into getting angry. If you didnt say "it's just normals", they can't rage at you for it. (They might rage at your for something else, but at least you're not arming them). And besides, what's the point of saying that you don't care? Do you think you get virtual cool points for not caring? (Sadly, you don't)
1	Agree on the princes teacup party, I also stated somewhere else people are keen to report you for everything. For example: Bot lane gets a fail gank or something that happens to mid, they argue and keep going on. Then Bot lane suddenly die at dragon pit (no dragon ~ no reason to be there) after they died, they (at least the adc did) started blaming Fiddle again. I stated that Fiddle has nothing to do with it, and then he said 'ignored'. This person may have or not have reported me after the game, propably not because we won that game.  I'm almost certain every game has 1-2 reports from the losing team.
0	We're equally confused by it. Also, ever year towards the end of summer we put all of our summer stuff on 75% off clearance rather than just sending it to a warehouse for storage until next summer. Grills, hammocks, patio furniture, beach stuff. All to make room for the Back to School stuff. Then we clearance the back to school stuff to make room for Halloween stuff. Then The Halloween stuff for Christmas, Then Christmas for Valentines Day, Then Valentines Day for Easter. THEN, we set up the summer stuff again. And they're the exact god damned items we celaranced out 9 months ago, only at full price again. Very few new items. Ever year I buy a new hammock for $30 and it's the exact same one as last year.
1	Lol, ReginaId is already the 임요환 of LoL. Do you think 임요환 was the only person to revolutionize Brood War?   I agree with part of what you're saying in that the constant changes and updates to the game is hurting its evolution as both a casual strategy game and an E-sport, and that the game's strategy will naturally evolve without Riot's 'help'.   What you're forgetting is the limitations of Solo Queue and Arranged. Of course you have to follow the metagame in Solo Queue, you can't just tell your team to have 2 junglers and an AD solo bot lane, they will have no clue how to do it, and will think you're just trolling and wont listen to you in general.   In Arranged though, there are less limitations. M5 has already sent Urgot solo bot, with Lee Sin and Alistar double jungle, and of course it worked. The meta game has a lot of counters like this, and those counters have counters. Its both the fault of the pro gamers for not thinking past the solo queue mentality which doesn't apply in arranged (we have to follow the meta!), and Riot's fault for constantly changing the game (When someone discovers something new, Riot nerfs it before people discover how to counter it, and the game doesn't progress, it just goes back to how it was).   The strategies in Brood War have changed A LOT over the years with hardly any patches, because the player's will learn how to counter the counters, and how to counter the counter's counters, etc. And less patches LoL would help that happen to it as well, but as I said above, it is also the player's fault (Keep in mind that LoL is a 5v5 game, not a 1v1 game, so it is a lot harder to innovate. M5 has been doing this the best, which is why they're so dominate in tournaments)   Also, LoL constantly patching when each team has 3 bans is ridiculous.
1	Fun, but true story. A friend of mine was stuck in bronze I/II, but he was part of our ranked team, which we were going to play LAN tournaments with, so he started playing with us and ever since he did he started climbing the ladder, he's now gold V on his promotion to gold IV and surpassed every one of us within 2 months.
1	I was in a normals game today that my team ended up winning (late game ryze/renekton vs. squishies gg wp).   We had a guy who chose Ezreal (you can see where this goes lol) and proceeded to start out 1-6 bot with Sona. Top lane gets turret down early, but Caitlyn has bloodthirster at 15 minutes. So needless to say Sona was a bit salty.   The kid apologizes and says it's his first time playing Ezreal. This is where I think things get tricky for me as a player, because although I am very polite and deferential and make conscious efforts to come across as such (seasoned by spending most of high school getting abused and abusing on people in Halo/CoD), I am nonetheless very competitive and want my record to reflect my ability. MOBA's are different than any other genre, I think, because it's not just a 5 or 10 minute splash like shooting games or even a half-hour slog like FIFA or Madden where you're the only person to blame. There's something very Tantalesque about a slightly inferior or even overmatched opponent slowly bleeding you to death because he's fed, not necessarily better. That can be maddening.   Personally I would  never  tell a person to kill themselves (which happened in this game from Zed and Sona, they were pretty brutal). But it's certainly frustrating, and given that my previous games (yoloQ obvs) featured a duo that  demanded  top and went 4-24 and a first time Aatrox that went 1-18 before that...I was noticeably annoyed to say the least.   It is one thing for a new player to have a bad game as Garen, or Tryndamere, or even  nope not Renekton because he drives a chevrolet movie theatre  Ashe; especially if you've been forced into a role you're not comfortable or accustomed to playing. But IIRC the kid called bot in pregame, asked who he should be (cycling between Mundo and another tanky champ), being told "not Ezreal unless main" and still choosing Ez. This isn't level 3, it's ~20, so even though it's normal I feel as if you should generally understand that if you get killed three times in a row it's either time to hug turret or switch lanes.   It's hard, man. I know when I flip on BlackOps II that I'm going to learn a lot about my mom's proclivities for prepubescent testicles. LoL shouldn't be like that, I feel as if we have a responsibility as a community to discourage and call out behavior like that, but there will always be those who invest a lot of emotion and lash out way more negatively than is necessary for any MOBA, just like there will always be those who invest a lot of emotion and take things far more seriously than should be warranted by a stranger on YoloQ on the internet in a game featuring humanoid arena fighters.   I remember mid not calling out MIA twice in a row a few games back; the third time i survived but I typed "mid come on you have to let us know MIA we're getting destroyed up here." I'd notified the first time, got a "sorry", the second time got a "my bad". It's frustrating, especially when your team is better overall.
0	As a male, i can't comment with any authority here, but I'll give my $0.02. I think for a lot of them, the mere act of exposing themselves in public is a turn on. It is simply a modern day act of exhibitionism, which is a fetish that quite a lot of people have. It doesn't necessarily have to be the result of low self-esteem or daddy issues as many suggest, just simply a means by which they achieve arousal. Sure it's more dangerous, because many more people are able to view/archive the exposure and that can create problems in the future, but to some that is where the arousal comes into play.   So what if it is for attention? That doesn't make them any different than the rest of us who seek attention by means of other, more socially acceptable, avenues such as buying the hottest clothing or the sexiest tech or vehicles in order to attract others. I'm not saying it's a healthy habit, just pointing out that at it's core it isn't abnormal or necessarily indicative of a messed up life.
0	That's called the
1	he just explained it?   I like comedy/action movies, you could like horror, someone else romance, etc. It's about personal preference. What I like is not necessarily something you like. I find PL funny and entertaining, doesn't mean you have to. He's just an entertainer, and you're entitled to not like his form of entertainment, just don't expect others to feel the same way you do (read: if you don't like his stuff, you don't have to bother looking at it).
0	Please don't condescend to me. I'm fully aware that not everyone supports everything that feminism does, because I am one of those people. I despise tumblr feminists, radfems, and SRS for the very reason that they preach hatred, not love, and female superiority over gender equality. I do not see "small critiques of feminism" and flip out over them, I see things like /r/theredpill, and the idea of "alpha culture".   It's not even like I don't find those things funny, in a twisted way, it's just that it's all so hypocritical. Racism is UNIVERSALLY shot down, but sexism isn't, against women AND against men, and it's irritating to see those brave supporters of liberal progress and equality scoff at the notion of women's rights, as though the problem no longer exists.   I'd like to point out that there are serious men's rights issues, and I agree that feminism does not stress them hard enough (or at all), but the men's rights movement has an unfortunate concentrated percentage of neckbeards who believe women are evil, much as SRS has a huge percentage of shitladies and radfems who think all men are rapists.
1	This could be the greatest thing to ever happen to you.   You have so much talent when it comes to this game and, if you practice your face off, you could be a potential pro player or at least on a challenger team. However, all of the shit you have stirred up in the community over the past few months with the boosting, the bitching, and the questionable stream content has made a lot of people lose faith in you. Now, and rightly so, you are banned from playing this game on the aforementioned accounts.   Use this banning as a way to start fresh. Make a new account, get it to 30, buy some champs, and push diamond/challenger like you've done so many times. None of this is hard for you, and I think if you just started fresh and cleaned your reputation off a little bit on both streams and on forums, you could be a great addition to the community.
0	but you get step by step instructions. hell, i got instructions on how to make moonshine in AP Chem. it was an example of limiting reagent problems.
1	Everyone is familiar with the Dunning-Kruger effect.   A lot of the time people complain because while they make mistakes, and even acknowledge it, there are games where the teammate(s) in question perform at a level significantly lower than that of which they are expected to.   Everyone makes mistakes, and most people know that. But there are lots of circumstances where you can, in fact, blame your team for a loss. Here's the thing, no one is perfect, and no one has "perfect games" there are literally always things you could do to have played it better. By that logic, we can say that the frequency of mistakes tends to lessen, but never go away, as you progress through the ranks. Now, with that in mind, who's to say that you may make mistakes, but not nearly to the same frequency as whomever you are playing with? When you play at a level that is higher, but albeit marginally, than those you are matched with, then your teammates can in fact hold you back.
1	I mean, Ahri basically spends the whole video running (is she oom? lol) and doesn't even carry/summon her orb until she oneshots Zyra (really)   cd? oom?   and also the cinematic try to be more "realistic", thats why champions keep geting 1 shoted.   how hard is it to understand?   >  Near the end Rengar comes out of stealth and just keeps staring at Darius for no reason.   again, a more realistic aprouch with a touch of drama. You know, a cinematic is not a replic of what you do on SR. It woulndt be fun at all to see a cinematic of draven AA all day long...   > Draven manages to miss an auto attack.   realistic touch...
1	Whether he was going to kill himself or not is definitely not the question to be asked.   If he wasn't going to, close-to-no harm was done by saying you "How's wasting your life on League saving your life?", and there really wouldn't be much of a problem.   If he however was on the verge of killing himself, suicidal thoughts, even just being depressed, then encouraging him is always a good way to help someone.  Saying what you did, on the other hand, would probably make him kind of sad, and depending on his state of mind, he might go back to the previous stages.   source: Depression and mental illness within my own and girlfriends family.
0	Funny story, I was driving back from a Lions/Bills game and we cut through canada to get back quicker. (I live in Western NY) I had my cruise set probably 7 or 8 kmph over the limit, suddenly a pack of cards. I went in the left lane to pass everyone and one car followed me.  Then I saw him. A cop leading the pack. I was like shoot here comes a tickets. I merged back into the right lane in front of the cop and the guy behind me flew past, the cop turned his lights on and got the other guy.
0	I had the same thought until my grandma told me something that shook me. My mom had me, my dad was a jerk. She met my stepdad. They have my brother. My stepdad is a complete ass to me. I never felt accepted at all.  My mom was afraid that no one else would want her because she already had kids.  So she stayed with the father of my brother and sister. I can tolerate him now, but growing up not so much.
0	As a professional mechanic, don't do that.   Batteries being charged, or batteries being discharged with high current loads generate HYDROGEN GAS. They also get hot. It's not uncommon for batteries in bad condition (usually necessitating a jump in the first place) TO BOIL THE BATTERY ACID WHILE BEING JUMPED. This also releases large quantities of very flammable hydrogen gas. The boiling battery acid can also rupture the cell walls of the battery, spraying.. boiling acid everywhere. Igniting hydrogen gas from the battery can have a similar scenario occur.   Now, as far as striking jumper cables together. DON'T. Don't fucking do it. Depending on what vehicle you drive, varying things can happen. If you drive an old 80's-90's truck, it shouldn't be too much of a problem, worse that will happen is you'll kill the output diodes on the alt (new alternator- fixed). On newer vehicles with ECU controlled voltage regulators, modules up the ass, etc.. not a good idea.   In electronics, when you try actuating a relay from a microcontroller, you have to put a diode between the legs of the coil on the relay. When you turn on the relay, nothing bad happens. When you turn power off, the coil acts like an inductor (fighting change) and you get a backwards flowing high voltage spike that fries things.   Guess what else is an inductor? If you said the windings and rotor of your alternator, several feet of twisted wire jumper cables, and the miles of wire inside your vehicle, you'd be right. By shorting the jumper cables together, all the current the battery is making, along with all the power the alt can put out (in that amount of rise-time, and alternator rpm (most alts don't put out full power to 1,800 engine rpm)) into the cables. Then you break the short circuit, that is when sparks fly. Not only are you shutting power off to your vehicle quickly and repeatedly by short circuiting the battery and charging system, you're back feeding emf.   Usually the battery is used to filter stray high voltage spikes, from everything including the alternator, high-current drain devices like large electric fans, air conditioning motors, sunroof motors, on-board air compressors for luxury cars/trucks, etc. The battery is actually quite a good snubber, acting somewhere in between a capacitor and an inductive load, filtering spikes from the alternator caused when various items turn on and off, as well as plain filtering 'dirty' dc from alternators.   I just realized I wrote a novel.
1	It's kind of a bug, yet not. What they did with E, a good while ago, was that after you use your E it makes sure you hit the enemy after (the same way they did it with Akali R - for consistency) - However, pressing Q mid-air resets the already given command; Which means your next AA will come out slightly later if you don't remember to give it the command mid-push
1	Top and mid usually play alone for half of the game, so utility would be a bit wasted on them; they prefer more power in 1v1/1v2/2v1/2v2 fights. Adc is adc and usually doesn't provide much utility to the team (but that's ok, they are the main dps). Supports are specialized in keeping just their adc safe, so it's usually the jungler who has to keep the enemy crowd controlled for the mid to get some good aoe damage off, the assassin to sneak around, the bruiser to unleah some aoe damage, the tank to get focused, ...   I'd say about 2/3 of the champions can survive in the jungle and gank somehow... I've jungled with stuff like heimer and leona. It's just that most picks are extremely situational, you won't do much with Heimer if your lanes can't provide the needed cc to get some turret damage off, and you won't do much with leona if your lanes can't provide the needed damage while you cc them. I haven't played against a Yasuo jungle as laner yet, but I guess his cc isn't that strong, and chasing with redbuff usually doesn't work unless the laner crazily overextended (you would get another wave of cc ready with a cc jungler then, too).   Lategame (or teamfight time), you will lack cc and lose the game. This is why I don't play my Quadkill Uebear in ranked... 1.75 sec aoe stun, 70% 2sec multitarget slow and single target knockup (flair) is much more effective/safe than relying on snowball (which I definitely get with Voli... bear too strong).
1	About two years ago now I played quite a bit of Wukong top. The key is understanding how to  Survive  in lane. In my opinion, Wukong doesn't make very good trades until level 4, and his mana pool doesn't allow him to make more than a couple ability rotations before he goes oom.  In the early phases of the lane, you should focus on farming while taking as little damage and using as little mana as possible. If you need to miss a few CS to avoid taking 100+ free damage, it's worth the loss. If you're able to take advantage of his immense power spike between levels 4-6 (and Especially 6) to get an early kill, the amount of snowballing he's able to do more than makes up for some lost cs.   Tips :  -Flask/Cloth 5pots are underrated starting item sets for Wukong. Being able to stay in lane for 2+ extra waves is more valuable than damage from Dorans/Long sword  -You don't need to Clone every time you go in to avoid taking damage. Mana is damage, and odds are you're against someone who deals AoE damage anyway, and your clone is a waste of mana if you're going to be taking damage regardless.  -Use the bush to your advantage. If the enemy gets too close, walk up to them and Auto - Q - E them for maximum damage.  -Trinity Force is an extremely efficient item for Wukong to rush. Wukong is all about BURST damage, and the items you build for Trinity force give you wonderful trading power (which is everything in the lane).  -If you're against a heavy AD team, Sunfire cape has great synergy with your ultimate, and Randuins Omen makes you virtually unkillable/inescapable in team fights when combined with your passive.  -You don't need Black Cleaver AND Last Whisper to kill an enemy carry in 1 rotation (especially since your Q already has armor pen on it), building Tankier items like Maw of Malmortius and Sunfire Cape will allow you to survive in team fights longer. The longer you're alive, the longer you can keep bashing the enemy teams face.  -I often wait until I'm AT LEAST level 9 before I really start putting damage on the enemy turret if I intend to roam at all. Otherwise, feel free to take the turret asap and keep pressuring top (safely of course, if your team isn't in position to take an objective while you're getting ganked, you'll most likely have just given the enemy team a free kill. Give your team some time to group onto a turret / dragon before extending too far for the next turret if you choose to split push the entire game).
1	Karma's rework is a bit odd. A couple friends of mine are crying OP on her. (Shield that scales pretty well with AP)   The Mantra bonuses are crazy giving Karma interesting tools to surprise her opponents. When she mantra's they don't know is a massive AOE shield + DMG coming, A ninja 25% max health heal on W, or an empowered Q where the already decently based stat AOE Q gets an additional burst on the initial hit AND the AOE after.   Imo Karma is a farm support mage. Stick her mid and she doesn't have much kill potential, but she can farm waves with her Q like crazy. Come late game when her cool downs are pretty low she'll be supporting her team like crazy while dealing decent magic damage.
0	Here's a twist:   My father was a overweight man for most of my life. Six years ago he was diagnosed with ALS. In the early stages he was able to get around without a cane, but obviously couldn't make it very far without becoming exhausted. On a visit to New York for a experimental drug trial, he and his friend stopped at a Walmart in Pennsylvania. He didn't want to wait in the car so he went inside and grabbed a scooter so he could keep up with his friend.   Then here comes a Walmart employee who proceeded to berate him for taking a scooter, even going as far as cursing at him, calling him fat, lazy and other horrible names.   When he returned home he was clearly shaken up by it. I was so enraged I wanted to get in my car and drive to Pennsylvania to kick that guy's ass.   R.I.P. Dad. It's been two weeks as of yesterday and I miss you more and more each passing day.
1	There is a five million dollar prize pool and they don't have the money for something is not a very good argument.   I can't understand what in my post makes me hate riot.  Why can't I be annoyed that the servers are down twice for the same patch in a week without being labeled as a spoiled child by most of the community?  I'm not enraged at riot. I am concerned, but perhaps that is because for me this game  isn't  free.   But please, stop confusing what are legitimate complaints about about a company's product as whining and pettiness only because their business model is different from World of Warcraft.
1	You are right and I should have clarified my point/stance a bit more. All I was trying to say was that what the casters said was stereotyping and not racism. However stereotyping in a professional setting is still wrong and should never be done. While ESports is more lax that other forms of professional competitions those types of statements are unprofessional. It would be like a professional football caster saying that one team had the advantage simply because they had more black people. Even if these things are said jokingly and in a lighthearted way they still come off as unprofessional.
1	A correct modifier of the above survey would be the proportion of LoLers to redditors, based on gender. If you have 100 males and 100 females in LoL, but only 50 LoL male redditors and 10 LoL female redditors, then the modifier would be 5:1. Since reddit as a whole has about a 59% male base, let us assume - since we lack any better statistic specific to the LoL subreddit - that a simple modifier of 59:41. Or in other words, multiply the female ratio by 59, and the male by 41. Currently it is about 9:1; this mild variation would bring us to 6.25:1; or ~86.2% male, and ~13.7% female. If you wanted to be more pedantic, you could also modify the likelihood of females to respond, as to males, or even the propensity of female to lie, as to males. The subsequent accuracies, however, would probably not change too much.
1	Yep, they wouldn't listen. It was sad.   Especially the fucking Blakinola
1	In my personal opinion, as being self appointed leader, Regi needs to take some courses in team work and leadership, and also management. This would help the entire team out greatly, Regi the most.   Being able to correctly articulate his points in a manner that wouldn't set the other players on edge would be a huge advantage the their team, as he's maiming their progress greatly right now.   A leader should adapt his style depending on which member of the team he is dealing with and how they prefer work, not the other way around.   Arguing isn't helping at all and is a useless exercise that puts every single member of the team on tilt.
1	There was one game where we tower dove an Annie bot lane with our jungler and I died as I killed her. All she said after I died was, "worth it?" After that, every time someone on our team killed her they'd type in /all, "worth it?" It got under her skin really quick because she'd always stay in the front, make bad flash stuns, and never look at her minimap when we'd come after her in-lane.
1	So HotshotGG. I want to say, I am not a viewer of yours. Part of that is a perception of your attitude.   Your statements and the value you seem to put in your fans has me reconsidering things. I intend to give your stream another longer try.
1	While many points in the walloftext.jpg are valid, and while I agree with you that an advertised Q&A should be more professional, the condescending nature of your post does not quite stir understanding. If a member of TSM were to see this post, rather than learning for next time and hoping to live up to expectations, they would focus on your consistent blunt negativity. ie. "Get the dog and the girls out of there, iirc it was tSM Q&A time. Not TSM hangs around the house time. That's what your vlogs are for." In that statement, you not only speak down to the team as if you were their mother, you also harshly put down the value of their vlogs, which they take the time out of their day to record so you can feel more involved in the now of their lives.   While certain members of TSM could be seen as uncaring or rude, Reginald (work on it, friend), you have to remember that even as our idols, they are still human. You can't expect to have positive results through brutal scolding. However, one thing I did think was a good segment of your post, was the "pointers" (see condescending above). You brought up ways they can make the next Q&A, if they do another with responses like yours, better for viewers. Going back to how TSM are but human beings, you also have to remember that they are, in essence, entertainers. While many people did not get their questions answered, they may have gotten something else: a smile, a chuckle, a funny link to Chaox drunk, singing Eye of the Tiger. In order to be entertained, you must be willing to be entertained.
1	Fuck yes. Buckle up bitches because here comes a rant about the Jungle Cunt from yours truly. So Let's start with my main issues with Nidalee 1- You can't catch and/or kill the bitch. It does not matter what you do, if you do not lock her down or literally 1 shot her, she will get away and I can fucking promise you that much. 2- Her damage can only be described by the word "disgusting" It is not balanced in any meaning of the word and we will go further into this shortly. 3- This bitch is ungankable. I thought I hated her when I played top lane. No. Fuck that, if there is a Jungle Cunt top lane, you might as well fucking forget that it exists because there is no way a kill is going down. "But Number1lion, what about if you have a Nidalee on your team?" Literally the exact same thing. Nidalee is useless when ganking for her, even if you do a perfect gank, you will not get her or yourself a kill. 0 CC = why the fuck are you helping top lane. 4- This bitch takes 0. Fucking. Skill. People like to bitch about a lot of champions, they like to say that Ryze is easy, that Blitzcrank takes little skill. Let me introduce your bitch ass to Nidalee- the champ that actually takes negative skill. This champ will make a bronze 5 player look good. Why? Because Her kit is fucking stupid and meant to be easy to win with. Q- Fuck this shit. "We're going to give her a 1500 range skillshot nuke on a 3.6 second cooldown that does 450+ 120% AP at max range."-Riot Are you fucking kidding me? That is insane. "But Number1lion, it's a small skillshot and it is hard to hit!" You know what? If this is how you defend Nidalee get the fuck out. The spell is on a 3.6 SECOND COOLDOWN. WHO THE FUCK CARES IF IT'S HARD TO HIT. IF YOU FIRE ABOUT 15 OF THEM PRIOR TOO/DURING A TEAMFIGHT IT DOES NOT MATTER IF IT IS HARD TO HIT. YOU ONLY NEED TO HIT 1 OUT OF 15 TO FUCKING SLAUGHTER AN ADC/MAGE/SUPPORT/ANYONE BUT FUCKING GALIO. Honest to god I hate this spell in Human mode, I hate how people that main this champ defend it, and I fucking hate the damage it does. Q-Cougar mode- +75 Range, about a 3 second cooldown ( I don't care to do the math exactly), MAGIC DAMAGE, dual scaling, and a fucking execute. This does stupid fucking damage at level 1. I'll even explain how your level 1 trade with Nidabitch will play out. 1- She hits a Q in human mode. 2- She Transforms, and does about half of your health thanks to the 33% bonus from Hunt. It doesn't matter if this bitch is going AP or AD, thanks to the rework of the century she scales with both and it hurts like a bitch from both. People bitched about Darius' level 1 damage. LOOK AT THIS BITCH. JUST FUCKING LOOK AT HER DAMAGE. THIS MAKES OLD DARIUS LOOK LIKE A LITTLE GIRL. ( Not Annie) W- Oh this shit. No fuck this shit. It's not enough that she get's 10% MS when walking through a brush, no, she also needs an ENDLESS SUPPLY OF WARDS. This is on a 13 second CDR at lvl 1 and if going full CDR will be 5.4 seconds at level 5. I probably wouldn't mind this ability so much if it didn't do fucking insane damage. This shit does 100+18%(+2% per 100 AP) of your CURRENT HEALTH if you step on this. This is not some little wooden trap. THIS SHIT IS A NUCLEAR BOMB IN TRAP FORM. This shit will make your champ need a fucking wheelchair if you step on this shit. Oh and then she get's vision of you for 4 seconds as if the damage wasn't enough. W-Cougar mode. Fuck. This. Spell. I hate this. This makes me angry to see. I hate it so fucking much. 375 range Jump on a 3 second CDR. She can jump over walls, she can jump from bush to bush, she can dodge shit, she can weave shit, she can't be ganked. A Nid that isn't silenced is basically playing League on God mode if she is not silenced/stunned/dead. I won't even get into the fact that it DOUBLES IN RANGE IF YOU ARE HUNTED. 7-fucking-50 range on a 3 second CDR. Good fucking luck getting away skippy. This bitch is going to send you straight to hell. E- 205+ 50% AP Heal. Oh, and as if giving a non-support champ an insane, point and click, 7.2 second CDR heal wasn't enough, it also gives 60% attackspeed for 7 seconds. Yeah, you read that right. 1800g worth of value on a 7.2 second CDR. This mean's that an ADC effectively has 1800g worth of stats for free as soon as this spell is maxed. Are you fucking kidding me? WW was nerfed because his W gave 40% to teammates. This shit is disgusting and makes trading her pointless. This is a commonly said thing when playing against Nid " Oh yeah I actually somehow managed to out trade her, even with her bullshit damag....and she is back to full health." Get ready to lose every fucking trade you make with her because this heal is absolute bullshit and make's the worst players look like a fucking lvl99 priest up in this bitch. E-Cougar. At first I didn't have an issue with this spell; 3 second CDR, 300 range, fairly balanced damage at all ranks, and a 45% scaling. But then I thought about it. This bitch has everything, poke, attackspeed, heal, wards, mobility, damage, AND THEN YOU GIVE HER WAVE CLEAR?! Imagine Vayne with a never ending trinket, a free heal, and a Sivir Q on her kit. This spell, while balanced as a whole imo, is bullshit because of what it does to her as a champ. Now she is not limited to staying in teamfights. She splitpushes faster than a goddamn Nasus. This spell effectively makes her the best at fucking anything she wants to do. Splitpush Nid? Fuck yeah go for it man, not like anyone will catch you thanks to your 10000 wards on the map or the insane movement speed. Mage/poke Nid? Dude go and poke the fuck out of anyone you want. Who cares if you miss 90% of your spears. Hit one and you win the teamfight. Brawler Nid? Your bullshit Cougar Q makes you a god of trading anyone with Hunt on them, so go eat a goddamn ADC up if you want too. R- W/e being able to choose melee or range is always stupid and makes every champ that has it counter fun to lane against. Literally every one who has it is not a fun matchup ever.
1	Lucky, only have about 30 lol. And anytime! I wasn't sure if you were new or anything so that was the only thing I could suggest. Also if you find Cass kinda boring then I wouldn't get her. Because in the end (sounds lame and cliche) it is a game. It is a break from life, something that is supposed to let you relax (even though raging is involved in this game a lot) and have fun! Fun is always the main reason for the reason video games were made. Never forget that.
1	Well the "admin" is like 20 years old, and he throws rages all the time and slurs. Very unprofessional and inconsistent on many different aspects. This league is run like a circus for ticks with no actual organization.   The owners/players i've met so far are pretty decent human beings, but kubz91 who is the admin is just trying to do this for a quick buck. He doesn't care how well the games are but if he can get some suckers to pay him to play he will be one happy camper.   Tonight he banned a player for playing taric top in an ALL STAR game. This is possibly the worst 'league' recreation i have ever seen. Nothing is good about this league.   My owner is a nice guy but he changed my schedule 3 times in 2 weeks without telling me and im a "starter" but only played 2 games. This league is pretty much just annoying and pointless. Nothing is going to be done in this league, move along. I think all of the all star players are quitting tonight pretty much along with a couple of extras.
1	I posted this before in an older Whose League post, but I think it got buried.   Travis, you should consider changing the SotL formula, since it's not going anywhere it seems. I think the biggest issue is the length of the show, 2 hours are great and I like it, but I have the luxery of watching the VODs when I have the time. But pro players have to be there on time to record it. 2 hours probably interferes with their scrimming/RL stuff too much. Perhaps a 1 hour show would be less impactful on their schedule. Or make short segments with different pros for each one, maybe it'll be easier grabbing a few pros for 30 mins at a time.   I don't know whether or not you will be able to assemble a crew for this week, but if not, it's another week in a long streak without SotL. Pros may not have the time, or just don't want to sit through a 2 hour session.
1	Level 1 invades are honestly one of the things I enjoy most about watching league.   The absolute highest level of play with insane coordination.  Any team can stand on the "line of scrimmage" and monitor invades but if you watch Korea(more so in S3 or even eu) early invades were so exciting.  You actually hold your breath wondering if they are going to facecheck into that bush or blind hook/shen taunt etc.   I think that the whole lvl 1 kill = gg sucks but if they put a mechanic in to have a window of time to even up the gold after a first blood or something it would be great.  Maybe put a debuff on whoever gets first blood making them worth some more gold for a period of time after first blood?  It would be cool to have casters focus on say the mid laner after since he has a 5 minute debuff or something wondering if/when the other team is going to try and make a play on them.
0	Rescue sites are always posting this on Facebook and everyone's all like "Who would DO that to an animal?! That's just cruel!!" As someone who grew up with huskies, this really irks me. I think it's really important to understand the difference between different breeds of dogs.   Someone called the Humane Society because, one time, my dad was out and the dog was outside (where he wanted to be). And it was -1 degree Celsius out. I'm not even exaggerating. I remember seeing people with light jackets on. And the Humane Society actually warned my dad that, next time the dog is left outside, they'd take him and put him down (I'm assuming because he was so old??) This REALLY scared me that the HUMANE SOCIETY didn't even understand the difference between huskies and...I don't know...maybe a chihuahua? (It wasn't even too cold for people!)   Eventually, my dad was able to meet up with an agent from the Humane Society who had actually spent time up north and had seen huskies in their natural habitat. He said the dog was fine, but just suggested having a place the dog could go for shelter (like a dog house (which was in the backyard, but the dog generally preferred the front) with a straw mat).
1	I still don't get a few things about the system:   Each tier is divided into leagues of 250, and then into Divisions of 50 each, right. Does that mean that we can only go against those 49 other players in our division when we play ranked? Or who is it that we actually verse, cause to me it seems like theres hardly anyone who we will be matched against.   Also, is there any difference between, say, Gold League 1, Division 1 and Gold League 2, Division 1? Are all leagues equal, since I don't think he talked about moving between leagues.. only up and down divisions and then tiers.   Just a little confused.. since there doesn't seem to be any reason to me that the leagues do anything.. why not just have it as 5 divisions within a tier, and you have to go up the divisions then up the tier..
1	Ok well I've been programming for many years and here's how it works:   First of all, they always tell beginner programmers that global variables are bad because if you suck at programming you'll abuse them and screw it up. On top of that, using 'local' variables teaches you about scope, which is something that you don't learn if you only use globals. So it would make sense that they taught you that, giving you a completely incorrect view of their usage, for your own good. Keep this in mind when trying to teach people things on the internet in the future :)   Second of all, in c++ there is a thing called a pre-processor directive. These are used a LOT in order to make the compiled code as efficient as possible. the most obvious is WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN, which is used when compiling .dlls to save overhead with unused header data members.   It is VERY COMMON (read: Standard) to have a debug mode in your program that is turned on/off with a pre-processor directive   //#define PRG_DEBUG //uncomment to enable debug mode    Above is a line of code I literally just copy pasted from one of my programs.   The fact that riot has allowed running debug code  multiple times in a few weeks  to get to live is frankly embarrassing.
0	This happened to me once. I actually was stopping at Target after clocking out at Circuit City, which is basically the same uniform. I even forgot to take off my nametag. So I kinda deserved it.   She asked me the difference between the iPod and Zune (circa 2007). Her 15 year old son noticed the Circuit City logo and said, "Momma, he don't even work here, leave him alone." I went ahead and helped her anyway, since MP3 players and computers was my section. As soon as I walked off, though, I left because I couldn't remember what the hell I went to Target for.
1	AD carries in general excel at dishing out huge amounts of damage from a distance over time, as their team protects them. In a teamfight, they are the primary damage dealers if they can position properly and survive long enough, as well as focus the right targets.   On the other hand, AP champs (mostly mids) are far more versatile. You have mids that are there for control, cc, utility (Lissandra, Orianna) and you have assassins (Le Blanc, Veigar) whose job it is to instakill the highest priority target on the opposing team.   Still, generally speaking, AP mids are almost always more bursty, since they can chain their abilities and drop squishy targets in a second.  Then again, you have AD assassins (Zed, Kha) who are played mid as well and function just like AP for the most part; there is little difference in playstile between Zed and Fizz, and one is AP, the other AD.   If its 1v1 what you're asking about, an average fed AP carry should be able to beat an AD carry, but who knows how it would work against an AD assassin; its based on skill and other conditions.   All in all, the best when it comes to 1v1ing are probably fighters and bruisers since they can survive a lot and still be a threat (think Renekton, Shen); On the other hand, they are vulnerable to kiting so any carry champion (AP or AD) with a good kit could technically outplay them with a little skill, especially late game (hence the name - carries).   The game really balances itself out, there are different playstiles and its hard to draw conclusions off the bat, there's a counter to everything and it's just about finding what suits you best.   In the example you mentioned, Vayne had no chance of escaping or dodging that combo since Oddone knew where and when he would spawn. However, if it was a real teamfight situation, he could have flashed and tumbled some of his skillshots and positioned favorably, and then finished Gragas off when he is waiting for cooldowns with a few autos. That's the downfall of traditional AP mids- cooldowns and running out of mana.
1	You got to look from the person who looks through the tribunal, there are a lot of toxic players and almost every game there are people who wants to report. And the amount of reports that needs to be viewed by the employee of Riot is a lot. Here's a suggestion, I don't usually report people but it also makes me not to queue with the toxic players, usually after a game, I wait for 5 minute if there is a toxic player in the game. Why wait 5 minute you ask ? Averagely, that will be the time for someone to go into matchmaking, pick their champions in Champ Select and star the game. So if the people start the game, you won't be able to queue with them while they are playing, so after waiting 5 minute, go back into queue and wait for your game.
0	Everything is rampant speculation at this point.  Could be Muslim terrorists. Could be a crazy-ass Republican. Could be a crazy-ass Democrat. Could be someone just plain crazy. It could also be the more extreme branch of the Church of the FSM. Could be the WBC. Could be North Korea. Could be any number of infinite other things.   Anyone cherry-picking one group out of a list of possibilities is just eager for the reality to reinforce their stereotypes. Stop fucking speculating; be better than the media.
1	This, this 100% this, but I want to elaborate on this for a bit. Ive had my share of low elo (300+ games sitting from 1000-1200elo), so I think i can confidently talk about the failings and the successes of people there. I think the key issue is that people at average elo or below tend to from what I see not acknowledge mistakes on their own part. People either do not know what a mistake looks like (most often micro like playing out a combo wrong with skills or poor item buying), or do not take blame for a mistake that they have made because of pride (mostly macro mistakes like diving at turret too early, starting teamfights without being situationally aware, poor gank calls, etc). Because they don't admit they were wrong they don't watch replays, or watch streams in effort to get better (which is a probably in part also to a lack of client integrated replays, or streams). They don't see their mistakes, they don't consciously try to stop making their mistakes and so they don't gain more skill.   The other thing I've found is that because this holds true for everyone in a game, in most cases team oriented strats don't work. Teams aren't going to be able to coordinate aoe ultis effectively, or coordinate counterjungling attempts impromptu because they simply don't know how to. You cant rely on your teammates that you know are going to make mistakes (this includes listening to pings). So the way I've found out to winning games at my elo is that the only way to guarantee victory in a game is to completely ruin your enemy laner, after which/while doing so you can roam and sway other lanes(depending on your skill), all with minimal interference from your jungler. teams at this elo wont know what to do with a 0/5 player or an 0/6 bot lane, so you will still win if you still play teamfights smart and lead well (aka ping to tell people to stop chasing, and take objectives when you can), even when your teammates throw*.   *within fucking reason, if they start suiciding to turrets for 150 gold kills or blowing all their ultis to kill the support and not the 12/0 carry , then starting teamfights there's no saving you.
1	I've tried the yorick zilean combo, its not anything special. If you don't cast the ghouls on the enemy champion and allow them to walk to the enemy than they obviously do not do much dmg by themselves, and its the equivalent of zilean just bombing the champion directly. If you cast the ghoul on the champion for the ghoul damage, then your zilean already has to be in range of casting the bomb on the champ which makes the whole thing counter-productive.
0	The public isn't well armed though. The guns that are considered "Assault Rifles" are semi-automatic guns that are the exact same as a standard hunting rifle, usually they are even of a lower caliber. The only real difference is that they look like a military rifle. Most of these guns are used by former military and gun collectors, read "Gun Nuts." The ones that we would need to actually worry about are those with mental conditions and criminals. This is why more effective background checks and making sure that people ain't purchasing guns for other people, is more effective than restricting magazine size or prohibition.   The guns are not the primary source for handling distrust in the government. It's supposed to be the media and other politicians. They are supposed to call out the corrupt so that when election time rolls around we can vote them out of office, or if the case is severe enough the judicial branches are supposed take action and remove them from office. What are we supposed to do when neither is functioning properly? The slant in the media is ridiculous and while both sides call for compromise when one side gives, the other will not hold up their end of the bargain.   The People don't want to revolt, they want the government to do it's job and let them live their lives.   "Government, even in its best state, is but a necessary evil; in its worst state, an intolerable one." - Thomas Paine
0	Haha, I worked with road construction, so I'm all for this! :D (archaeological oversight, but because of how it's organized, we always knew total cost of investment).   Fuck, man - whenever someone is bitching in my presence about "why won't they just fix them the damn roads?" too insistently - I just tell them how much it costs per km built (of like really shitty 2 lane road, nothing fancy). Has not failed to shut people up yet.   FYI this is being done in EU whenever EU pays for  anything . There's a huge-ass sign saying what fund it came from, what was the total cost, and how much EU pitched in.  Every. Single. Investition.
0	Personally, I wouldn't refer to an average 16 year old as a man or a woman.  Until you've held a job, supported a family, cared for someone... or just shown a large amount of responsibility, I don't consider that person an adult.   For example, I would not call Will Ferrel in  Step Brothers  as a man Even though he's 40 in the film, he is completely void of responsibility.  A 16 year old who gets As in school, takes care of a younger sibling in place of a parental figure, and holds a job can be referred to as a Man or Woman.   My first post was a generalization, this one drills down a bit.
1	I have over 1400 dominion games played (700+ wins) and have played Dominion on and off since it came out. Here's my take.   Do I think dominion needs some love? Absolutely. I can understand why the OP would write something as dramatic as this, because frankly the Dominion community has been in large part abandoned and forgotten by Riot. But I think there's a better way to get Riot's attention on this.   Dominion is probably a perfect tool for people at Riot to learn about managing player expectations. I don't recall the exact posts, but somewhere we were told all they had to do was "flip the switch" for ranked and they were waiting to see the health of the game before doing that. A few years later, here we are and still no ranked. Now why this is, I couldn't tell you. Probably a lot of factors come into play. Overall popularity, balance, steep learning curve, player perception, rampant botting, etc.   My problem isn't that there isn't ranked, or that the mode isn't popular.  My problem is the lack of communication by Riot on what they intended for Dominion to be, and what they intend for it to be in the future.   Riot is OUTSTANDING at communicating with players for almost every other aspect of the game. They pride themselves on being player focused, and I believe that they are. However, there's been too many inconsistencies in Riot's already small amount of communication about Dominion over the years. There is a playerbase that is super passionate about Dominion, and I think they deserve a meaningful answer on the state and future of Dominion.   The thing is... is that I don't even think Riot knows what they want to do with Dominion. There's only a handful of Rioters who work on Dominion, and it's only one of many projects that they probably work on. This ultimatum is pretty rash. I think what we really need is an executive decision from Riot on what they want to do with Dominion, and for that direction to be communicated to us. Being left in the dark for so long has been really disheartening. I don't play Dominion nearly as often as I used to.
0	coca cola made a commercial about how America was a mixing pot and all the different cultures we have here and some people threw a tiffey over it and want to at like America is a white culture with others just hear because we let them and it shouldn't be a point of pride. I saw the commercial when it aired and it was very confusing at what it was trying to sell and kinda weird but nothing offensive.
0	EDIT:  I fucking got it. Here's how it is. Let's say you're a guitarist, and you live in a house with your bandmates. You guys have the whole house together, and since you guys live together, you guys can play music together whenever you want! You got the drummer, the bass player, and even someone who donks the cowbell all ready to jam and make sweet, sweet, harmonious music whenever you want-- that's the main reason why you all moved in together.   But sometimes, you just want to chill in your room and jam by yourself. It's not that you can't round up the band and say "hey let's play together!", it's not that the music you guys all make together isn't good, and it's not that you want to play your guitar alone all the time-- but sometimes it's just as nice to kick back and diddle about with your instrument playing tunes by your lonesome.   That's masturbation within a committed relationship in a nutshell.     This mentality overlooks a number of facts, but here's one that I hope illustrates something you may not have thought of--   the good feels that I (as a female) get by masturbating (clitoral stimulation with my own fingers) is very different from the good feels that I get from two-person penis-in-vagina sex. If I get one or the other, that's great-- vaginal sex without orgasm feels good to me, and clitoral stimulation leading to orgasm feels good even if I'm not being penetrated. (Of course, if I get a combo of both (husband makes me cum via clitoral stimulation and follows up with sex), then it's amazing.)   Y'all seem to think that somehow, female masturbation is fundamentally inferior in terms of good feels to sex involving two people, and that's just plain silly. They both feel great, but sometimes, when I'm or my husband's too tired to deal with all the build up and clean up of penis-in-vagina sex, it's totally fine to jill off and go straight to sleep.
1	My take as to why this wouldn't be too good.   1)  Gives justification for inflexibility in champ select  (trolling in champ select)   Example: Last pick doesn't want to, I mean " can't ",support because he's loyal to Zed. ONLY TOP SOLO PLEASE.   2)  Gives unnecessary bragging rights as it further encourages the game to become a contest of whos dick is bigger.  Yes, we have season 2 borders and with some exceptions, we have all worked hard for the borders that we have BUT I have a gut feeling that I can't really explain(I'm sorry I can't put everything into words Reddit) that makes me believe that a champion "specialty" border award system that is so specific would be a lot worst and have the potential to produce more bad stigma.   Example1: Toxic players that have earned the border but when they see another player playing "their"  champ, especially, without the border, yeah no thanks I don't want to log on to League to get lectured 40 minutes straight by the "master of Zed". Not that constructive criticism is bad but the border awards would promote this kind of unwanted excessive chat.   Example2: "Not loyal to Zed? Report this idiot for losing his lane."   3)  How would this be able to account for the previous efforts people have put into their niche champs before an implementation of this border? Should it count normals? Are ranked stats everything?   4) Fuck you. First pick lock in  my  Zed. Trade me support or I afk.** (jealousy, stigma, 10 year old angst WHATEVER) NOT FUCKIN WORTH IT.
0	While I see your point. I think you are assuming way to much about the OP for the sake of a larger point about reddit. The behavior he pointed out is hypocritical and would be equally so if it was a man saying "no one respects me for intelligence while repeatedly drawing attention to his looks." He used the word constantly which implies this wasn't a one time thing.   For that matter, I think women would hold you to the same standard if you repeatedly drew attention to an attractive physical feature while criticizing them for only focusing on your looks.
1	I have a feeling the rework team actually thought it was a clever pun and I don't think they knew the community was pretty attached to the original name. I agree they should revert it to Spray and Pray. I think this not because of nostalgia, but rather due to the gameplay mechanics of it in the same way I understand and agree with the Expunge rename, as it was actually misleading.   At the very least they should fix the bugs with it if they're going to rename it. Spray and Pray at least implied it missed, but Rat-a-tat-tat doesn't give me the idea that I will often miss targets due to it being a projectile, as well as be unable to damage inhibs or nexus while active.
1	So. You play support nidalee, take all the kills, go AP and don't ward. It's normals after all, and if they're messing with you why not mess with them? Or just lock in your role, they won't want to lose as premade, they'll conform.
1	Which is more exciting, unlocking a new champion, or unlocking a rune that is required to be able to the game?   You're preachin' to the choir.   The only thing I don't agree with is only unlocking preset runes. Riot would be enforcing current meta. All runes should be unlocked. The only thing you should be able to buy is rune pages with ip/rp.   Too the people who think that starting newbies with nothing is better. Think rationally for a second;   If you want to be competitive with Starcraft 2 you have to train. There is no barrier to entry to be a top level player other than you. If you want to be a top level dota 2 player once again there is no barrier to entry except you. If you want to be a top level CoD player there is no barrier to entry except you.   If you want to be a top level League of Legends player then you have to have runes, the masteries, champion unlocks (at least 15--I think), you have to get to level 30. At level twenty you have to learn the current meta as the meta is slightly different without runes. Yes all completely possible but in that time of leveling from 1-30 you could of been practicing with several different champions. Learned how to create rune pages that are decent or just copy people who are already at the top. I'm pretty sure that most people who play this game do that anyway.   Also remember that most casual players just want to play the game with a beer in their hand and a joint in their mouth. Why create artificial barriers and unneeded fluff?   EDIT: Wow, I typed a lot...
0	I'll just leave this here, I asked this girl out to prom, I was fucking nervous as hell and when she said yes I was so fucking happy. A couple of days later she pulls me aside in the hallway and tells me she can't go with me. Heart broken a friend went with me. Low and behold I see herthere by herself and I never did get a good answer why she didn't go with me. But ya
1	I'm sorry, but you're making huge speculation out of something very vague that was even said in another language.   And who honestly thinks EDG has a chance of 1st against SGW? Group A is already set in first and second unless we see SGW be massively worse than they have been all year. There's no possibility of "strategic" match-fixing accomplishing anything, in my eyes.
0	I think my response to your unpopular argument is an even more unpopular argument.   I do support the idea that you should learn to love yourself. But I also think that when it comes to attractiveness, there is some degree of intersubjective consensus on what features are attractive and what features are not as attractive. The intersubjectivity developed due to evolution; indicators of attractiveness (such as symmetry, for example) signal potential mates that the attractive person is a healthy person to mate with for reproduction.   I don't think that the government should pay for every single modification to your body; I don't think you should be able to say, hey, I have a 7-inch penis, but if it were 8-inches, I think I would be able to have even more sex! So government, pay for an inch-long extension to my penis.   But at the same time, I think that if you have an attribute that causes you to have severe mental anguish, and you cannot afford to ameliorate the condition, then I do think that the government ought to help you out. As an opposite example, a person with a micropenis should receive government help. (Obviously, this pre-supposes a universal health care system like the one found in Canada or the UK)   So I think it should be done on a case-by-case basis. Certain features, like micropenis, gynecomastia, etc. can cause major grief. I don't think fixing it alone will suddenly make you happy. But it is one part of the process.   Just like the right to life is hollow without an adequate health care system, reproductive rights are also hollow if you do not care for individuals with major deformities that almost serve as an affirmative bar against being able to reproduce.
1	They should make it so if more than 2 people is in range of the turret the solo laner can get the option to jump into the turret with all his abilities/basic attack being ranged with 100% cdr and 750 attack range, while being unable to being attacked unless the tower dies. I don't think this would affect the game play that much, and it would for certain make the game alot more enjoyable to watch.
1	That's what I'm inclined to believe. If Mejai's and/or Archangel's weren't full, then that would explain the 3155 damage, instead of 3678 damage.   Cooldown on the spear is 6 seconds, which with 40% CDR (max) would be 3.6 second cooldown. Nidalee could have gotten 3 off in a total of 9.14 seconds, considering we know she has at least 15% CDR from boots, without much problem.   3 Spears would mean each one did about 1050 damage, which seems plausible.   If Nidalee had max MPen (as calculated below), each would do about 1608 damage, making it quite possible to get this amount of damage in 2 spears. However, this requires a nearby fiddlesticks, as well as a nearby Abyssal Scepter, and Nidalee to have maximum MPen runes.   I think it's more likely that OP has an effective MR of (78 - 8.55 (from Nid's runes) - 50% (Nid's masteries + void staff) = 39.775 MR) which means each of these spears would do about 1316 damage if all of Nidalee's items were fully stacked, which I don't think is likely.
1	I feel like FNC became overly cautious after that horrible early tower dive. But later they played so well again, awesome.
1	I always thought that each core should be representative of a playstyle and not a skill   i.e get Augment Death level 1 for the same effect Augment power Death (3k-4k gold all up) should then change his Q,W and R ie Q: 10% more damage against targets burning from damage W: Enemies take a DoT or something R: DoT   So buying Death turns you into a burn king   Buying Gravity should make you a kiter utility king Q applies a stack of his bubble slow so they dont need to be in it as long to be stunned Etc for his E and R   You know, the whole 'evolution' theme
1	i for one woulda had to wait for the stupid vote counter to tick all the way down before pressing the ban button... I have a7 year old and a 10 year old nephew that both play..   The 'DONG' comment is insta ban imo... it might not be major to you .. but to me it says you have a complete lack of respect for the community and all the various types of people that play this game.   You sir ARE the reason we must have the tribunal.   Also .. it's a proven fact that the Tribunal works.. and YES it's going to seem that the majority is ban votes.. but pull your head out of your ass and realize that people don't get reported for being amazing humans..   This is like saying.. "I think all the serial killers in jain get screwed when they come up for parol cause the system is flawed.." They are FUCKING mass murderers..
1	Well written I can say.   In my opinion the raging people you've met so far are either too young, or new to the game. Allright, maybe it's not about age, someone just never grows up, but in many cases it can be experienced how people get wiser the older they are. I always think of myself as being one step ahead of my age, and still see the naive mistakes I've done in the past. Even in LoL, I play this game for more than one and a half year and used to be one of the ragers. Nothing really changed since then, only my attitude, because in the past I played to win, as I thought it's the fun part of the game. Nowadays I see it in an other way, I play every single game for fun, even the desperately lost ones, I never ever surrender and I feel much happier. Thinking about it this way saves me a lot of frustration and also made my performance better. To be honest I'm quite envy of you, that you could enjoy every moment of your gameplay from the very first moment of starting League of Legends, while I and many other players needed time to see things clearly. This is the exact opposite of a problem, be fucken proud of it, and give other players time, stay nice.   Unfortunately I don't exactly know how it is to be addicted to something like you do. I play quite extended periods of time when I've got the time anyways, but when more important things come in (not only work, or in my case studying) I can pretty much do them without just thinking about LoL. As long as you have fun playing it, and it doesn't cause you troubles I suggest you keep on doing what you like to do.   Edit: My favourite champion is Irelia, as you can see her next to my name. Got her on release, and also all the (3) skins. I was luckier in this case, as I played LoL for several months by then, so I had experience with many champs already. Since you are new to this game it's like a miracle that you don't get stomped all day long by the smurfs out there, many new players give up or stay in coop vs ai because of this problem, another reason to be proud.
0	I had a teacher in 7th grade, one of those "Everyone is out to get me types". My school had a program where the kids would raise and lower the flag everyday. This was especially cool because the school was near an Army fort. Well my friend, whose father was deployed at the time, was in this program and was in the formerly specified teachers class at the end of the day. My friend asked to go lower the flag and the teacher said no. My friend explained how important it was to her, you know since her dad is deployed and all, and the teacher responds with, "No, you know why? Cause your dad put himself in that position. When a soldier dies, I don't feel bad because the brought that upon themselves."  My friends mom, naturally, was pissed. She went to the school, demanding blood, and the principal was willing to help. However, once called in, the teacher comes storming in screaming about how if they tried to fire her, she would get the NAACP on the schools ass so fast, blah blah blah.
0	She's actually not stupid and can make very valid points.](  People don't take her seriously sometimes because the way she acts and represents herself to the public eye.  She's a smart woman who knows what it takes in today's music industry to be at the top.
1	Hijacking top comment for my story, sorry.   I have Panic Disorder, Agoraphobia, and all forms of anxiety. Happened about 3 years ago now and my life has been completely changed. I still rarely leave the house due to fear of the world and having an attack somewhere I don't feel safe. One thing that helped me when I got anxious was playing game's, WoW, LoL, Dota, anything with other people on. Than when I finally hit 30 and started ranked, I tried it. Got so anxious it would give me a panic attack. For those who don't know a panic attack is probably the worst thing you can experience in life mentally. You truly believe you are dying. I quit LoL after that for a good 6 months. I tried again with friends, just duoing. After awhile the anxiety lessened and I started to have fun. My diamond friend gave me a tip that made such a difference. He told me to never look at ranked 1 game at a time or to worry about 1 game. But instead look at it 20 or so games at a time, and just forget your last game always. I did and it helped so much. I went from bronze 3 to Gold on 2 accounts last season. I'm pushing for plat this season!
0	Try working in an ER on New Year's Eve, I was leaving at 1130 and had plans to meet up with some friends for drinks but my last patient shit all over himself and tried to wipe himself but got it on his hands and then on everything he touched. By the time I left it was already 2015.
0	This might come as a surprise to you, but how people act on the interwebs and how they actually are, are two different things most of the time. Someone who makes racist and/or sexist jokes on the internet, is not necessarily a racist and/or sexist. You know, stereotypes make for good jokes and guess what, most of the successful comedy shows etc. are based on them.   Plus stuff like "too fat, wouldn't f'%#", "something something sandwich" or "back to the kitchen her derr" are more like a meme than actual opinions.
1	It's not American culture as a whole but it's American youth and especially American "gaming" culture.   What NA really needs is  adults . People 25-30+ who aren't there so much to teach them about league but to teach them about life. Hard work, flexibility, professionalism, shit like that. Maybe find some former military NCOs (Sgt/SSgt/GySgt, though i feel the latter two would be a bit on the old side, they'd be pushing 45) who happen to play league and get them into these organizations. Either that or maybe bring in people with coaching exp from other sports etc. What NA needs is structure and disipline   A lot of the problems with NA have very little to do with player skill and a LOT more to do with player mentality compared with Asia and Europe. NA is highly undisciplined, highly incestuous and nepotistic, and is more about celeb culture than any real leadership, and if you happen to be a celeb on a certain team, then the team strategy, player acquisition, everything revolves around them (for example, Counterlogic Gaming, and you're starting to see it with Bjergsen and Wildturtle who apparently bitch and whine when the jungler isn't camping their lane). Or look what happened with Rekkles where you have a team cancer that happens to be real talented but they replaced him with a steady, no frills ADC and turns out that they can push SKT1 to the limit, or with TL where Piglet is being outperformed by a random until he starts to synergize with the team.   Meanwhile, C9 dominated every split until Hai's physical problems and the decline of their individual players save for Sneaky caught up to them to the point where their organizational strength couldn't make up for it.
0	Rented a house with one my closest friends/cousin (she's in her mid 20's) and her husband. Found out they couldn't actually make the rent, were lazy entitled assholes, and best of all she was actually a toxic-psycho-bitch that made my life hell.   She started threatening to kill herself to get her way and throwing tantrums. I said I wanted to end the living arrangement. They still wanted to live there, so I offered to help them find new roommates. They realized other people wouldn't be as generous as me with the rent and insisted that I take over the entire lease myself. I obliged.   After that she set out to hurt me as much as she possibly could, lied to friends and family, and claimed they were kicked out and left homeless. I lost relationships with her family that I had had my whole life and lost thousands of dollars trying to finish out the lease on my own while trying to sell the lease to new tenants.   Lived the next few months with near-constant anxiety over the whole ordeal.
1	I dont get why you had to explain to me what malz's combo is :/ I was talking about what his ult does as damage (corrected to 250 / 400 / 550 (+ 130% AP)), and that its far from just a supression. I know his combo, as i main malz mid, so there is no need to tell ^ ^ usually you can kill ppl with just Q-E-R, the W is more for tanks if we are talking mechanics (but is a deathsentence for a squishy champ).
0	That's actually how I knew the girl I fell in love with and lived with for 50 years was a made up, I couldn't recall her face upon waking. Just a nose-like obstruction and indents where her eyes would have been. She talked to me despite not having a mouth. Dreams are weird.
1	I agree that SOME of the problem is lack of item diversity, but we can all agree that some champions are incredibly deficient. To keep the it with the adc comparision, Ashe probably got the item buffs she wanted and yet Kog, Twitch, Cait, and Trist will always be picked for auto attack champs first. Why? Ashe's passive sucks, she has no steroids, and deficient mobility.   Another example: Malz. He's got some great stuff in his kit, but nearly every professional mid laner is going to play syndra over malz. Why? He has lots of counterplay that syndra simply can avoid. His ult CC's himself in team fights and can be interrupted, whereas syndra's ult happens instantaneously and it doesn't even stop her movement. In order for malz to CS and sustain mana, he uses his main source of damage with his E on creeps. This gives your lane opponent a HUGE window to win trades. His rank 1 Q will take up a fourth of his mana pool and do an extremely short silence and no damage. Just dash towards him and win the trade. It won't be til malz gets lvl 7 that his dot will be able to kill creeps without aid.   These are just TWO examples of champions being incredibly deficient. There needs to be more consideration of these champs. Heck, Quinn has NEVER seen regular professional play. She doesn't fit the meta. A marksman that becomes a melee and gains no defensive stats to go into melee? Shorter attack range than Vayne? No item change is going to get Quinn regular play. No item change.   Since Riot isn't coming out with champions as frequently as they used to, I'd like to see more frequent reworks. 3 a month should be cake for such a successful company. I think we all prefer them showing effort and messing up champions here and there in reworks and then later fixing them. But watching them not exude any effort at all is unacceptable.
0	I want you to know you're not alone. All I can think of is if Supercuts is a place that cuts hair, then they either have a haircut called the "apple" or they all use Apple products.  If it's the former, then the "apple" haircut must be very, very popular, and the employees do not like to cut it over and over. If it's the latter...I guess they all REALLY like Apple computers and they go crazy over them?
1	This update makes literally 0 fucking sense. I understand the update is to improve reliability of the server platform, however what is the point of rebuilding the entire server from the ground up in the exact same location? The only solution to solving the east coast problems is moving the data center but it seems like there is 0% chance of that happening if they do a new server build in the exact same spot.
0	Reminds me of a funny story with my mom.  I was like 12 at the time and we were at a boat ramp area near the coast so there are tons of seagulls like always.  As we were heading out and going towards the road a seagull was just walking along in front of us.  My mom stopped the car hoping it would move along and I told her to just go cause it would fly away like they always do.  Well at the slow pace of like 3 miles per hour my mom proceeds and runs right over the damn thing, its like it had just given up on life and decided we were his best chance at getting taken out.  I looked back and we had one wing still flapping and I just told her to not look and just go.  I must tease her about that at least a couple times a year still, she felt so bad.
0	Have a go at the computer angle - Fifa or Pro Evolution Soccer ;) Seriously now, you can try engaging people on the topics you are passionate about, if they respond, great - if they're not interested then don't beat yourself up about not being interested in their chats yourself. Seriously, you don't have to be the life of a party (or office). It is NOT a requirement for winning at life or having fun. Especially if you don't get to choose people you will be spending time with. Be yourself and whatever social awkwardness happens, you won't remember it in 5 years (unless you bring an AK to the office one day...).
1	Here's a good guide by Westrice at Solomid. It will give you a good idea for masteries and runes. As for playstyle, be very passive before you get your ultimate and focus on getting as many CS as you possibly can get. Once you hit level 6, poking becomes much easier, as you deal tons of damage with Q. Speaking of, my preferred skill order is Q-E-W, maxing R at 6-11-16. Now, one thing you must know about akali in order to deal as much damage as you can : Casting Q then R immediately afterwards causes you to get to your target before your Q, wasting an auto-attack, therefore wasting your Q. The trick is to cast your Q and wait half a second to a second. Then jump at your target with R and enjoy seeing a good chunk of your enemies HP drop.
1	For me it wasn't that Arcade Sona and DJ Sona are similar, just that I can't imagine a Sona main that wouldn't have arcade. It's such a great skin already that piling another great skin on top of it is kind of weird. Especially when there are other champions that are fairly meh in the skin selection category.   With Ezreal and Udyr's ultimates, they were for champions without a selection of excellent skins. Not so with Sona.
1	But then you can't hear the commentators, and a lot of people want that.  One thing it does help however, is that quite a few people will watch it via spectator mode and not the stream, which reduces the number of people watching the stream, which reduces the load that twitch.tv has to handle, which is what they have been struggling with for tournaments.
0	A new study expanding on the first (more controlled variables) that showed a potential existence for non-celiac gluten sensitivity has shown that gluten actually isn't the cause for GI stress. Levels of gluten do not have any effect on patients that claim a non-celiac gluten sensitivity. It is actually a reduction of fermentable, poorly absorbed, short-chain carbohydrates instead that alleviates the "GI sensitivity". These are frequently found in food that also contains gluten.

1	you can't sit there and say EU is better than NA based on old tournaments. Times change, teams change. Look at Fnatic, looked amazing for the first few weeks. They look like shit now."   You must have been asleep the last week, which is fine, but if you were, dont try to give any reasonable insight into the pro- scene.   Fantic just LAST WEEK got 2nd place at the IEM world championships and therefore finished as the best western team (once again). They did beat C9, the only north american team who even performed somewhat decent internationally in recent history.   Despite being somewhat big mouthed (dyrus at worlds for instance) TSM has been doing absolutely atrocious in international competitions. They were the Nr.2 team in one of the weakest regions so far. They look significantly stronger now than they did before, but why? Because this guy called bjergsen absolutely hard carries at least 80% of their games.   Now, while Bjergsen is without a doubt a fantastic player, he was by FAR not as dominant back when he was in the EU LCS. Sometimes he won his lane, sometimes he lost it, sometimes he went even. Basically, he was pretty much in the middle of the pack. Which is great, he is one of europes best midlaners, but you cant compare "being one the best of a role" to "absolutely stomping your opponent in 90% of the games and making them look like a gold ranked player at best".   "Europe is streaky as shit" same argument that people made last season because europe's LCS was so close, and people make the same mistake yet again. They assume that its because the top teams are so inconsistent, when its just the simple fact that the EU LCS is more competitive than NA's.   CLG? They havent proven anything but being a top 3 team in one of the weakest regions there is. Everyone is talking about them being a world class team with dexter on board, when they got shitstomped by EU's last place team with exactly the same lineup.
0	So, this was brought up a moment ago in a different thread in this comment section.  It is true that I have made a misstep here.  I was trying to speak about the general tendency of the standard religious fanatic to be more violent than a standard atheist fanatic.  What I failed to make clear (and may have actually said things effectively the opposite of) was that I don't believe it to be the religion or lack of religion that causes this-- rather, some violent people adopt religion as an excuse to do violence.  In that thread, I mentioned the IRA, but failed to note that most IRA violence was really about divided people holding grudges and using religion to identify who was on the other side, not actually killing people for their religion, per se.   What I really want to say is this: people do good or ill based on their moral belief structures; sometimes these structures are formed by their religion, but overwhelmingly it is life experience, and then contextualized by or manipulated into the guise of religion.  A religious person is not, by nature of their religion, going to be a violent person.  Overwhelmingly the opposite, in fact.  But a violent person is more likely to claim religion as their motivation than they are to claim atheism, simply for the reason that the former is easier.  This paints an unfair impression of religions, not truly reflective of the general message of "do good, be nice, form a community devoted to being kind."  But it also leads to the tendency that a "religious fanatic" (whose true motivations might be anything, really, but who is willing to kill anyone who disagrees) tends to be more violent than an "atheist fanatic" (who generally just wants to defend their own beliefs or lack-thereof in a society in which atheism is not the norm, and does so by being a dick over the internet or in conversation).  It is therefore unfair to say that an atheist fanatic is less tolerant than religious fanatic.   EDIT:
0	As far as I'm aware, the only real concerns come from those who take estrogen based BCPs (most if not all pills). They give a very high risk to blood clotting (of which I've had due to taking BCPs, hence me using Implanon now).   From everything I've read and been taught from my GYN about Implanon, there is no downside as far as long term. Literally, if I were to get it taken out today, I could happily and safely become pregnant within 24 hours were I to be on my ovulation cycle.   The only thing about Implanon (and this goes with any hormone you take) is that the acute effects can be different for everyone. Some gain weight, some lose weight, some have heavier periods, some have less or none at all. It just depends on who you are. I've just heard a lot more women rejoice in the effects of Implanon more than curse about it.   I have not used IUD (intrauterine device), but it seems unappealing to have something shoved into my cervical opening.   Pills just suck though. They always made me break out and gain weight, and honestly made me more prone to PMS. ):
0	Also, can you guess how you did on the litmus test?"   Not looking to get into a flame war with you, but you miss the mark, completely.   You  failed the information literacy litmus test.  In your responce to me you didn't even  address  what I explained to be the fatal error of the wiki model - lack of  authority.   Again, this has absolutely  nothing  to do with the technology used to publish and deliver it and  everything  to do with the editoial process used to complile and create the information in the first place.   Your  litmus test doesn't actually tell you anything about me - I'm quite tech savvy and more often than not an earlier adopter.  I'm also a librarian with a much-better-than-average (a) familiarity with and (b) importance placed upon information literacy and the critical evaluation of information resources.  Chalk it up to - when it comes to "trusting" a source, my standards are  a lot  higher than a wiki will ever meet.   But again, and I can't stress this enough -  nothing  to do with technology.  The annonymous, open-to-all, "let's crowdsource our attempt to garner authority for our resource" approach would be every bit as flawed no matter what the technology.  It could be written on parchment with quill pens by (random, annonymous) men in powdered wigs and it still be no more authoritative.   " . . . teachers had this hangup that the internet was full of false information."   The internet  is  full of false information.   Here's a tourist information site for the town of Mankato, MN -  Bet you didn't know Minnesota had a set of Great Pyramids just like the ones in Egypt, underwater ruins believed to be Atlantis, or that we had whales on the Minnesota river.   The internet is also full of true information.   Here's the real Mankato visitor information site -   Now those are obviously an extreme example (although the professor who put up the fake one for purposes of demonstating  this  very lesson continues to get complaints from time to time from people  so  credible and information illiterate that they travelled to Mankato to see those very attractions), there are literally  millions  of others that aren't so extreme and wouldn't be so easy to spot.  On a site that actually  looked  "legit" on a topic that you  had no  personal expertise or famility with, it'd be a different story.  Especially if everybody had you convinced that that site was "more accurate than Brittanica."   In its own way, that's part of the awsomeness of the internet - it's fracking  ginormous  and we all get to contribute and participate.  On the other hand its greatest weakness - it's fracking  ginormous  and anyone can publish anything - accurate or inaccurate, treasure or trash.   At the end of the day, any given piece of information in the wiki is probably OK.  However, no way to be sure unless (a) you yourself are already an expert and can see for yourself what's accurate and what isn't or (b) you double-check with an authoritative source.   So would I  use  it?  Sure.  Casual conversation, reddit arguments, trivial pop culture stuff, as a starting point to track down real sources on a new topic, I'll use it.   Trust  it?  In a context that actually  matters,  say professional or academic work?  Never.   As for your litmus test I think you have it backwards.  You seem to be one of those guys (we need a word that has the exact opposite meanings and connotations as "luddite"), who throws out the kind of skepticism you might use in any other context to automatically and unabashedly embrace anything just  because  it involves "tech."  I think if I handed you a book on a topic you were unfamiliar with and said - "Here's an annonymous book on the topic that I pulled randomly off the shelf with no vetting whatsoever" your skepticism would reassert itself.   Or we could do a little experiment: 1 - Anti-biotics do not cure viral infections. 2 - Pains in your left chest may indicate a heart attack. 3 - Strep throat is contageous. 4 - One rare but possible side effect of using Asprin is bloody urine.   Every piece of medical information I just posted is correct and accurate.  I have a 100% accuracy rate on the topic.  So if you wake up pissing blood tomorrow, will you be posting on Reddit for me to diagnose you, or will you be going to a doctor?  Who wins, tech or authority?
1	it was meant to be a fun mode and not be taken seriously, when people start try harding and playing the stuff that's broken to the point riot has to disable it from the game mode then the mode is no longer fun. but please, keep telling me that "that's called playing the bloody game and people do it in regular games as well so that's a stupid reason not to have it."
1	It's definitely a possibility that voice communication with strangers might not actually increase your chances of winning, considering people will make mistakes in shotcalling (and instead of that 1 guy fucking up, the entire team follows and you get aced), people might get nervous, annoyed, etc etc etc.   You seem to think it's really obvious that voice communication improves winrates (which it MIGHT), but there is no proof of that. Obviously it's great in professional games but that's simply an entirely different story.
0	Quite light? I don't think you understand how much an electron weighs. A watermelon worth of mass is an insanely heavy for the number of electrons.   This isn't a great comparison, but it's the closet one I could come up with, without wasting time trying to find a good ratio.   The mass of electrons that is inside a watermelon of 10 pounds is CLOSE to the mass of humans in the sun.
1	philos would definitely not be as effective as lasthitting. let's assume your enemy lasthits 5 minions per wave (disregarding busdriver minions here). He'd get an average of about 15 gold per minion, having him get 75g per wave. if you lasthit say 3 minion sper wave and 3 die without you getting them, you only get 3x15+3x2=51 gold. that's 24 short of the enemy. per wave. +you spent 375 on an item that gives you no battlestats whatsoever so you would be very susceptible to harass/trading.   Regarding the execute gp10: it only works twice a minute, so once per wave, it's a good bonus (bonusgold+healing) having lasthitting synced with your sup (him taking a minion per wave or two every second) but will never outweigh bad lasthitting.
0	ike a lot of people, when this first surfaced in my newsfeed, i was upset. not terribly surprised, unfortunately, but upset.   i was upset because as a server, i know what its like to have the capability to pay for necessities like food and rent lie with strangers. strangers who have their own damn problems, and who are slaves to their own personal environments and stupid human emotions just as much as i am. the difference? i have to pretend like im having the BEST DAY EVER whilst working, whereas diners get to be grumpy and irrational whilst they  determine how much i get paid  based (all too often) on said environmental and mood factors. this is a hazard of the service industry, and anyone who has done it for any length of time at all knows it has a tendency to balance itself based the economic service model -a theory im working on that is as-yet unavailable to the public. but i digress.   i was upset because, while the love of my life happened to be a big, haired-over man (im looking at you, george riley), it could just as easily have been a petite, blonde woman. or a big, haired over woman.. you get my drift. and i think that nobody deserves to be discriminated against, especially for something over which they have no control.   now, though, im upset for a different reason. im upset that some waitress in Anytown, USA had so little going for her that she had to fabricate this inciting incident in order for her to have her own 15 minutes of fame. im probably a little more upset about this than i should be, but this mystery server really appealed to my soft side and had me rooting for her. YES! people should hear about this! like! share!   again, it shouldnt surprise me that this is just a narcissistic internet hoax, or a troll under the bridge flaming the naive (like me!), but it does. and it upsets me that i so eagerly jumped on the hate-the-mystery-couple-who-stiffed-the-poor-waitress bandwagon. let this be a reminder to everybody - myself included - that just because we have, at our fingertips, the entire culmination of human knowledge, it doesnt mean all information given to us is accurate. the internet is a breeding ground for collaboration, a hub of information sharing, the great communications equalizer, but remember that with the anonymity it awards us comes also the capability for deception. NOT EVERYTHING YOU SEE ON THE INTERNET IS TRUE.   basically the point of this long rant is to remind myself and everybody who sees it to check your facts and do a little evidentiary research before you circle the wagons and hand out pitchforks. this is a bad time of year to feel jaded and cynical, but we deserve it to ourselves to take the extra few minutes to research an inciting article or piece of news before the "ERMAGHERRD 0__o wut dafuq !1! These ppls aint christns n burn hell1!!!1" reaction takes hold.
1	Tried giving a tip once, will probably not attempt again.   We're about to win the game, and their 2-13 Heimer started complaining about all the slow my Rumble had. I simply suggested "Heimer, next time if you want try to build for a rylai's, it'll give you some nice slow"   His Response: "stfu I know how to play my champ blahblahblahblah" My Retort: "ok"
1	No, but you should be explaining your reasoning as to why you don't think my changes would be a good addition to building a better LeBlanc, and in turn should give your ideas on how to create more counter play to her kit whilst still retaining enjoyable mechanics.   ..Which is what I would have said (again), until I found out you are pretty blatantly retarded when it comes to understanding how the champion's kit works since:   a) You don't even play the champion. b) You haven't played against the champion. c) Your comparisons are illogical.   Riot has shown to be hypocritical with their so called 'design ethic' of counter player time and time again, so that's out the window.
1	It's not a bad idea but, as someone who plays on a Challenger 5's team (Team Try Again), it would remove a certain element of practice. If you want to see the enemy team and practice banning people out strategically, you can always scrim for that. But if you were to remove the element of secrecy from ranked 5's queue then you would lose your ability to practice adapting to unexpected strategies and situations to a large extent.
1	I ve climbed my way from below bronze to diamond 2 in the past 3 season and I can tell you that there are ALOT of immature people in every elo division league however you want to call it
1	Like everyone else here, I can only really weigh in with my opinion on the matter. I became interested in LoL during the 2013 allstars, when I saw it on Twitch one night. I decided I liked Dyrus and MadLife, so the teams I supported became TSM and CJ Frost. Right now, both those teams have changed heavily since I started playing, and if MadLife or Dyrus was to leave their respective teams, well, I'd probably drop my support for CJ Frost, because I follow MadLife more than his team, though I'd still follow TSM because of Regi and TheOddOne, even if the current roster isn't a group that I'm necesarily fans of.   Further to that, I also liked scarra a lot, so Dignitas was my second favourite team in NA. However, no scarra on Dig means no support from me, but I'm also not going to support CLG just because he's on that team, because I'm not a fan of CLG.   This is kinda different to how I feel about the EU LCS, where I support players such as Alex Ich, but stick to the actual teams for SHC and CW, regardless of their players.   In Korea on the other hand, I kinda got behind SKT after last years worlds, and despite the roster changes, I still support them. I don't think I would necessarily stop if their roster changed entirely either, I have no desire to support Curse just because Piglet is there now.   In terms of China, I don't really follow the LPL, but I was supporting OMG all throughout worlds, partly because of Gogoing, but also because I just like the team.   It all sounds kinda messy but, while I generally support players first, there are instances where the actual team/org is getting my support as well. I think it comes down a lot to the fact that certain players are much more the face of their teams brand (pretty prominent in NA), where as other teams don't really have public faces as much, and so my support does fall behind the org, not just it's players.
1	That actually made sense though!   Come to think of it, that's probably why I sucked so hard at lol when I started. I didn't realize that the abilities were basically just types of ability (i.e.: skillshot, nuke, dash, etc.), so I was trying to think logically about what stuff could do. I hated not having time to cast an ability, so I kept buying attack speed so I could get my spells off faster. I thought Nocturne's ult was the coolest thing in the world, so I got movement speed trying to make other people's dashes move that fast. Galio could fly, so I didn't think stuff on the ground (like traps) would affect him.
1	Hi,   Im not here to argue but more here to enlighten you on howsubreddits work. and my thought processes because of it.   The voting system this is taken from the FAQ of reddit.   A submission's score is simply the number of upvotes minus the number of downvotes. If five users like the submission and three users don't it will have a score of 2. Please note that the vote numbers are not "real" numbers, they have been "fuzzed" to prevent spam bots etc. So taking the above example, if five users upvoted the submission, and three users downvote it, the upvote/downvote numbers may say 23 upvotes and 21 downvotes, or 12 upvotes, and 10 downvotes. The points score is correct, but the vote totals are "fuzzed".   This means that if 2000 is at the very least the difference, because of reddit fuzzing it out we do not know how many people exactly supported it and fought agasit it.   So what I am saying is that the majority of the community could have infact agreed on it if they were up by 2000. Since you can downvote and also upvote the threads are determined by the majoirty of voters.   Now we do not know what that number is but we can imply that based on a "2000" difference and the number of comments, as well as how one sided the comments are, that not everyone upvotes downvotes in this subreddit of 500k+, so from the people that voice there opinion I do think the majorette of people did infact hate on Nein. Since when you talk about majority rules you usually have a voting system. Even in real life if you choose note to vote we cant say you were or were not part of the majority. You can agree or disagree with the majority  but things get to the top for a reason, people voicing there opinions.
0	Wow. You are a fucking moron. No, fourth graders don't need to have sex. Nor do seventh graders. They are little kids. There is a consequence to sex and it is PREGNANCY! Not everyone needs to have sex let alone a nine year old.   At no point did I say abstinence is the way to teach kids. Yes, teens and people will have sex and it doesn't benefit to try and keep them from it. But no, little kids don't need to know about it or the right way to put on a condom at nine.  The only reason I said that about abstinence was because they said we need to not teach abstinence. The OP picture didn't mention a thing about abstinence.
0	Jehovah's Witnesses don't even celebrate birthdays. In high school, a girl in our Ensemble was JW. When anyone's birthday happened to fall on a school day, we'd sing happy birthday for them with piano, harmony, etc. Sure enough, this girl's birthday came and as soon as the piano started, she started freaking out "No, guys! Don't!" We thought she was just being coy (as we didn't know she was JW), and kept going. She started crying immediately and ran out of the room.
1	Yeah, customs are so weird. They need to set it to just drop in drop out. It's a custom game, it means nothing. If you want to leave a game in progress, even if it is a full 5v5 you shouldn't be punished. That's why it is custom and not normals/ranked.   I have had so many times where I want to practice a jungle route, or just practice cs with a friend and we have such a hard time actually fully getting out of a custom game. It almost always says "A game you left is still in progress". Uh. No it's not, I left, leave me alone custom games.
0	I Come from one of the richest communities in NJ, from a school where 99% of graduating class went to a 4 year schools a large portion of which were Ivy. 1) I didn't join for money ( if you really think people do this you should check out pay scales for enlisted soldiers, it's sad) 2) I couldn't have cared less about college money. 3) you look down upon, but you should be PROUD of all those who join to escape poverty, they could do like the rest of their neighbors and sling rock while collecting welfare. Instead they soldier the fuck up ( pun intended) and provide a take an insane gamble to provide a much better life for their families. And 4) Many of us are well aware of the atrocities that occur during war, and we go over there to make sure the job gets done right.   Source Veteran
0	I get that at every restaurant I walk into. I'm a big white guy. I know people aren't thinking "wow, that looks like a friendly fellow" every time they look at me. If you stand out, you're going to get looked at. It's not necessarily negative, unless you clearly see somebody eye fucking you or sneering at you.   To that end, I grew up around and in the not-so-white parts of Houston. My buddy took me to his all black Baptist church one Sunday when we were about 20. So I was a 6'6" 260 lb white guy at an all black church in a place where they take their church time seriously. You can imagine the number of "weird" looks I got. Not a soul there didn't know me by name, and I by theirs, by the end of service. Ended up being the most fun I've ever had at a church experience. I'm not religious by any stretch, but I still stop in when I visit family every few years, just to say hi to everyone. There's always new members, and I still get a lot of weird looks, but they always turn to smiles after we all get to know each other.
1	It's down to how people play her imo, because she has some of the best disengage skills in the game. If you think you're going to get ganked pre-2, then you just don't skill up an ability until you hit 2.   If you don't, you missed out on some harrass with an arguably OP level 1 dmg from your Q powered up passive, if you do, you can ctrl+e and have the advantage in any case.   I honestly think that squishier supports should start boots 1 ward 1 pot anyway. Honestly, I tend to take boots 1 1 on supports like Leona too, anything without a speed boost or anything I want to turn into an aggressive lane, because most other supports don't take boots, and I want to close the gap asap. People just need to 'think.'   Lately, Sona is being counterpicked hard as well, and it's about time. Any time I see a Sona pick as first or second, I punish it hard with Leona, or Blitz., the champion is a joke anyway- spamming qwe randomly is what 95% of the players do, so it's really easy to punish them.   As for those that know how to play her, you negate a lot of her poke with a champ like Blitz/Leona because of the fear factor.
0	This is completely unrelated to the content of this post, but this page just made me incredibly angry... Let me explain. I just got a nice new shiny 23" monitor about 2 months ago. I then proceed to use my computer merrily on a regular basis for a while until I came upon this post right here. I noted the meme. Decently funny. I scrolled down to see what sort of pointless comments I could stumble over. And there, right there--in the middle of the screen--I saw it. A small black dot. A black dot that should be white. That could only mean one thing, my brand new shiny monitor that I have been so merrily using has died- or at least a pixel of it. On the verge of screaming at the small devilish black abyss surrounded by a glowing white sea, I chose to leave this page, the page that brought me this torment. On the main page of Reddit it vanished. The speck was gone. It was just a glitch, a blip, a dream. And yet, here it is again. The dot appears as soon as I come here, but it is absent everywhere else on the internet or my computer for that matter. It sits idly watching my every move so long as I am on this single solitary page. This place is evil, and all should fear it.
1	Also, as a support there isn't much you can personally do as an individual to stop an Olaf other than trying to grab his attention and direct him towards you as a freebie to pick up, allowing time for your team to take a 4v4 against theirs without their major anti-carry involved. If they don't even want to fight, it still gives them room to try to recover and defend under a turret with his ult down.
0	My brother was in a bad motorcycle accident(sides-swiped by a distracted driver on the freeway) was launched off the motorcycle and landed flat on his back. He was headed to school and had his Macbook pro and gym clothes in his backpack, which according to the doctors saved his back and prevented his head from hitting the ground. The Macbook had a small den't and still works flawlessly.
1	I played with two 15 year olds yesterday and they started out by telling me what champ to pick and when it was too late to pick a different champ, he goes and says "gg report nid" and then his friend starts the game telling me to "spear the bush, bitch" and does not stop calling me a bitch. Probably because I was playing a female champ. I told him "shut up, kid" and he says he confirms they are 15 and asks me if I have my permit. This is when I start telling him he's immature and when I tell him I'm 21, of course he thinks I'm lying. He says "that'd be the age I'd say if I were lying" I told him to go ask his daddy what Glenlivet was. The community only bashes on the kids because they like to reveal that they are immature, rebellious, teenage pricks.
0	Well the bookstores only need as many books as the professor tells us they do, at my store we love to buy back from students, its cheaper for us than buying from the publishers (Who are the ones who screw us over.) and we give you half back on the new or used price depending on what you bought it as.   If we buy enough for our shelves, or no professor is using that book, we start offering ridiculously low amounts because since we don't need them, we send them back to the publisher, and the publisher gives us ridiculously low amounts.
0	Ditto.   I have no problem with single moms, single dads, or people who have no wish to parent other people's kids. I think it's great they have their feelings out in the open and are self-aware. Keep the wee ones away from them-- got it.   What gets me is the people who seem blind to the realities of single parenting, even when they know the situation.   For example, I need time to get a sitter, dudes. I can't just drop everything and go out with you. Don't assume there's anyone else in the picture that I can "unload" my kid on at a moment's notice.   Besides I prefer spending time with my kid to hanging out with some dude, 9/10.
0	1 for legit physics teachers!   I took 3 levels of physics classes with the same professor. Brilliant guy, but absent minded.  He'd sometimes write up notes on the bus, and then not be able to read what he wrote.  When he got to class, he would just derive all of the equations on the fly.   When I was taking my 3rd physics final (Relativity, quantum mechanics, nuclear, etc) I didn't have my "cheat sheet" that he let us bring in.  In a panic, I pulled out a sheet of paper and started to write down the equations I knew.  After a couple of minutes, I realized that I was deriving equations the same way Dr O did!  That clever bastard!
1	You know today wasn't a complete loss for Cloud9, they should at least be able to take away that a win is possible vs SKT. > If the team that played yesterday was the same, confident team that competed in the LCS, they might have been able to pull out a victory. C9 is a much better team than they give themselves credit for. Not saying they will ALWAYS dominate, but instead they would stand a chance on the worlds stage. >
1	What does that even mean? I like a new team that wins competitions. What a band wagoner! It's so much trendier to like lower tier teams? I was merely commenting on the fact that I think it's extremely unlikely.   Then again if I was a the league equivalent of a Cubs fan I'd probably be salty toward winning teams too.
1	I guess I agree with your point.  I just got bothered with the fact that someone can make a half-assed champion post that may or may not have anything unique, no scalings on abilities, and some aethestic things will get over 200 upvotes and front pages.  However, there are champions in there with appearance, lore, base and scaling stats, all spells that are clearly defined AND HAVE BALANCED NUMBERS/RATIOS (it bothers me so much when they say "X moderate damage), unique kits (for the most part), and even an explanation for play-style, like jungle routes, recommended items, etc, and they will get maybe 10 upvotes.  It just frustruates me.  TBH, I'd be happier if they just got rid of it and then required people to place a tag saying that it's a champion post, or the mods remove it.  That way, it could still show up on the 100,000+ subscriber subreddit, but RES could block out those that don't want it, and people who clearly showed a lot of creativity and effort get what they deserve.  I guess it sounds a little self-righteous, but its been bugging me lately with the amount of weak champion concepts that have been making the front page of the subreddit. /end rant
1	You are allowed to be associated with porn sites but not have their name, which is why they would do teamYP.   I dont think personal politics should weigh in here at all either. I dont like complexity as an organization, but love the team (or at least last splits). While the opposite is true for TSM, I like the brand, but not a huge fan of anyone but Dyrus on the actual team. Point being the brand and the team are usually pretty separate entities. SSW won but im not about to go buy a samsung phone becasue of it, i dont relate samsung really with their team.   As part of the young male population here, I acknowledge the potential negatives of porn and also think that comment is kinda sexist, considering many girls watch/read porn. I'm pretty sure my girlfriend does more than me, though we often watch together.   Final point being YouPorn and PornHub have shown that they are pretty cool companies, and I think many would much rather be associated with those companies than say, wal-mart, or BP, despite the industry. I respect both companies greatly even though I donlt use their sites (shout out to  PornMD ).   Sorry for the wall of text.
0	TO put it simply, when a government (or company for that matter) borrows money, it's to pay a bill that it already incurred.  Most transactions occur on credit, so they don't need to pay for a while.   So not raising the debt ceiling doesn't prevent them from spending more money, it prevents them from paying people they owe money to.   This now has a disastrous effect on the entire world.  The U.S. treasury has now defaulted on all it's outstanding debt (meaning, they can't pay their bills).  The effect on the US is fairly obvious.  But now the value of all US back securities/debt/notes/currency that other countries hold are now severely impaired.   To simplify that point: China owns (a made up number) $1 trillion in US debt.  It is now worth <$500 billion.  That means they are no longer worth as much any more, and they may risk defaulting on their debt.   And so on and so on.
1	Streamers as Role Models     I'll agree that streams are primarily about entertainment (as that's intrinsically linked to their profitability), but the overall demeanor of the professionals acts as a basic litmus test for the community as a whole. For somebody just learning about LoL, if they watch a streamer act like a jackass, that informs their initial judgements about LoL. This act of contextualization is important for how that individual might act if they decide to play. If success in LoL is seen as winning games (or at least not losing), and part of being a professional is an ability to win games, imitating professionals should be seen as linked.   For those not in the LoL scene, how professionals act is the fastest way to make judgements about the character of the players. People already complain about this game having a poor community, and poorly acting professionals will not assist.     LoL as a Major Sport     I don't know if the community wants LoL/eSports to become "Sport"y, but there is something to say about wanting the eSports scene to be respectable. For us the players, it helps to justify using our time in game. For the corporations involved, greater levels of respect will turn into a greater ability to advertise and, eventually, make money.
0	Because who's to say it's going to have a shitty life? You? When my sister was in the womb, the umbilical cord was wrapped around her neck at the one of the final ultrasounds. The doctors said she would most likely have some health issues because of it. So by OP's and your logic, we should've put her down like a fucking dog? Fuck you. My sister. was diagnosed with cerebral palsy at 2 years old. But for the last 12 years until her passing last May, my family and I loved her unconditionally and treated her no different because of her disability. You think pain and ridicule is the only thing she ever had? She had a smile that could bright up a room and a laugh that I will never ever forget. She made me the man I am today. While I am pro-choice, I would never think let's deny this baby it's right to life because of something it had no control over.
1	So what champion isn't viable when played well?   Pro players want safety, and if your support plays off that day they will feed horrendously on Janna. However if they play horribly on Thresh or Morgana, they can still make one clutch play late game and be useful, and that's with only their Q.   Janna can make some clutch plays with her ult, but there is also a champion who can make clutch plays with his ult while fitting the reactive support play style; IMO, Braum is a very similar champion to Janna, except for the fact that Braum is  way more safe  as he's stupidly tanky and targon's is really good.
1	Very few do, Most just sit around and wait for the pros to tell them a build works. Remember how shyvana was meh, And then she exploded because of M5?   You appear to be viewing starcraft with rose tinted glasses here. This is  exactly  how SC2 works aswell, as did BW. Infact this is how every community operates.   I really don't know what you are wanting to happen here. LoL isn't starcraft, there are no complex timings to work out, it's extremely obvious what the best builds are most of the time (I do play AD carry though which is perhaps the easiest to figure out in those terms). What I do agree is that actual ingame  tactics  are a very unexplored area of the game, and are only recently being developed with pro teams actually starting to time objectives properly and opt for certain strategies regarding them such as counter jungle / objective heavy gameplay.   Likewise it's very obvious which heroes are good at what for the most part. I also think you underestimate how much the pros theorycraft, Riot releases all the numbers for every champion. It's not uncommon to hear the phrase "doesn't scale well", if you weren't being so narrow minded yourself you might actually think what a phrase like that means. It means the actual bonuses the champion gets per level arn't good compared to other champions, the numbers are being worked out, and they don't match up.
0	I used to think this, so I did. I moved to a new city interstate, around 800kms from my hometown.   But it didn't solve anything. I suffer from Adjustment disorder (type of depression/anxiety, and have done since I was 17, 21 now), and thought that by moving my whole life entirely I'd move away from my stressor, find a new niche to start my life, and escape what had made me want to complete suicide in the past.   In the end, my roommates end up saving me from litterally the edge of suicide. I didn't know how to cope at the time, and I'm not entirely sure now, but at least I've gotten better - and discovered how to cope with life at large.
1	I've been looking over this issue for awhile now and so far here's a lengthy explanation of what I've found.   It's not for any single reason this is happening but is a result of Riot's multitude changes to towers, dragon gold, fb gold, passive gold gain, jungle changes and trinket timers. Most of these changes have been directed towards enforcing a laning meta, but almost all of them have had the opposite intended effect.   Making early gold worthless from FB (not worth a single item), and dragon while increasing dragon's damage makes risky plays for early games advantages a waste of resources. Pros don't even recommend flashing for early game kills anymore and since ignite was weakened and heal and barrier strengthened, it just makes the early game even duller.   Dragon is no longer worth contesting early game, increased damage, decreased gold, better vision control by both teams. So having 2 people bot is no longer an issue and having 2 top is often times more useful to the team.   Delaying trinket timers makes jungle harder to control since supports can no longer buy multiple early wards as they need to build up their early items to maximize late game gold generation. The trinket changes have made protecting your own buffs much more difficult so teams are lane swapping just to safely invade their own jungle and guarantee buffs for their own junglers.   Bot lane is inherently unbalanced, purple lane's tower is closer to the bushes and face a sight and zone disadvantage so purple adc+sup lane never wants to lane bot.   Moreover ADCs, due to successive nerfs have an even smaller impact early game but are still essential late game to kill turrets, so it makes more sense to safely farm up than risk getting shut down in lane.   Turrets having been buffed makes them harder to take. In the current meta waveclear champions are extremely important for turtling. Since sieging lategame is now so difficult when you have champions that can clear a wave safely from range, and kill champions from just a couple hits of poke, taking turrets during late-game sieges is impossible. Instead teams want early turrets, but taking turrets early game has gotten harder as well. The easiest way to take towers is for both teams to trade them and both teams want towers.   The early game is mostly worthless as early game advantages are so small at the pro level that a team can easily turtle till late game where everyone has six items, dissipating any early game item advantage. You can also no longer shut down a player by camping them with your jungler or snowballing your lane due to exponential experience rubberbanding. A good example of this is if you wait in-game long enough you can ding 1-18 in just a few seconds of being exposed to minions.   Tower changes work both ways for both teams, so individual changes on towers would be worthless, instead what needs to happen is an encouragement of other opportunities to bring focus away from tower-taking which are (because of nerfing of the value of other objectives) the most important objective early game and late game since you need to take towers to win. By incentivizing early game actions other than turret taking and making them meaningful, early game would be more interesting, but then this brings back bigger snowballing which Riot has been loathe about recently.
0	My friend from school has the best way of dealing with this type of awkward situation: When she realizes no one is listening anymore or everyone has lost interest she says at the end, "And then I found five dollars." Usually, for those who have not heard her say it a bazillion times (Me), people's reaction is like, "What?!" "Where?!" and they are completely re-interested in this new topic of how she found five dollars. Although, to me it's so watered down because she says it so much, I just get a kick out of the reactions people have who've never heard her say it before.
0	Also, stop voting strictly based on social issues. Who gives a crap who you're marrying, if you have no freedom and no money, you're not going to have a good time being married. Vote at local levels, and work your way up. Look out for your neighbors as you would family. Inform yourself daily on happenings in the world. And for the love of all things holy, inform yourself from more than one news source, AND THEN don't trust a thing you hear from any of them. Bought media is propaganda. Nazis, communists and dictators use/used propaganda to influence the people, if you think it's not happening to you right now, you are as blind and stupid as you think the other side is. I'm not saying that we're Nazi Germany, The USSR or anything like that. I'm saying we have the potential to head that direction, quickly (like anyone else does). Also, if you haven't taken the time to read/understand the Constitution, make that a priority. Aaaaand I sound like my crazy conspiracy-theorist Aunt. I need a beer.
1	The main reason those bots exist is the Refer a Friend system, and Riot has already stated that they will change it so people can no longer do it. Current system has unlimited invites, and gives rewards from IP, rune pages, RP, limited skins and such. The new system will limit invites to 5 people, and the rewards are 1000 per friend on lvl 10, at 3 friends you get a WW (I think it is Grey WW) skin and at 5 you get Medieval Twitch. Since the rewards are way smaller/easier, the bots will likely vanish. These changes should be in effect in less them a month, and this slight increase in bots are probably due to the scumbag exploiters trying to get a bit more out of the system.
1	I think it's more about the people you play the game with, some are competive and like winning, others play for fun. It's all random who you queue up with, example: "Yesterday I decided to solo (yolo) queue and ran into some nice people. During champ select someone mentioned that we had so many animal champs (or in the kit). So we decided to stick with that and unleashed the zoo upon summoner's rift. We lost quite hard, but had fun all the time. After the match we went on for another round, this time with birds, like previous game: load, get stomped, still fun" 10/10 would play with these guys again.   Other times like you mentioned, the game can be frustating and exhausting for some people. Or you get trolls/feeders that just ruins the game. Some people set goals for themself, maybe get to the next league or tier, or simply master a new champ. You should set goals for yourself and always play to win, but this is a game, and games are supposed to be fun, so remember that.   Also, you should try finding some other people playing just for fun, there are a lot of them out there. Same with different game modes (bravery or protect the soraka/teemo). Or simply take a small break, play something else, then come back.
1	I know Riot wants the skin to be something people will actually use, but they start working on it fairly early (pretty sure it's in production right now), so it's going to be a champion that they predict will have enduring popularity. This means they've seen a lot of use in solo queue and competitive during the spring/summer splits (Janna wasn't used much end of S2 but was extremely popular mid-season), probably with a good winrate and a kit that just works even if the numbers are tuned a bit too low at some point. In my opinion, the list of probable candidates is:   Caitlyn, Leona, Sona, Lux, Fizz, Renekton, Hecarim, Wukong, Fiddlesticks, Jax, Tristana, Nasus, Kayle, Malphite, Jayce, Elise, Khazix, Ryze, Diana, Vayne, TF. Give or take a few random champs.   They're probably going for variety, so top/jungle and support are less likely, and they seem to go with "good" champions. Fizz feels too aloof and Renekton, Hecarim, Fiddlesticks, Elise, and Khazix feel too evil. Beach Babe Leona is in production already, so she's probably out as well, and Diana has an unkown skin in the works that could possible be Victorious, though I'm inclined to believe lore-wise (implying a total victory over the Solari) that it's not. Malphite's pretty boring, and he and Nasus both seem ill-fitted thematically. Wukong's only mildly popular and more annoying than glorious.   That leaves Caitlyn, Sona, Lux, Jax, Jayce, Tristana, Kayle, Ryze, Vayne, and TF. None of the AD carries seem a great fit, but it'll be Vayne if it's one of them because she actually fights darkness. I know Silver Bolts is considered kind of poor design, but it does give her the power to come back into relevance again and again. Jax and Jayce are both excellent candidates, and while I don't think Riot would pigeonhole themselves into J champs, both work extremely well thematically. Ryze has a billion skins already which shows that Riot's not averse to making more, but he's already Triumphant, so Victorious isn't likely. Of the rest (Lux, Kayle, and TF), TF seems a bit too much of a renegade, while Lux and Kayle are squeaky-clean and excellent candidates.
0	I once went into a Dunkin Donuts to use their restroom. I go to open the mens room door, it opens to a middle-aged man sitting on the toilet with this blank stare on his face. We caught eyes and I immediately shut the door.   The entire time I was thinking "If you're taking a shit, why would you not lock the door. It usually takes some time. If He was taking a piss it wouldnt have been a big deal. But he was taking a fucking shit."
0	Yes, in some cases that is the case.  But if he had a DNA test done come back and they are not his there is a very good chance he will not have to pay.   Signing the birth certificate really doesn't matter.  The bigger point is how long he has raised them and if they are or are not married.   I tried a case several years ago and the court found the "father" to not have to pay child support after a DNA test came back and said the child was not his.  The child was 18 months.   I assumed when I was commenting the DNA tests was done within a reasonable time after birth.
1	please boycott the EU LCS this weekend.  By that I mean dont watch it or the VOD's.   I am a fnatic fan and this is absolutely disgusting the disregard to the integrity of the sport.   It is beyond unfair to make a team play four subs because Riot is unable to schedule the games properly.   I BEG YOU RIOT GAMES PLEASE DONT TURN THE LCS INTO A JOKE WHICH IS WHAT YOU ARE DOING RIGHT NOW WITH THIS ACTION.
1	Riven doesn't fit well into any team comps, because she's not a bruiser. AD assassins go mid lane, and she does the job worse than Zed/Kha'Zix/Jayce/Pantheon. You can run her mid, but it's risky.   Top lane is for people who build Sunfire into Warmog's into Randuin's. Has been for a long time in competitive play. You get the occasional team running Rumble, but for the vast majority, it's Shen/Olaf/Jax/Singed/Irelia or bust.   Riven is snowbally, but nowhere near as snowbally as Olaf, Elise, Darius or Jax. An Olaf with a lead will force you out of lane, sustain your tiny damage with his in-built sustain (and 7.0 (+0.9) HP5) and just build pure tank, run into teamfights and fuck all your squishies with a 320 true damage nuke every 3 seconds while being immune to CC.   There was no justification for the nerf - she was neither overpopular, nor overpowered. It feels like a grudge nerf - some designer at Riot didn't like Riven 6 months ago, before Darius, Rengar, Elise and Jayce were released and finally managed to convince someone that Riven was totally OP at his ELO (1200).
0	Return the favor, but not maliciously.  It's really hard to explain.  One accidentally snuck out of my SO at the time during the worst possible moment, the worst possible moment!  We just laughed because it killed the mood.  It didn't gross me out, just blew my hair back a lil.  My point is is; you have to be comfortable with who you are, and the person you are opening up to (hopefully they will be comfortable with you as well).   Now back to returning the favor.  There is, of course, the dutch oven (needs no explanation).  The "I swear I'm awake release" where you smile, snuggle your SO and let go of everything.  There is also "scoop and feed" but that is best done betwixed bros with serious braggadocio of the stench.  The subtle lean to the "side and let it slide" is my  specialty (sitting on the sofa and my knee hurts and needs to be stretched?  Yeah, its not my knee! I often "have knee problems" with the knee not next to her just so I can lean to that side and let one fly).  The last method I can think of is pretty devious, and has come back to bite me (I shampooed every seat in her car).  In a car on a road trip let it go, force it out if necessary(where I ran into trouble) and make sure the windows are UP, then open their window so all of the gas has to pass them on the way out.

Let me break it down for you so that you can quit puking up identity/victim political dogma: 1. There are racist, discriminatory people of every race, gender, age, creed, ethnicity, national origin located all over the world. 2. Some of them will give you a hard time for no reason at all, other than they just don't like you for some accidental reason, i.e. your skin color or maybe the color of your shirt. 3. Some people won't like you because they're jerks. 4. Some people won't like you because you're a jerk. 5. In the end, if the negative people make you feel bad about yourself, it's because YOU are weak-minded. 6. Most of the time, your personal successes and failures are just that: personal. There isn't some bogey man keeping you down or lifting you up.
0	When we were dating, I forgot my (now) husband was lactose intolerant. It was cold out so I made us some hot coco with milk. Not only did he get very sick but he can no longer drunk hot coco with water like he used to because he knows what he is missing.
0	I see. If you are surrounded by professionals with lots of opinion, what solution can you give for your fellow students who just graduated with zero experience if you think volunteering is not a good move?
1	This was happening to me too earlier (maybe a month or so ago?) I would finally get in at maybe 45 sec, sometimes even 1:30! It seems to have stopped, maybe a bug with the current patch? My ping was always normal (usually around 70-90) Or Frames would be like 0-3 for the first 30 seconds of being in base, it would never happen after the initial start of the game though, it was odd.
1	I think they should add the timer on when you tab their score, if they recently put their trinket down or no. Yes, its gets hard ganking when the enemy gets lvl 9 (2min free ward), but by that time the laningphase has already ended. I would not recommend playing counterjunglers in S4. Shaco took all my wraiths and golems and I took like 2 of his wraiths and I came in the lead over the enemy Shaco. He was just annoying and there's no snowballing UNLESS you have your Ancient item.   I think that jungler's that have it bad early will slowly come back again. In that category belongs Amumu,Maokai,Skarner,Shen,Mundo,Trundle,Hecarim,Nautilus and Rammus cause of the new jungle changes.
1	Mobas are like 80 percent experience and 20 percent skill  something something remember the name  Unless you are like gods gift to league, more then likely you will suck really bad. And that's ok because majority of us started off that way. Your best bet if you want to get better is just learn different champions by playing them in a bot game or dominion to learn how they work. Once you get a basic understanding of how a few champions work, move onto learning what different items do for a few of those champions you learned about. Then learn the basic terminology and what certain words mean. Example "red buff, blue buff, Cs  creep score , gank, dragon or drake, Baron or Nashor, MIA or SS   If you can obtain the basic knowledge of the game without your head exploding, the mechanics/skill part will take care of its self as you learn to make good decisions and bad, like i said it's mostly about experience  when learning this game.
1	Of course he is going to hurt when he uses tiger.  He has no range so they have to make him a terror to get close to.  And if he maxes tiger he will have no sustain and can easily be ganked.  Why change it to Physical damage?  This is what makes Udyr diverse and hard to play against.  Might as well make Warwick's hungering strike physical as well then.

0	I used to work in the back shop at a 36 hole golf course when I was younger and tried this. Worked what was called the ironman, 5am-10pm by myself running carts, cleaning clubs and refilling the driving range for both courses on one of the busiest non-tournament days of the year. They were so relieved because usually during the holidays it is hard to find anyone who is willing to work, even for time and a half. However, they told me a week after I was not eligible for time and a half because I volunteered to work. Tried to fight it, became too big of a hassle as they were cutting down my shifts and giving me less golf privileges.
1	best thing that ever happend to me!
0	Just an example. I know they have, and I actually like a lot of their songs.  I Want To Break Free  and the video is funny and abstract. I see how you don't vibe with the music.   It takes patience to know when to get reactions and when not; that's rhetoric. Being touchy, you might know how people like to take reactions from you. The easiest way to stop that from happening is to stop the cycle and use your rhetorical ability for good and not uselessness.
0	Yeah... that's still awful advice. Panicking people in water are REALLY strong, and can drag you under even in situations that are much safer than in the ocean, i.e. in a calm pool. Story time:   I used to be a swimming instructor, and one day I was teaching a class of 8-9 year olds how to swim in the deep part of the pool. They all had lifejackets on, etc. I was taking one of them out, when he decided that he was going to freak out and think he was drowning. This kid who was probably half my weight dunked me under the water faster than I would have believed. I'm not even a weak swimmer: I've swam in national competitions, and the kid was wearing a lifejacket in a calm pool. And you want to tell me it'd be safe to rescue someone from the ocean? NOOOOOOOOPE.
1	Apparently some people don't get it so I'll elaborate.   Ranked solo queue is bad for a number of reasons.  Here are just a few:     You get a meaningless rating.  And no, no,  no , it's meaningless because League of Legends is a team game.  You might be able to carry teams of random people but you will always lose to a coordinated team with planned strategies, even if they are less skilled.  Your solo queue rating is nothing more than an e-peen measurement.  Get over yourselves.  Even if you make it to 2700+ you are still probably not professional team level.  People may not watch your stream unless you can create good content for them.  And that doesn't just mean being good at the game.   There's no prize for 1st place.  People might see your name but the price you pay in getting it far outweighs the actual value from what I've heard.  Maybe the average person will look at the rankings and say hey you must be pretty good.  They'll likely move on pretty quickly.  It's not that big of a deal unless you're interesting enough to hold their attention.   It's very accessible to all level 30 players.  You're going to get just as many trolls (if not more), just as many leavers (if not more), and a fair amount of casuals when you queue for ranked.  Many of you will tell yourself and claim to others that you're playing ranked because you're serious about winning.  Again, get over yourselves.  If you want to truly play this game seriously and competitively, forming a 5v5 team is the only real option.   You are taking League of Legends way too seriously.   I mean it.  It's a game.  You are likely not playing with $2,000,000 in prizes on the line.  You are likely not backed by sponsors who want to see results from your practice.  You are probably some random guy sitting at his computer who wants to show off 1800+ ELO.  You might want to get there one day.  And that's fine.  That's absolutely great if you do.  But you're going to lose along the way.  Your expectations probably won't bet met.  If you want it so badly that you're going to get frustrated and flame your teammates for not being as skilled as you are, then I have a simple suggestion for you:  Pretend to be a really cute girl and get a pro to duo queue with you (Sorry girls, I don't like it either but it's a proven method).  It's easier, less frustrating, and (is now) semi-permanent.  Winning isn't everything.  You usually gain more from a loss than from a win.  Deal with it.  Have fun when you play.  That's not a "casual gamer's" mentality.  It's that of a sane person.   Solo Queue is not a competitive game mode.  I've been saying it and now I'll say it again.  You are going to get trolled.  You are going to get people you can't carry.  If you join a 5v5 team however, you will likely not get trolled.  If you do, you just kick him from the team or join another one!  Your teammates will probably be on your level or close.  Easy!   Solo queue is a learning experience first.  You might want to win, most people do, but [Doublelift himself says]( that it's mainly about making yourself better.  The best way to play solo queue is to learn from your mistakes and make observations, regardless of the game's outcome.   There are only a few major differences between Ranked Solo Queue and Normal Draft Queue:  You don't have a visible rating in Normal.  You only have Solo and Duo queues in Ranked but you can run into Triple/Quadra queues in Normal.  5 man queues are usually matched with other 5 man queues.  "There are more casuals in Normal queue" - it's sort of a valid point, but again in Solo Queue the only way to consistently win is to carry.  There are always ways to improve.  There is nothing you can't do in Normals that's exclusively available in Ranked Solo/Duo.
0	What would really prepare them for college:   Not have enough class space for required course only offered in once a year, that you will have to take next to graduate on time. Force you to take summer online class. No lecture, no notes, no homework, only final and midterm, and book. Charge same tuition.  Expect you to know stuff that wasn't in prerequisite (makes course only 6 weeks instead of full semester, but still 'cover' same material and a little extra). Makes test harder to make up for lack of lecture ("It's a self paced course that has no lecture, so you should be spending more time outside of class studying than if it wasn't online"). Professor becomes short tempered when students have poor midterm grades, Blames student's study habits.
1	CLG needs more ''threats''.   When it comes to teamfighting, you gotta have some people that can actually be a threat to the enemy team. People that do dmg. People that are farmed and dangerous for the enemy or people that are so disruptive that they can't be ignored.     A high dmg output champion (akali, zed, xin, rumble etc) is a threat.     A fed champion (because you are a very good laner and you outplay your opponent or because your team is that good that reliefs pressure from your lane by wrecking the others or because your jungler is a god) is a threat too.       In other words: it is about the Pick itself, the ability of the player to get fed and last but not least your team's ability/organisation/strat.   When it comes to CLG, I observe the following problems:     TOP LANE: tanky/supportive champions that are usually used for initiation/disruption/peeling.  not a threat     MID LANE: rich champion pool but i just feel that none of them are truly mastered in order to be threats. In other words, Link usually doesn't lose his lane but he isn't the playmaker/ game changer type of player either.  kind of a threat     JUNGLE: When Chauster started jungling for CLG I could see a threat. But not anymore. I don't know what happened there.  was a threat, not anymore.     BOT LANE: (was) CLG's strongest lane. When Chauster and DL were bot, all the big teams were trembling. DL's talent + Chauster's deep knowledge of the game made this lane CLG's ONLY threat.   not as big of a threat as before but still a threat .       I can roughly count 1,5 threats for CLG atm. Now just think of the LoL monsters (TPA,WE,GG,Frost-Blaze,KTR etc) and count the threats..  Playing against them is not like: ''Ok guys, shut the AD player down and it is over''.   The meta has shifted. Supportive champions at Top/Jungle (even support!! eg Elise) are left behind and high dmg champions have taken their place. CLG needs to change their playstyle.( EG is doing it too btw...)   Woah! Sorry for the long post.   PS : I didn't even take into account the continuous roster changes.   PS2 : Did they need all those things to beat Vulcan? No, but they are pretty emotionally destroyed atm and if you don't play at your 100%, you will lose to everyone.
0	You are both wrong and right at the same time. Are you American? Just curious. If not I can understand the cause for confusion over the term African American. It was never meant to be taken in a literal sense. It is simply an ethnic term for the descendents of African slaves brought to America.   Cultural oppression was just as important to slavery as the physical oppression. Slaves came from a variety of places with different cultures in West Africa, but keeping many traditions were forbidden by slave owners. Present day descendents of these slaves are referred to as African Americans because it provides historical and geographical context. The term negro used to be used but it was seen as outdated.   And of course all black people aren't African American because that would be like saying all white people are Italian, but you already knew that.
1	If you are like me and have multiple League accounts. Make sure to sign out of your other account. The first time you change your password, it keeps you logged into that account. So when you go to change your 2nd account password, it has you trying to change your first account password.
1	Perhaps because it takes 4 seconds of foresight or a skirmish lasting 4+ seconds in the same area for the damage part of the ult to even apply?   That and one of the only guaranteed damage setups requires the use of an entire item activation (zhonyas) which, after a week, will be an obvious bait that people will stop falling for or be aware of when playing against him. #
1	I have the solution. Please don't tell Riot about this(I don't want them to steal my multi-billion dollar idea). For the last two years I've been working on a solution to make the in- game chat less toxic. I've developed an in-game button called the 'ignore™' button. It is not hard to use, if someone is toxic, you press TAB then search for the 'ignore™' button next to their name. If you press it then you won't see what horrible things they want to say to you. Sounds awesome right? (it is still in development so you might notice some bugs) I'm also thinking about a way to 'report™' these toxic players, so a system (I was thinking about a system called the 'Tribunal™') can punish them.
1	Remember some of my games as xerath. i played him pretty ok for the first 30 matches. ok k/d. regular flash/ignite. nothing special. Then when i got better i decided to switch out ignite cause i usually wasnt in range for it anyways depending on the enemy mid pick. I picked tp - people flamed. I picked cleanse - people flamed. I picked barrier - people told me to use ignite. (in most of the games i were fed btw. or at least won my mid). Then i started using cv. Why not? My biggest problem were that the enemy junglers always ganked me and my map awarness was too bad so i took cause whenever it was up i could help my team with vision or simply know if the enemy jungler is coming to kill me and also i would learn to watch at my minimap more often. Used it 3 times. got 10/3 in like every game. Carried everygame. "Report Xerath for Troll Summoner Spells" at the end of every single game.
1	People always say that, but no one knows how well Hai would play support.   Yeah lemonnation isn't prime madlife when it comes to mechanics, but support isn't really a position you can just plug and play.   There are tons of lane matchups, lane swaps, wave control, roams, warding to learn. We cant just assume Hai would be some upgrade just because of shot calling.   He may be a good shot caller from mid because of how much vision of the map you get.
0	Cashier here. We can still see what you purchase in the self checkout. There is a screen set up that shows what everyone is scanning and after you leave, we tell our coworkers about the funny stuff we see.   To top it off, people do not know how to scan their items. I've seen people try and scan their items in the most ridiculous ways. Like seriously, when have you ever seen a cashier rub the item on the scanner until it scans?
0	There is nothing "wrong" with your choice. The oijnt I made was that she was in the same boat as you. She never wanted to date somebody with kids. She didn't tell me that, becsusrcshe never thought I had one. So by the time I told her I did, she had fallen for me, she loved me, not the superficial onkibd dating world crap.  After that point,,me having a kid wasn't as important as she thought it was st the beginjng.
1	I find the design to be fairly enjoyable compared to others. I find it quite amusing to see players here picking on fizz and saying he's OP, rather than Syndra, malzahar, or veigar. The amount of burst they have is far higher than fizz, and can 100 to 0 people even harder than fizz. Everytime that syndra lands that stun with insanely huge width and range, then lands a second Q and ult, makes me want to cry. Not to mention the insanely low cooldown on her Q and E makes it practically impossible to avoid getting hit. I always ban syndra. I never ban fizz. The margin of safetydistance you need against a syndra is far higher than a fizz. Sure they may not have an 'escape' against junglers like fizz. but for fizz to actually be useful, he has to all in. And that frame of all-in can be abused extremely hard by junglers.
0	Actually, it should be "Mag er mich nicht?" which in a word to word translation meanst "Likes he me not?". The sentence begins with the verb "Like" since it is a question (English does something similar by putting a "do" at the beginning of a question) and putting a "not" at the end is just how the Germans negate (compared to the English way of adding a "do not" before the verb).
1	The rage is that they are trying to get popularity for the sole reason that they have boobs.  They aren't pros, they don't bring anything new to the table, all they are doing is making up a stereotype that people really didn't make a big deal about until now.  Had they done all this when they were say a top 20 team, they would be Heros, but they didn't so they just look like attention whores now.
1	Evo is still around. Atlanta left mTw.na because he didn't like top lane after Balls switched to ad carry, so they were trying new people out. Aphromoo left TSM.evo because he thought the team (except for Wingsofdeathx) were taking practice seriously enough. So, mTw.na picked up Aphromoo, with Balls going back to top lane. Around while this was going on TD kicked Nintendudex and picked up Atlanta as their new jungler.   But then TSM.evo needed a new ad carry, so they picked up DontMashMe, who left Monomaniac, which was pretty much a sinking ship after Patoy left to be the support for Dignitas (who needed a new support after cutting L0cust after their poor OGN Summer performance).

1	They have a chance, but not a serious chance. They have the Ravens, Patriots, Broncos and Texans in the AFC that are better. And then the NFC is full of SB contenders with San Francisco, Seattle, Green Bay, and Atlanta all improving their already stacked rosters.
1	Let me start with: I don't like Athene. But all of us, including you are doing everything to help him out. Maybe he really is a persona and actually is a nice guy and just pretends to be a jerk to piss off some people. The truth is everyone, including you with your post just now, is supporting him. He makes those controversial videos like the one where he claims to stop streaming and such so people would making him more popular. Yes he looks like a clear *sshole but thats fine with him and his cause because we all talk about it. And us talking about it makes him more popular. People who don't know athene read your post about him, and see how other people hate him too and they will look him up. And this way he got known by other people. And this keeps on going the more people rampage about him on reddit and forums and all the other media. If everyone would just ignore him and let him be where he is and ignore how much of an ass he is just report him after a game with him. Simple as that he would just fade away into the nothingness :)
1	People are saying having a jungler is bad, now because its so hard to jungle and clear the camps etc. The thing is, its still very worth it to have a jungler, because you can still contest dragons as well as pressure other lanes.   So while there is a 2-1-2 on the other team, I'm gonna be happy to be jungling. This gives my top laner solo xp to outlevel the others, while at the same time I can snowball mid, deny enemy jungle buffs, take dragons and get my own XP.   The reason the jungle is harder is because the camps give less XP and have more health. The reason this is the case is because Riot wanted to reduce early game snowballing due to the "buff -> buff -> gank" strategies every single game. Junglers were generally strong early, and could use that to send the game into an immediate snowball and win. If they didn't they would generally fall off and start receiving less gold because they can't get an acceptable amount of money farming the jungle, and can't succeed at ganks because they're too weak.   With 3.14, they increased the amount of gold you can get in the jungle throughout the game, so that they can stay relevant by farming the jungle. I'm totally fine with the jungle difficulty, and I hope it discourages enemy teams to do their 2-1-2 and let me be more relevant than ever.

0	There are way, way stupider posts on Reddit every single day. This doesn't even make the list.     "Ooh, anybody who talks about sex must be 13." No. Sex is interesting and fun, and adults can be immature sometimes. Nothing wrong with that.     A knowledge test? Really? First of all, restricting or even slowing down signups at all is totally against the spirit of Reddit. Second, testing knowledge would in no way guarantee the maturity of applicants, because those things are barely correlated. But even if they WERE analogous, this is a website. On the internet. Any knowledge test would end up being a "can you use Wikipedia" test.       There, that's three problems, and the last one can be divided up into three itself, for a total of five.
0	This is something I've realized has to do with maturity. I went into accounting. Did I want to at the time? No, but I realized I was almost guaranteed a full time position out of school if I kept my GPA up and networked. Eventually, I realized that I actually DO like accounting and there are many many things I can do with my major. It's all paid off now that I have a full time under my belt.
0	This happened to me all the time with a particular friend, until one day I called him out on it. He got pissed and said it was his house and kicked me out. I started crying and got on my bike to ride home (I was about 8). As I pulled out of his drive way, the two neighbor dogs ran out of the house and started chasing me, barking and growling. So I rode home as fast as I could, crying and being chased by scary as fuck dogs.
0	A few years ago my gf and I were driving down I-5, just pass corvallis cut off and I'm doing 80ish in a 65, mind you its like 1am on a weekday and there is nobody out. I'm in the fast lane because I don't feel like switching lanes every mile or so for the 1 car.   Suddenly this guy flys up on my ass, and flicks his high beams at me, I look up, pull over to the slow lane and he flys past me... $#!*! that was a cop, wtf, ok i'll go 65 for a little bit... 10 minutes pass, f-it back up to 80 in the fast lane... Guy flys up on my ass and high beams me again, pull over and BOOM another cop. WTF again. Do the same thing keep it at 65 for a little and then back up to speed, this happened one more time... I'm seriously freaked out, what the hell could be going on? a few more miles I get behind like 6-8 cop cars traveling in a pack taking up both lanes doing about 55 mph, I'm kinda scratching my head, when the 2 cop cars infront of me slow down and then lock up the brakes stopping I-5 feet infront of me, the ~4 other cops pull a pit type manouver and pull this s-10 over, seems like they ripped the door off and yank this guy out of the car. While 2 SUV cop cars come flying up the shoulders of the road.... WTF is going on, this is straight out of a movie...I sit, it clears up, traffic goes, over the next over pass I see a cop car packing stuff into his trunk(assuming spike strips), and more cops sitting on the on ramps...   I watch the news and newspapers the next few days... not a single word about it. There was easily 12 cops involved, country, state, who knows what else.
1	Evelynn: Hate Spike hits all enemy units in range, instead of a single spike, each spike procs W independently.   Morgana: All enemies standing on Tormented Soil have their armor and MR reduced by 1/2/3/4/5 every second until they step off the soil. Support Morgana OP.   Karthus: Once Wall of Pain is placed, it can be switched into either of 2 forms, either a pass-able slow gate like it already is, or un-passable train, like anivia's or trundles.   Udyr: Upon activating Bear Stance, all enemies behind you in a small range are feared for 0.5s.
1	Has the "Loss Forgiven" been completely forgotten by Riot?   I had a friend playing a ranked game, and 9 of the players disconnected simultaneously. The one lone guy pushed down 3 towers before the opposing team returned. They then quickly killed the lone guy and pushed all the way back to win the game, all before the 20 minute mark. (To point out, my friend was in the winning team.)   Because of these circumstances I decide to look into if the losing team got "loss forgiven". But alas, they received a normal defeat, accompanied by a nice loss of ELO (thanks lolking.com for the info!).   Not five minutes later, Riot have posted a forum thread about the issue and put the notification in the launcher that the problem is already being worked on. Now correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't this Exactly what the "loss forgiven"-button was designed for? It's been ages since I saw it used now, and given the Major issues on EUW I'd really expect to see it more often.
0	I took a world masterpieces class where the teacher was also the Dean of students, there was only like 8 of us in the class. He gave us a "study guide" that was 6 pages of nothing but questions on whatever book we read. The "study guide" was word for word the same exact test. Easiest fucking tests ever, the only hard part was writing out the answers that had to be in complete sentences.   On the flip side I had a 300 series honors comp teacher who made us use the full three hour time to take the final. Comprehensive over all 7 books we read and whatever else we did but only five questions that we had to relate to all those things, hand written in two of the blue books , each answer had to be at least 4 pages. I literally started 10 minutes before class and had to rush to finish 10 minutes after.
1	Riot, please  do not  nerf Brutalizer or any bruisers. We don't need it.   Guys, stop complaining about every single thing that changes every single patch. Learn to adapt. We keep complaining about a stale meta, and what happens when we're forced to adapt to a new meta?  We fucking complain about it endlessly.   Learn to adapt and try sending your AP mids elsewhere, try shifting lanes around, or try completely breaking the laning meta. There are the few weeks out of the  entire year  where we can gimmick as much as we want and receive minimal backlash from our teammates;  take advantage of it  or stop complaining at all.
1	But its impossible to say, right now the koreans are nearly finished their season, and have been in the spotlight since worlds. I mean you have players like froggen who is easily a better player (Imo) than xpeke and pretty close to faker/cool but because his team was much weaker we haven't gotten to see him verse these top Asian mids in a while. SKT never really played any of the best western teams at worlds... they were given a hard time by ozone before worlds and we know what happened when they played fnatic/gambit so using that logic is silly.   Most pro's say a lot of things, before worlds everyone was saying that the EU teams were by far the weakest, dade said no western team could touch them etc. I wouldn't take everything pro players say as gospel. It is a shame KTB weren't at worlds tho, because they are an incredible team.   The way professional league of legend's tournaments are structured just doesn't lend itself well to the whole top player thing. We only get to see the different regions play against each other once or twice a year and even then we don't always get to see the best teams from each region there or play against each other because of the format.   If you were to organise the regions into which are the strongest, i would agree that Korea > China > Europe > NA last season, but that doesn't really equal to them having the best players. More that they had the best infrastructure (Obviously they had a lot of the best players too), they all had gaming houses and coaches whereas most European teams didn't have gaming house etc   That has changed in the last few months tho, and in general the teams from the west have gotten much stronger on paper, we just haven't got to see them in action like the Korean teams because of the different schedules.
0	why is it OK to put your own desires to biologically reproduce before the welfare of another person, say, the child you will create?   First of all, I think that you're oversimplifying the reasons that people have children.  Ideally, the motivation is not just a desire to "biologically reproduce": it's a desire to have a child and  raise him or her to be happy , to be a part of a loving family.  Of course people should consider the welfare of their children before having them, but to say that a disabled person or a "person with an abnormality" is incapable of doing that is to completely forget how multifaceted life is and how many various components go into being "happy".  Having an illness/disability does not automatically guarantee a life of misery, nor does genetic health guarantee the opposite.  In fact, some people with disabilities accomplish tremendous feats and experience happiness/love to an extent some able-bodied people never know.  These things depend on a whole lot more than your genetics.   Should people consider the fact that genetic illness exists in their family before having children? Of  course  they should...do you ever think that they willfully  don't ?  However, what I'm saying is that the eugenics argument- this idea that we can determine which lives  are  and  are not  worth living and create a restrictive system to impose that idea on everyone- is a backwards/unsustainable way of thinking.   Like I said, there's nothing wrong with having your own opinion on this matter, but thinking you can force your opinion on everyone else is not right.  Many people with genetic illnesses will reach the same conclusions as you; other people with genetic illnesses will decide to have children, and that's fine too.  Some people  without  genetic illnesses will have children and, for one reason or another, the children will be unhappy.  It really isn't black and white at all.
0	I was doing delivery for a bit and it was really monotonous.  It was really silly what they expected of me.  I drove a long route each day, took a while to re-stock inventory at each account.  Every day I was working 30 minutes longer than I was getting paid for.  I told them this.  They gave me that look that suggested that if I pursued what I was saying, I would be fired.  I really wish I could remember the details, but basically their point was I get to drive 30-45 minute at a time, so I shouldn't be taking 15 minute breaks.  My thought process was, because the boss was kind of an ass, that I would crash the company vehicle if I took a break while I was driving.  (I know that's kind of passive, but whatever)   I'm pretty sure the details were that I was supposed to take a hour lunch break.  I had this sent to me via a text message from the manager.  It was basically that I worked 8am to 5 pm with a one hour lunch break.   It was 100% impossible to finish the job, and be back to the warehouse by 5pm if I literally took a one hour lunch break.  I worked fast and was efficient, I even kept a time log for a while of my driving, unpacking and stocking inventory.  My warehouse manager couldn't leave until I returned, so he asked how long I was taking for lunch, and I said an hour.  So he said I was only supposed to be taking 30 minute lunches, to which I showed him the text he sent me months before about taking an hour lunch.  He said oops, and then I started only taking 30 minute lunches, so technically was working 30 minutes more each day, but not getting paid for it.  When I confronted them, I was basically told tough shit.  I quit.   Before quitting, and when the warehouse manager and the owner thought it was strange that I wasn't getting back before 5 pm (they had hoped that I would be back by 4pm and have about 45 minutes to an hour to work in the warehouse and maybe start prepping the next day's deliveries.  The manager came with me one day, and we got back by 5pm.  He said, see it can be done by 5 pm.  I could not understand why he didn't realize the only reason we were back by 5pm was because he was helping me that day, AND our lunch break was a drive through and eating while driving, so we really didn't stop.   I'm sorry, but if my title is delivery driver, then driving is part of my job, and I'm not "taking my break" while I'm driving.  I took advantage of my hour lunch break, I would usually do reading for college classes on my iPad or even homework a few times.   I'm sure they hired some idiot that was willing to be a bitch for 12 bucks an hour after I left.
1	Teemo honestly just seemed like a troll pick by Hai because he was that confident they would stomp TSM, it worked because TSM lost the game due to losing inner bot turret after 3(?) minutes and thus surrendered their blue, dragon and basically anything on the bottom half of the map.  All that after getting completely destroyed in picks and bans... when Hai picked a fucking TEEMO they still outpicked TSM!   C9 usually wins games by having superior rotations and being in the right places at the right times by controlling the map.  TSM surrendered the map after that utterly botched 3v1 lane where they zoned (badly as Balls still got XP) instead of pushed as hard as possible to give C9 second thoughts about pushing on to the inner turret.  Teemo then was able to place a frankly hilarious number of shrooms, they might as well ahve been in a smiley face on the map as they weren't even needed, the IDEA of shrooms was enough to keep TSM in base after 20 mins.  If Hai picked a stronger mid champ it would've been "gg easy" in under half an hour as opposed to the torturous inevitability of the strangle game.

1	Gleeb isn't an obvious upgrade, but he's an upgrade, otherwise he wouldn't have been chosen.   That's circular logic, just because he's chosen doesn't mean he's necessarily an upgrade. It could be the case that Regi is wrong about Gleeb and he isn't an upgrade.   This conversation boils down the "potential" vs. the facts we do have available. Could Gleb's synergy with Wild make them amazing? Maybe. But we do know that Xpecial/Wild were already a top tier bot lane that only were rivaled by CLG and C9's bot lane and they rarely lost lane to them.   Could Gleb play the same initiation role that Xpecial did? Maybe, but Xpecial is a top 2 if not the top tier NA support last split.   Could others step in to fill those gaps? Maybe, but from what I've read, Amazing wasn't the shotcaller of Wolves and Xpecial had at least some influence in calls.   The
0	Because, (as a cop) I can tell you that anyone can lose it for a minute.. I never have, but one time I chased a guy down and he fought me like crazy, he was stronger than me, and very motivated to hurt me. ..  I finally got him cuffed and rage took over and i wanted to punch him,,, but i did not.. .something in me stopped me... and i remembered my oath...   Had i punched him in a fit of rage or adrenaline.. should i be fired? Arrested, lose my job, my house, my family?   Sadly, too many redditors would say yes...    Any other job, you would get retraining, or counseling.. hell, you can come on reddit and talk about smoking crack and get upvotes.. but if a cop makes a mistake he should be exiled to working as a garbage man.   All cops have had a moment like i did, and they think, "that could have been me".   I once was rolling around with a guy, he was found in an alley outside a bar having sex with a girl who was high on ecstasy and coke and had NO IDEA what she was doing.. her friends boyfriend found them and it got real fun...  the guy did not want to go to jail and the fight was on..   he was trying to punch me, he spit in my face, and he tried to kick me in the nuts...  I am trying to get his hands behind his back, protect my nuts, and make sure he can't get to my gun.     Let me tell you something, fighting isnt like on TV... its nasty, on the ground, biting, kicking, etc..        Anyway, I try to taser the guy, and I look down at the last minute and i have my regular gun drawn... even though the taser is yellow and the gun black/blue, and even though they are on different sides of the belt, i pulled the wrong object... thank goodness I realised it, a cop in San Francisco did not, and he went on trial for his life...
1	I've absolutely had some frustrating games but I never rage at my teammates. It sounds silly but I try to explain out loud what I'm doing and my reasoning for it out loud to myself sometimes. It helps me to REALLY think some of the decisions through and, should something bad happen while I'm doing this, I can understand what is happening and why so much easier.   I can't say I don't trust any of my teammates. I main ADC and while I don't trust very many of my supports... I do try to trust the rare support who is actively in chat and wants to know how I intend to play and announce what they will be doing to help me. If they communicate early, I find that I can trust them so much more. They allow the opportunity to build confidence in them and more often than not it can be rewarding for both of us.   I do agree that most of the time I try to focus on what I can do personally to give us an advantage over the other team. I try to focus on CS, extend lane phase in easy bot lane matchups to further abuse them and gain gold, buy an extra ward in case my support has to go back and I know my team would benefit from vision somewhere, or any other number of things.   Games can be frustrating at times and you'll get mad, upset and/or discouraged but that is just the nature of the game. Just take the time and learn from your own mistakes. And if you become too frustrated, stop Q'ing. Take a break and recollect yourself. Going into games with a bad attitude and full of frustration can really impact your game. So pace yourself if you are having a bad day. We all have them.
0	Break up with you or lose weight is a pretty assholish way about doing it, no. Calling a spade a spade is all fine and dandy but calling an asshole an asshole is just as fine.
0	Correct, Heaven and earth haven't passed away. But The law and the prophets were fulfilled by Christ and his death. It is possible that Since Jesus was not Omnipotent on earth ( as shown by him telling the disciples he didn't know when he was coming back, only the Father did) He wasn't entirely sure at that moment when his fulfillment would come.   It's a lot like someone saying " I will not rest until I die, Or until I complete  __  task."   It was a conditional statement. If the heavens and earth pass away before the law is fulfilled, they will still be current and vital, unless They are fulfilled before that time.
1	It offers the chance for another solo lane. Let me put it this way. When you have a duo-lane (two people in the lane) the exp is raised to 110% meaning  each champ in the lane will get 55% of the exp. In your mid lane your ap carry will get 100%. This will obviously cause the mid lanner to level up faster then bottom lane. Now on to jungle, when you have a jungler, he doesn't take lane exp and gets 100% of the jungle creeps exp. This frees up top lane to get 100% of his lanes of exp. This is a great way to get a level advantage over a enemy team  without a jungler. This is the main reason. The other reasons is that the jungler can gank more offended because his location is not know by the enemy team at all times.
1	As a main adc (but i support sometimes) I would say that often I believe supports are the ones who get recognition and the least blame when the game is going bad.  I rarely get mad at my support and it is only when supports are playing really bad by not warding or just positioning really really bad.   Most of the time though when team fights go wrong ADCs and AP mids are blamed. supports often ask- why you focusing tanks?? or why were you farming and not in teamfights? ADCs rarely get the benefit of the doubt when it seems they were focusing the rong people. Whenever they lose out in the laning phase its, GG WP ADC sucks. Really rarely do i get a support who gives me the benefit of the doubt. What supports do things like criticise their adc it just makes them play worst.
0	To all Redditors who do not know who this guy is or what he has done, basically he is one of the most extreme fundamentalist Christian in the world.  He is super homophobic, against birth control, all types of contraception, and abortion because it "goes against God", he believes is religious law over secular law and believes that the U.S. is a christian nation and is favored by his god. He also thinks that Obama is not motivated by the Bible and he wants to control sex by forcing people to either be abstintent or have sex for only procreation because he believes sex should not be enjoyable.
0	Or you'll have an experience like mine... went in for an alignment, left with a car out of alignment. Went back in, got car back with damaged rim. I watched my dash cam, the 'tech' drove my car up to a curb, and turned the wheel into the curb 7x and said "I don't give a fuck." Then went back and told the guys that were going to do the alignment that it was dead-on. Contacted the dealer, sent them a link to the YouTube video. They agreed to have my rim repaired by a third party and returned to me, and pay for an alignment at another dealer not affiliated with theirs. Then their 'legal council' reported me for "eavesdropping." DA dropped it after I spoke with the detective 4x in a day. I'm forfeiting my last 2 free oil changes.
1	I had a similar experience with awesome Rioters. My friends and I met Ryze, Ashley, Bamdragon, Micevans and ombotcfg during a normals. After  totally destroying them  some in game chatter, micevans offered to meet me during PAX Prime! We talked about what he does, how it is to work at Riot and I got to meet a bunch of other cool Rioters! I really enjoyed talking to Ziegler; talking to him about some of the champion designs was pretty awesome. During the event, I eventually got to meet Ryze himself and Mrs. Ryze. He remembered my Corki and good times were had. Mrs. Ryze was really nice and even gave me a few Riot Graves and Full Metal Rammus skin codes to help convince my friend to help me with tickets for Worlds (sadly didn't work out). The experience itself really made PAX for me, I could talk about it for hours.
1	breaking the meta in solo queue comes in the form of champion choices.   You don't see Froggen going double mid in Solo Queue. You did see him playing Lee Sin and other bruisers mid after the end of Season 2.   The meta isn't broken in terms of lane mechanics, it's done in terms of team composition, in solo queue.   Simply having the choices "Top/Mid/Bottom/Jungle" fixes 99% of the issues.  Having a support and a jungle is the most efficient way to play the game and, likely, will always be that way.  You can even go double bruiser kill lane bot by just the "Bottom" designation.   Obviously the flaw with this is "but what if you put in bottom and want adc, but get paired with another adc?".  Well to be honest that's the risk you're going to have to take.  At absolute worst, you go with a kill lane.   Further, as the meta evolves Riot can change the role designations.  I find it highly unlikely though that support and something double lane will ever leave the game.  It's obviously the most efficient way to play the game against equally skilled opponents.  Same thing with the Jungle.
1	I agree that IE is superior than BT now, but rushing it usually means either grabbing double dorans or a vamp scepter beforehand. It is completely possible that IE rush will be the norm now due to the increased AD on it. Unfortunately, you have to look at the survivability of ADCs in the current meta. I say double lifesteal will be popular over building IE because of the strength of bruisers. Plus people have already been using double lifesteal, so if IE does become common, it may take a bit longer for it to set in. I think the itemization choices of ADC depends on the enemy composition now, because if you don't need the survivability, you can forgo getting double lifesteal and get IE instead.
0	GPS is still one-way communication.  There's no satellites or cell towers to record its location in the middle of the ocean.  Yes, GPS on mobile phones is accurate with just satellites.  It's more accurate with towers and wifi hotspots assisting it.
1	It's half and half, really.  Of course if you build armor it's going to take longer for her to kill you, but at the same time her W makes it so that there's a limit to how long you can survive against her.   Your argument is a bit flawed anyways since you're using tumble as the comparison.  Let's say you attack once per minute (which is true for an itemless lvl 18 vayne), then you would get a tumble every other auto.  Using your numbers on a 2000 hp squishy (220 damage per W proc, ~73 true damage per hit), you would need to be hitting for 243 (not 243 AD, you need to hit for 243 after armor reduction) in order for tumble to be a bigger DPS boost than silver bolts.
1	Couple of college friends wanted me to play. Tried it out decided I didn't like it. Then this girl I was dating at the time tried to get me to play with her. I said no for quite a while. Though I did try occasionally and still decided against it.   Over winter break she said she'd tech me the ins and outs of the game. I figured worst case it'd be a great way to bond. We played a lot together over that break.   Now, she rarely plays, and we rarely talk, but I've been hooked ever since then. Although now I play with my friends who originally asked me all the time!
0	Oh joy, someone actually said this!  CRT displays use a shadow mask, and have no official "native" resolution.  They can display any resolution to a certain degree of clarity.  LCD displays have a single native resolution.  Playing anything but 1920x1080 videos will look like garbage because the image is not mapped 1:1 to the pixels in the set.
0	240 18yo male here: I consider myself to be really fat, so while I'm pretty sure I'm just fueling fire in this flame war and your recent history suggests you're an anomaly to human kind, I have something to say:   Personally, I'm really ashamed of being fat. Back when I was younger(basically up until I was 13), I had never really considered my diet or my exercise habits: I'm pretty sure I would have at least two sodas a day and calories did not matter to me as much as they do now.   Why does this matter? It's because I am aware that I'm fat, and that I really do feel bad. But the thing is, I know I'm fat: I'm changing my ways just so I can feel better about myself. I personally work out about 3-4 days a week(not as satisfactory as I'd like, but I'm a college student so I'm somewhat busy and I'm pretty lazy as a person) and I watch my calorie intake to the best of my ability. I'm working at losing weight, and I'm so happy when someone says "man, you've been really working at this!" in the gym.   The thing is, with people like you around, we enter this vicious cycle of depression and angst, leading to (what we thought as normal) binge eating and bad habits yet again. As much as you'd like to think we're ignorant or oblivious to the fat jokes around us, we know what's going on. The only way I stopped my friends from making any more fat jokes was by making fun of myself so often they just didn't know what to say.   That said though, I'll keep working to the best of my ability and I'll do my very best to not be so "fat-induced" for people like you.
0	It's really not different than a bass guitar or a bass fish. It's not pretentious to mix up those pronunciations, it's just wrong.   The Greek food item is pronounced 'year-oh' everywhere I've been in America except certain little backwater towns like Philadelphia and New York.   A 'jy roe' is a rapidly spinning motor. I'm not necessarily going to argue with someone who calls the food a 'jy roe' but calling it the wrong thing doesn't make you correct, it makes you a meat head.
0	I've build loads for myself and my friends. I never charge my friends because I want to introduce them to custom PCs and PC gaming the best way, and I enjoy it anyway. Because I am a reviewer I am normally able to sell them something on the cheap, so they get a lower price and I earn some money.   Anyway, I was building one for my friend and he asked whether he could watch so he could try to understand how they worked. I was pretty experienced by this time so I wasn't bothered. But, the case I chose, a Zalman Z7 was a complete bastard! It was an excellent case for the price, but I had to wrestle with the thing to install anything. Eventually I got it together after receiving a massive gash to my finger and cleaning the blood off the motherboard.   It took about 4x longer than it should and made me look a complete moron. Finally I got the thing together, went to power it up. Nothing. No POST beeps, no fans, completely dead. He was looking at me like "WTF, why is my £700 PC not working." I played it off, started testing the PSU, checking for shorts on the back of the motherboard tray, checking to front panel connectors. Then my friend pulled off the front bezel. Turns out the power switch is on the bezel rather than the main body of the case, and you had to connect the button to the wire that goes to the motherboard header. I felt a complete idiot, I've never been in a situation where a PC hasn't worked first time, and with the guy watching me the pressure was on. So all that fault finding just to find that the switch wasn't connected!
0	Uhhh.. no it's not. By that logic all calories are created equal, which they are NOT. It's not as simple as calories in < calories out = weight loss. Any nutritionist will tell you that eating 300 calories worth of vegetables isn't the same as say, eating 300 calories of Doritos. In addition, weight loss is 90% diet, 10% exercise. Yes, exercising certainly helps, but if you're 50 pounds overweight, hitting the gym for 3 hours a day isn't going to make you lose weight as quickly as eating a high fat/high protein/high fiber diet. Numerous studies have proven this to be an effective way to lose weight. Smarter people than me (Such as Gary Taubes and Robert Lustig) have written books and have hard data to prove this.
0	AND you should look at [this article]( before we all start thinking false accusers should immediately be jailed:   The study found that a significant number of these cases involved "young, often vulnerable people, and sometimes even children".   Around half were brought forward by people aged 21 and under, with some involving people with mental health difficulties.   In 38% of those investigations, the initial complaint of rape or domestic violence was made by someone other than the suspect. When the alleged victim was under 18, that figure rose to 50% and often involved a parent.   "From the cases we have analysed, the indication is that it is therefore extremely rare that a suspect deliberately makes a false allegation of rape or domestic violence purely out of malice," Mr Starmer added.   "It is within this context that the issue should be viewed, so that myths and stereotypes around these cases are not able to take hold."   "There were 5,651 prosecutions for rape for the period between January 2011 and May 2012 the study looked at, but only 35 for making false allegations of rape. Likewise, there were 111,891 prosecutions for domestic violence, but only six for making false allegations of domestic violence."
1	I think it's pretty clear that it's a nerf, as you need more items to deal the same damage (even though those items are a natural part of a standard Ahri build). However, a nerf isn't always bad. Ahri is a very strong AP carry, and she brought a lot to the table as far as damage, CC, and mobility. A damage nerf was in order, and the one that they did was very measured and focused on exactly when her damage was a problem: early game.
0	You are sorely mistaken if you think all military members sign up to kill. Sure there are douchebags that the OP was talking about but that is by far the minority and those people are seen as immature idiots, at least in my circle. Most of us are here for sensible reasons like to pay for college or to provide for LOVED ones. Almost none of us want to kill and thankfully most of us won't be put in a position where we have to. There are normal jobs like air traffic controllers or legal assistants that never see combat. Your statement is based off ignorance and that's okay.
1	Following the same procedure, except that I ignore the boundary limits and follow the movements in the numerical champion order. Meaning when I hit the top of the champion pool, I move to the bottom of the list, and on the side, I move up or down a row. This results in from Aatrox start; 5 d reaches Anivia, 4 a returns to Ahri, 1 w then goes vertically to the bottom of the list to none other than Wukong the monkey man just like you've got. From there we maintain the similarity to Nasus and Olaf. Here is where it changes up, going 41 spaces back using the numerical champion order, we come to the mysterious Galio. 6 s from there brings us to the Plague rat Twitch. And end with 5 to the right ending on, who followed me? VEIGAR!!! Given the giant gauntlet for the final boss previewed today. I think my work here is done.
0	It really depends on how the teen parents became teen parents in the first place. If it was an accident (broken condom), I can understand. I still think it's a little stupid to be having sex if you're in no position to take care of a child if anything happens but no one is perfect.  If it's because she let a dude go balls deep raw then yes, I blame her. Even if she's on the pill it doesn't make sense to me to risk it.
1	Hey. Gold 5 Trash as well. I use both and change everything for every champ.   For example, on Leona, I smart cast everything, but not solar flare. On Morgana, I smart cast everything, but not Dark Binding. I smart cast everthing on Cait. (I have non smart cast set to shift+q, so I can time/aim more if necessary.   2 reasons why NOT to smart cast! (im sure there are more, but here it is)     Accuracy! you simply will miss more. no matter how much you practice, it really helps, and if you look at pro streams, you will see that most pros use "normal" casting for things like thresh hooks.      2.Timing. Yah you may be able tho throw stuff out like a madman, but if its at the wrong time, it doesnt matter. "normal" casting allows you to really throw stuff out there, but for moves like dark binding, it may be way more about timing than speed (and you can always keybind both options!)
0	I work in the online world, working remotely is pretty common in that industry.  Full disclosure I put in my dues before I got to this point.  Almost nobody is going to let a kid straight out of college work from home.  When I first moved to NYC and started my career there were years where I went to work and it was dark outside, took the subway underground to work, and when I went home it was dark outside.  In a way I used to do my budget in terms of how many $1 junior bacon cheeseburgers I had in my account.
0	The way you cower behind anyone throwing around the term 'racism' is fucking weak sauce.  If anyone is a disgrace to Tennessee--it's you.  You make us look bad by compromising our traditions for the sake of being a group thinking moron, so allow me to say--you're a shameful representation of what an American man is slowly being metamorphosized to be.  Pretty sad that you welcome it with open arms.
1	Above fakers lvl please. Im by no means a fanboy of korean league. But thats just beyond stupid. Incarnati0n hasent proved anything in a lan envoirement. And owning soloq is hardly a sign that you're gonna do well in  a proffesional setup, proven countless times now.   And sure he is truely a soloque monster. But a cliffhanger people seem to leave out is that most of his rank1 was archieved by duo-Q recently a good example would be his r1 at the moment (Apdo dog2) Duo-Q a shitton with Rekkles and WhiteKnight108 (Another pretty sick soloq guy)   Im not saying he wouldnt archieve rank1 without, but it certainly helped.
1	OK doing some quick math here.   Caster minions initially give 29.44 exp. according the lol wiki. Melee minions initially give 58.88. This gives a solo laner 264.96 exp. from the first wave of minions. However, you need 280 exp in order to reach level 2.   By using the equation 264.96(x)=280, you'll see that x=1.05676, which basically means that you need a nearly 5.7% exp. boost in order to reach level 2 on the first wave. This can be done using Zilean's passive (8%) or by using three exp. quints. (2% each for a total of 6%) You can also get up to 5% exp. boost from your masteries, but you'd only need 3 points in the mastery to get to 3.75% and then adding an exp. quint to exceed the required percentage.
1	Correct, top lane he has his counters, but I see him beating a lot more people there than in mid.  He's situational in both lanes but is more comfortable top but more potential in mid.   Yeah, CLG really gave the opportunity for IG to run Master Yi, it was unexpected too for them.   I would pick Master Yi over Akali or Katarina because he can win different lanes that Akali can't, he can also get the job done quicker and potentially cleaner while Akali or Katarina would be clearly better in more situations than Yi would be.  CLG left a door wide open, low CC count, they couldn't stop Yi, and with Jarvan just being such a great partner for Yi, closing people up and being able to burst primary targets quickly and leaving Yi to finish them off and get AoE damage and a refreshed Q, IG was able to abuse the opportunity that CLG gave them.
0	Each department has a secretary at my school. I had one professor who was horrible about cancelling class without notice. Not even a note on the door. One day, I decided to call the secretary to see if she could tell me if my professor would be in that day. She had no clue but asked me to hold. Next thing I know I am connected to the head of the department. He tells me no class today, apologizes for the time and money I had wasted in the past and assured me it would never happen again. It didn't! We always knew at least one class in advance of cancellation.
1	Someone did that math once, but I can't find it (might have been on a stream). With targets around 70-80 or more mr, purchasing void staff will do more damage than deathcap (all while being ~1000g cheaper). Having 70+ mr is nearly a certainty with the addition of bulwark. If you aren't fitting a void staff into your builds somewhere, you need to re-evaluate them.   EDIT FOR PROOF : I just did the math out for a level 11 Syndra (maxing R>Q>W>E), who has one of the highest burst ratios in the game. I even padded it in her favor by giving her 5 balls out for her ult (to give her higher ratios). Here are the calculations:   Full burst combo: 230(.6) + 160(.7) + 70(.4) + 675(1)   Simpler Form: 1135(2.7)   100AP from runes/masteries/dorans or whatever   Deathcap ((100 + 120) * 1.25 = 275 AP)   Voidstaff (170AP) + 35% pen   DC Pre Resistances : 1135 + (2.7 * 275) = 1887.5   VS Pre Resistances : 1135 + (2.7 * 170) = 1594   DC Damage With 80MR : 1887.5 * (100/(100 + 80)) = 1048.61   VS Reduction with 80MR: 80 * .65 = 52   VS Damage with 80MR: 1594 * (100/(100 + 52)) = 1048.68   Voidstaff wins by a fraction, while being 1000g cheaper. It also scales better per additional AP than deathcap (35% pen vs 25% addition ap), while also scaling against resistances (if the enemies buy more mr). I left out pen from runes and masteries, though if people want I can do it with those too.
1	Little personal story of mine.   I was Gold 1 in my promo for Plat 5. I lost, we got shut down hard. I took a few days break to cool down. Started playing again and dropped to Gold 3. Took a week break to cool down. Started again and dropped to Gold 5 with low Silver maybe even Bronze MMR where I was lucky to gain 4LP for a win and lost 20 - 30 for a lose.   Took a month but I am finally at a point where I am gaining 12 - 20 LP per win again. I started watching a lot of Trick2g's jungle videos and saw where my issues were with not just my jungling but all roles. I was playing for kills and not for the win.   There is no "ELO Hell" there is a thing called "Personal ELO Hell" however. This is where you think you are in an ELO where you are better then every other player on your team and the enemy team.   If this is the case PROVE it. Now I am jungling a lot and I am starting to notice more openings that Trick2g has pointed out in multiple videos. I see a weaker jungler, I punish the shit out of them. Past 3 games I had their jungler only got their first blue buff, rest of the game their team did not see a single buff.   I had countless games on my climb from my "Personal ELO Hell" where the support trolled and did not want to ward. What did I do? As the jungler I bought a Sight Stone and made sure bot lane was warded for the ADC.

1	In order to even get to promotionals, you need to have an mmr higher than your current division. So if you're a silver looking to get to gold, your mmr must be at the minimum gold (I heard somewhere it was equal to the third division of the tier so Gold 3?) before you can even qualify for promotions. In this sense, if you even got into promotionals in the first place, you had to have defeated increasingly higher leveled players, otherwise you wouldn't have made it to promotionals.   The system is fine because the important matchmaking variable IS your mmr. The mmr is the more accurate measurement of where you should be or are at the moment. The division/tier system is nothing but visual fluff to give you an easier to interpret figure. It's supposed to make it easier for you to compare your position with your friends as well as make objectives clearer (i.e. I want to get into the next division/tier, to do so I just have to go through x divisions).   -- Take the case where your mmr is much higher than your current division. In your case, you would get matched up with those in the same division and, because your skill level is much greater, you are more likely to win and, depending on how much higher your mmr is, you may completely dominate the other team. You would constantly do this until you begin to struggle more to win and then you'd settle around where you should be. In the process, however, you would have probably stepped on a lot of people trying to move up (hence why Riot doesn't endorse smurfing).   In current case, you are constantly matched against people of your presumed skill level. Riot compensates for the fact that because you're matched against people around your mmr, the chances of victory shouldn't be so lopsided, and adjusts the actual visual gain of ranking (LP) as such. So since you have a higher mmr than your division, if you lose, your LP loss isn't that much, and if you win, you gain a large amount of LP. If you're playing people of your skill level, you should win about as often as you lose in which case you would actually make gradual progress up. On top of that, since you're playing people around your presumed skill level, it gives you more opportunity to improve your play while you're working up.   --
0	Not really sure why you are being downvoted. Kinda think you nailed it. My only edit would be to the "prettier than me" thought pattern. I would say "desirable", as some of these girls aren't pretty (in the conventional sense of the word) but somewhat attractive and willing to do what it takes to "please the man" (read: make a few bucks) no matter how many inches they have to take in the bunger. My ex got mad at me, not that I watched porn, but that I watched it without her. Then, relinquishing my privacy, she became displeased in my CHOICE of pornography. She was appalled that I got off on big bootied women getting plunged in the b-hole. Even more so, I hypothesize that she was afraid that I wasn't really satisfied by her, even though she had/has a more than sufficiently round rump, and loved doggie with an occasional thumb slip. Long story long, ex was into the same shit as me, but got mad when she wasn't able to decide what I was into. Guess that should have been a
1	Okay, i just finished reading half the comments and i think that he should get a little more Q or W range, and his 5% of his max hp as dmg on his E, imo that would make him a little harder to harass while also giving him more dmg on engage and imho, this won't make him SUPER overpowered just at least a higher tier. The W range would make it a bit harder to harass him if he becomes a toplaner while the slingshot percent max hp dmg will give him a reason to stack HP like people have been complaining about, the % dmg could also go up as you charge and might even give reason to charge past just the max range, make for some better engage but also more counterplay because he would be sitting there longer. And i saw a post about  > slamming them with your weight(hp)   and i thought that it was a cool idea :3 Just my opinions but what do i know im bronze 1 (silver last season)
1	depends on how much damage the ult does.  usually against high damage ults players would prefer to b rather than risk it, so basically using the ult won't do anything.
1	I wouldn't want them to be a permanent edition cause gambling is what literally kills MMOs. Look at Maplestory, Potentials & Cubes are just so irresistible and people spend thousands because they have 'bad luck' (Nexon rigged random generator) and they want the perfect stats. The rune combiner proves to just be an IP dump since it's highly unlikely you'll get the standard runes that most people use.
1	LOL...Fair enough.  I was concerned it was a big post, but I wanted to make sure it was clear enough so that people could get the info we needed.
1	If you hit a Q, you apply a stack of Ekko's passive, but not Diana's.   This is because Ekko's passive applies on spell or auto attack whereas Diana's only applies on auto attacks. That is how it is designed.   Also, diana's doesn't have to be on the same target, but ekko's does.
0	Drinking isn't illegal.  Getting drunk isn't illegal.  Further, getting drunk and being in public isn't illegal either.  It's a common misconception reinforced by asshole cops or perhaps equally misinformed cops.  Being drunk in public only contributes to a criminal act when coupled with some activity which either disturbs or blocks the public use of the public area or shows that you are incapable of caring for yourself.  Note: slight stumbling, slurring of calm words, or smelling like a tub of booze do not demonstrate such incapacity.  Conversely, yelling, throwing up, falling down, running into people or things, or walking into the street will give the cops legitimate justification for citing/arresting you.   Basically, you should take your citation (or arrest) as calmly as possible.  And then when sober, don't just rollover and pay the fine or plead guilty without at least first checking the cop's written incident report to see if what he alleges even supports the charge.  If he doesn't specifically state something you did that could be seen as a disturbance (i.e. yelling, throwing up, etc.) or that shows incapacity (ie. falling down, walking into the street, etc.) then you have an extremely high chance of winning a challenge.
1	What a lot of people forget is that this is the largest online game ever.  to play this game Riot needs to be able to connect 10 people to each other millions of times over every second of every day.  The fact is that Riot is uncharted waters here with just how big this ONLINE ONLY game is.  Only WOW and Cod ever have come close to how big LOL is and even then LOL is an order of magnitude bigger then either of them.   EUW unfortunately is just to big for Riot's infrastructure to handle so whats their solution?  Build a new server center and they are doing that but buildings take time to build.  Servers take time to produce.  Server centers take time to set up.   Then you say replays are missing thats ridiculous.  From my understanding the current replay system that was on PBE for about a year now fuctions like a spectator mode and is saved server side.  I don't know if there is another solution that manages to save replays client side, but from my understanding the SC2 replay system wouldn't work in league due to how the game processes commands.  So now to add to the PBE replay system  Riot needs to run a new game everytime one person watches a replay then they need to save a however large replay file server side also.  So to do this you are requiring the severs that are already buckling under the amount of people playing to do more.
1	That actually doesn't really make sense, every time someone wins a lane someone else loses it. If everyone has won their lane the game was pretty unbalanced and a stomp. Normally someone will lose their lane, and if it's not you, it's your job to carry them. If it's you, it's your job to help your team carring you as good as possible.   Or to say it different: If you assume that you're the best on your team, that means there will be someone equal good on the enemy team (Matchmaking), and if he isn't laning against you, he will probably win his lane. Which means that one role should be undecided, which means that you can influence it (depending on you and his role) to make him win the lane. With two won lanes, teamfighting gets much easier.
0	I went to a high-volume strip club that had about 2,000 people inside, $20 cover. I have high levels of social anxiety, and so I chilled at the bar until a stripper came by and said hello, and I introduced myself. She asked why I was there, and I told her I just got out of a bad breakup. She pretended to care, which sadly, was good enough for me.   She told me it was $40 for a dance, touching allowed. fuckyes.jpg. We go upstairs, and for about 3 minutes, she gives me a lapdance, and I feel her ass and tits. After the song ends, she tells me she has it in her to give me a couple more dances, and completely hypnotized by the touch of a woman, I'm all like, "FUCK YES". As soon as she realizes all the ATMs are out of order, she says I can wait a bit longer, to which I say, "Nah, I gotta go. Thanks though!"
1	I don't know if I agree with this. I am between 800-900 ELO and people in ranked just berate me for being unranked when I duo queue with a ranked friend. Even taking duo queue out of the equation, since pick order is based on ELO, I am assaulted for being last pick as well: it tells people up front, whether they can see my number or not, that they're "better" than I am. People can also see my W/L ratio (I currently lose two for every one I win) and match history, which give them  way  more ammunition at my level of play than just a number.   If your primary reasoning for making sub 1200 ELO "unranked" is to protect people from ragers, then you're doing it wrong in addition to making us feel like shit about ourselves. It would be much better to show ELO and hide information like W/L and match history. Everyone already knows ELO is a number that doesn't necessarily reflect your skill level, but if they can see you went negative in your last three games, or lost your last five games, they're going to tear you a new one.
1	EVEN without that, ijji is a shit company   Do you have any idea how badly Special Force is doing right now? There are a few other special force players lurking around here, and it's so impossibly hard to find a scrim because the game is just completely dead. New hacks come out every day, which don't get fixed until a month, it's ridiculous. Special Force is an absolutely huge game in Korea (not as big as SC2 ofc) and it's sad to see such a small, poor company deal with it in US.   And then ESL picked up SF, which was its last hope to be revived, but ESL for some reason picked the absolutely 3 worst people to be the admins. You know the guy who got kicked from ESL for calling chauster an ignorant fuck? That guy isn't even one tenth as bad as the people who run it in SF. They don't know how to run a tournament, period. One guy was literally hacking (aim-keying) but the admin was AFK and didn't see it. The clan was still DQ'ed, but that's just silly.   And then there are so many other external flaws... the admins would DQ one team for an offense while not DQ'ing another team for the same, if not worse offense. It was especially prevalent in the fact that one admin was actually in a clan that was competing in ESL.   Well, done venting.
0	Actually, the main reason that gifs take longer to load is that they are transported through the internet using a different protocol.  Youtube videos are sent using User Datagram Protocol (UDP), whereas a gif or any other image is sent using Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).  Without getting too technical, the basic difference is that TCP packets are designed to avoid network congestion, and all TCP packets must be received for the image to load properly.  UDP packets, on the other hand, completely ignore congestion issues and are sent one time only.  This results in a lot of packets being lost, but most of the time enough packets are received that your computer automatically fills in the gaps and creates an overall acceptable image.

0	This enrages me to the point of nearly getting me killed. I was driving in Los Angeles, down the 5, close to the 134 merge. I needed to get on the 134, and started a merge, but an Astrovan driven by an Armenian guy accelerated into me to close the gap. I had already made it about halfway into the lane, so I had to swerve out. This totally enraged me, so (being from New Jersey), I did what had to be done. I flipped the guy off and waited for him to pass me so I could merge behind him. Thankfully, I was so angry that I decided to go for the second flip off as he was passing, because right when he entered my blind spot, he swerved his car into me. I had to make the snap decision to swerve into the lane to the left of me, without looking, to avoid collision. Thankfully, nobody was there. The guy then pulled ahead of me, and I could see him cursing and screaming at me, and tried to merge into me again. This time, I broke, and let him get in front of me. He then slowed to 25 mph on the fucking 5 freeway, and was swerving all over the road to block me from passing him. For those of you not from LA, the average speed on the 5 is about 85 mph, and he was going 25. Finally, we got to the 134 merge, and I managed to get onto the other freeway without him. I wrote the guy's plates down, and called CHP, but they basically laughed it off. The weirdest part of the whole thing was the guy had like a family of six in the car with him. I could see his wife screaming at him to stop, as he tried to kill me.
1	No time to read.
0	I love when anything even hinting of mentioning race happens in the sports world all the sudden every single black reporter on ESPN becomes a racism expert and then try to make it seem like they are the ones who get to deem where the racism line is drawn.   Ex: Mike Wilbon on Cuban - "I could have done without the mentioning of the hoodie and tattoo"   Well Wilbon I don't give a fuck what you could have done without. People blowing these comments out of proportion is becoming dangerous. Soon anyone with any sort of power or money to lose will not be allowed to express/have any sort of opinion in fear of getting ruined by the media.
0	We got to the storage unit at 5:05, and the front office closed at 5:00. They were in no mood to help. My local friend showed up with bolt cutters and a grinder after a call of desperation. The bolt cutters didn't work because the lock was too heavy duty, and we didn't have a long enough extension cord to plug the goddamn grinder in. I ended up paying $75 for a late night visit from a sketchy locksmith that didn't give two shits about whether or not the front office gave their approval. He had a 100 ft extension cord... my friend had a 75 ft. All in all, just a shit day.
0	Yeah...20 years isn't exactly an interlude.  Its a termination.   I'm not saying friendships and relationships can't restart after that time, but after 20 years, HOPEFULLY, people have entirely changed and moved in different directions.   Still, having said that, these are people who, at their core, are willing to turn on someone in mob fashion and beat a 'friend' into the hospital over petty items lost due to 'thievery' absent any evidence or rule of law.   Ergo, forgive, don't forget.  And if you want to befriend someone after 20 years, approach it as a new relationship with someone who has a known history for turning on 'friends' violently.   Although I haven't that experience, my initial response--not knowing the full story--would be that these people don't deserve that type of access to the OP, and perhaps he should value himself in such a fashion.   Its a big wide world out there, and there are many good people to befriend that won't turn on you in such a fashion.  Why waste time on people who have demonstrated their lack of worth?   OP needs to sort out his esteem issues and all the issues surrounding that day.  Having the truth come out is important, but there's other issues that have grown from that day that are unresolved and, I would suspect, still impact him.   &nbsp;
1	And urgot? How do you justify him? He can lock on and do as much damage, not to mention he's just as mana thirsty as Yi. Yi's also the equivalent of mid soraka, infinite harass with good range and forever sustainable.   How much does yi bring to a teamfight? He has a minimum 4-6 sec cd nuke. 1, not 2, not 3, just 1. It has a decent scaling, but that's just 1 nuke. At the most he will get 3 off in a teamfight, maybe 4 if he gets last hit on some champs. That's almost nothing to what a REAL AP caster brings. An AP caster brings just as much as damage as Yi, and sometimes a type of CC as well which yi lacks.   You can even beat Yi with a good harass champions like Cass, Karthus or Ziggs. His Q has a very long cool down (over 10 seconds) during the early levels, take advantage of this and push him out of lane. Even if he gets his Q back and attacks you, you should have won the damage trade with like the 5 seconds of free attacks you had on him.
1	So here's the thing: Dade is more of a specialist. What makes Faker disgustingly good is that he's good on almost every champion he plays. In champions, there was a point where in three consecutive games he debuted an entirely new midlaner for his professional career in each game. He's great, and that greatness doesn't dip for alternative champions, albeit he is definitely strongER on assassins.   Dade is an assassin and melee/non-skill shot specialist. I consider Dade's Zed better than Faker's (le what?! but faker with the outplay in season 3?! Dade's Zed is still better, watch the vods from last spring.) and a few other champions as well, but Dade is much more easy to expose on other champions. I'm guessing half the reason Samsung figured out Yasuo was a counter to the old Nidalee is because Dade didn't want to play her.
1	I am saying that Riot said Manasteal would be unbalanced in an old meta where every champion relied on mana to use their abilities and it costed a LOT.  But all of a sudden we have a new meta where soft CC is useless because every popular champion has some sort of gap opener / closer and can build tenacity to never have to stop.
1	I never really played singed, but cho is my main and i love him. He is so versatile. I usually build tanky and go solo top, but he can do almost everything. I have gone an ap carry build with him mid and dominated some of the most OP mids. Late game his feast is just so amazing. If I land rupture on anyone with half health or less I can combo with my w and ultimate for an easy kill. The best is when people don't expect the ultimate. They will have around a third health and sit on a turret. I can either flash in, eat them, then run out, or just land a rupture and do the same. He is a really fun champ to play and in my opinion is underplayed. He may not be a conventional tank but he fits the role very well. I will have to try singed soon though.
1	It seems for you that you are doing bad, because subconsciously you have a high standard for yourself. So even if you are doing good, you can still think you are doing bad. It's like people who think that everyone hates them, even though no one even cares.
1	Normal draft is really not an answer to learning how to play new roles or champions for a player in a high division.   Normal games have their own hidden MMR, making them just as difficult as ranked games for a player who has played an equal number of both.   There WILL be a plat player against me on the other team who will very likely play to that level.   I will not be playing like a plat player at all because that isn't where my skill level is with what I'm playing even though that's what the system THINKS I will be.   I'm a player learning how to top lane, having been an adc/support/jungle main since season 1.   Where am I expected to learn how to play top, assuming that I will be stomped without mercy by any gold or plat top main?   A smurf account seems the perfect way to learn and I see it as a nicer thing to do than to intentionally throw games by trying to play something I know I will lose with on my main account.   Trying to learn a new role and new champions on my main account isn't fair to anyone on my team.   To players in silver 4 I'm just an average top laner.   To players in plat I'm the troll who went 0/8 and needs to be reported for intentional feed and ruining the game.
0	You can get up at 8am and make it to your 8am class? That's impressive. Even living on campus it took me a minimum of 10 minutes to get to any building. And if I didn't want to look like a bum, I needed to at least put on clothes but preferably take a shower. If I really wanted to look good during my next 4 hours of classes I had to put on some make up and dry my hair.
1	To start with I would like to state that The Void is probably loosely based on the works of H.P. Lovecraft. For evidence of this we can see a few points, Cho'gath sounds a bit like shoggoth, the fact Malzahar has an obvious Arabic design to his outfit combine that with him being the profit of the void and we get the Mad Arab (the profit from Lovecraft’s works)as well as a few other things, but I digress.   Looking at these facts we can probably assume that the beings in there are meant to be twisted versions of stuff we see in Valoran it just so happens that the ones that make it through to us so far are insectoid there could be a whole load of creatures we haven’t seen yet lurking in there for example the cancelled/suspended void champ that made way for Riven’s release was more like a big dog or cat.   Also taking the idea that the void is a Lovecraftian world the beings there are based off human fears and things that creep us out and most of us find bugs creepy.
0	Honestly, their complaints stem from poor customer service.   When they came and installed our 50Mb line, they gave us the wrong router.  My buddy who owns the place was like "nah it's cool" since he got a good connection being a millimeter away from the fucking thing and since it was in his name he didn't do anything about it, at first.  Since I got shit internet upstairs and he didn't.   I was, at the time, thinking this can't be the correct router, this is a dinky little Belkin that I had when I could get HBO on my TV just by hooking the internet line up to the TV.   Well, I called them and told them and sure enough not only did he install the wrong router but he put on a bunch of in-line resistors improperly that were supposed to balance the signal, but really were just insane interference.   The problem was that it was some sub-contractor for TWC that did the initial install and argued with me about Belkin modem being better than my Linksys WRT54G going through a Surfboard modem and that I was wrong and that's all the Internets we were going to be getting or deserved, then he wouldn't pick up his phone when we called to get it fixed because, I assume, he was a dumb ass.   So Time Warner sends out one of their actual tech guys, who looked like a Navy Seal of internet installation.  I still don't know why you would have that many computers hanging off of your gear vest.   Anyway, he was extremely gentlemanly and quite polite and knowledgeable, pretty much the anti-thesis of most of the installers I've had.  Fortunately, I've had some interesting philosopher-esque installers in the past.  He was too attractive for that gig, you know he didn't have a problem getting laid.  I think I even told him, haha.   I usually never do that, mostly because I'm straight and I have enough problems getting girls to like me without sounding gay, when I'm just being nice.   My friends say I say the gayest shit like Tobias Fünke, sometimes I do it intentionally, but I think it's really funny with my truly accidental phrasing too.  Like when I described to someone how to hit this certain type of pipe, and my best friend was there to turn it around and make it super gay.  To be fair, put your lips around it and suck really slowly doesn't sound straight at all.
0	I'm going to counter this using an immediate family member as an example.   He has had undiagnosed hypothyroidism for many years, probably between 5-7. Before that, he was a star athlete (he could run a sub 5-minute mile by the time he was 13) and an honor roll student, however things started changing at the end of high school/beginning of college. During those years I watched him balloon in weight, have uncontrollable (seriously... uncontrollable) cravings for horrible food, lose his hair, have awful skin rashes, depression, and so little energy that he found it difficult to be awake for more than 12 hours on any given day, let alone work out.  I too blamed his appearance and depression on personal failings that he had the capacity to control.   However, a few months ago he was diagnosed with hypothyroidism. After trying a few medications that had little effect he found a medication that worked for him-- Amour Thyroid. He started taking this ONLY 10 days ago, and he has already lost 7 pounds (after struggling unsuccessfully to lose weight for upwards of 5 years), is waking up at 7am every day to go running, is the most positive he's been in years and (which is most relevant to your topic) has no more cravings for those awful foods that you associate with hopelessness and lack of self respect.
1	The Problem is not his damage in the firstplace alone, this is counterable. Everybody who complain about Zed in trashtalk manner are mostlikly not aware why he is what he is. To know why Zed is so strong you need to compare his strength against his weakness. If you have a high skilled Zed Player, he knows about those and use them to his own advantage.   weakness:     easy to itemize against him   only fokused to kill one champ     strength     clearspeed in cs'ing   strong reengaging ability after getting out of a teamfight   free repositioning in teamfights.   great map pressure as splitpusher and high duelling potenetial   allmost free escap in outnumbered ganks.     So what is the real deal with Zed?     He is conterable with the right itemization, but this itemization with qss/houglass is at the same time the thing that makes Zed so strong. To explain it:     Building against him needs X itmes in the enemy team on high valuable damagedealers who can't invest in more damage heavy items. This force the enemyteam built against Zed on a high priority and therefore the Zed team have an advantage. Zed is free to chose his targets so everybody beside the tank is the weakpoint. And in the End the Zed team have the damage advantage over the other team. This if played correctly give the Zed team a slight advantage over the enemy team what is expandable.   This means, even if you don't be threatned directly with Zed, Zed can show up and blow you off. Normaly the defensiv Items will be built at the end of a full itembuilt, but with a Zed on the enemy team he turns the end of a building chain into the front.     Teamfight  Zed is one of the champs you can't kill after he dive you and have done his job. To be fair, yes with much waste of cc you controll him maybe, but the rest of the Zed team will abuse this to kill you, while you are busy to only kill Zed. And Zed if he isn't killed just disengage after he pops a enemy and stay back and w8 to rengage until another enemy is low. The most chars who dive to kill one champ of the enemy asap are stuck in the middle of the enemyteam with no chance to get out. But Zed doesn't have this problem. Zed just dive pop the enemy he wan'ts to kill and disengage. This is why he is such a difficult enemy to handle with.     Gank him for punishing his split push attempts is by far a thing you can't accomplish even if you outnumber him. One vs one, he is very strong and only some champs could sustain vs him but can't kill him and those who actually can force him out of lane or kill him only can do this at a stage of the game, they never will reach in a fast pasted game. So to speak. If you wanna controll Zeds splitpush you need more than one player who handle him, what by hisself makes other lanes vulnurable to the zed team. And even if you wanna gank him as seen in the Pro events LCS he easy run away wasting the time of the gankers and escaping.
1	Oh I had few of those. One is the most intense game ending I ever had > They took 3x inhib in our base but I've managed to 1vs5 penta them as Morde at our nexus and it let my team stall long enough for our inhibs to respawn. Few minutes later we got 1 inhib and 2 nexus towers but they backdoored and took our inhibs again. Shortly after that everyone but me died at giant 5v4 baron throw. I was in their base mashing nexus when their inhib respawned so I couldn't finish, meanwhile enemy supers were approaching our nexus from all sides, all my teammates dead with 30+ death timers. Enemy adc Sivir respawned and tried to stop me from backing, but I ended up killing her with good ol' dfg-flash-mace-to-the-face-e-ignite combo and got her ghost. As there was no point to back anyway I've used Sivir to take inhib and started attacking their nexus again while our 20%nexus was swarmed by at least 100 enemy minions and no one to defend. As it was described to me, we won thanks to winions that spawned among enemy supers and drew tiny bit of aggro that stopped them from attacking our  16 HP  nexus for final second in which me and Sivir did the 50g last hit, all in front of enemy team flashing and throwing everything at me. I never had this big adrenaline rush while playing League.
1	This occurs everytime there's a queue and every single time someone gets in queue they feel the need to submit it to reddit. You are not a unique snowflake, it's Riot's lame joke and we don't need 5 submissions every time there's a server issue.

0	His title is actually properly capitalized. Note how he didn't capitalize the  infinitive "to" as is the general rule. To used as a preposition is also not capilalized. Unfortunately Reddit DGAF about proper capitalization in titles, so there are people like you who think it's incorrect to do it that way. Your own comment, if it were a title, would not capitalize at or the which are a preposition and article respectively.
1	Id like an explanation of what happened, didnt see the stream. Is HBO sponsoring/does that mean we'll start to see LCS on HBO/ does that mean we're going to see à rise in content quality.
1	You should research how the DC system in dota 2 functions. You just argued moot points because you have no idea how it works. It eliminates the problems you speak about because it has set requirements in order for the game to be "leaveable". No deaths before 5 minutes or something like that, among a few other stipulations. BTW your "opinions" on dota are fucking pointless, please take a rest on bashing the game.   Please alteast  try  to have some valid points when you argue next time.
1	Well firstly would like to point out that before EG it was known as CLG.EU, which means they would be acquainted with their sister team CLG NA. Secondly, both CLG teams used to operate similarly which was to farm farm farm, give up on dragon and objectives if its risky, go for lategame. Both Froggen and Doublelift were the major "Carries" and their team played a more supportive role that revolved around the "Carries". I'm not discrediting Bigfaltlp in the mid, and Wickd Top+Yellowpete carrying potential, but Froggen and Doublelift were the HARD carries for both teams
1	imo riot doesn't want to alienate the asian (korea/china) players. as much as we're raising pitchforks here some WE/AF fanatics in their home country just might kick up a fuss as well if they are DQed especially if WE/AF steadfastly maintain their innocence to their fans.   also i think crs/dig collusion was them agreeing to split the #1 and #2 place prize money regardless of who won and were overheard by someone when they were discussing it in some cafe.
0	Ex-Toys R Us employee here. I once had a customer try and start a fist fight with me because we where understaffed and I was the only one running big carry out items from our warehouse to the customer. He had to wait a whole extra 3 minutes till I could get him his product. Once I brought him his product he proceeded to yell at me for a couple minutes till his wife pushed him out the door swearing. I just smiled waved and said, " Thank for shopping at Toys R Us. Have a great day sir!" The entire store was watching him make a scene. I got a couple high fives from some customers when he left.
1	You are 5 mid because that's what your captain, Kog, decided he wanted to do. Captains have 4 empty slots for each other player and they choose which lanes/roles they want in those slots. When they get filled from the queue the captain can choose to approve or deny whatever champion is in that spot. If you end up with double ADC bot lane it's your captains fault because he hit the check mark on both Vayne and Sivir instead of clicking "X" for one of them and waiting for a support.
1	I agree. What I do not understand is why CS is that much more visible. CS is quite a flawed number due to many reasons:   1) Different gold value for different creeps. Toplaner getting small wolves when duojungling, botlane ADC killing enemy Zyra plants or anyone farming pretty well but missing all Cannon minions can mean a lot of gold difference that does not show in CS number.   2) Gold bounty for CS scales with time. Minion gold at around 50 minutes into the game has almost 50% more value than what it has at the beginning of the game.   These differences are only pronounced by global gold. In one of the LCS  games played this week  even casters realized this. One laner was 55 CS behind his counterpart (55:110) however global gold and all those little things mentioned earlier meant that the actual difference was just 400 gold. Which under "normal" circumstances is something like 15-20 CS difference.   Somebody may say that CS may mean level difference. But even this does not apply. Especially toplaners can get levels without CSing by soaking experience in 2v1 situations and then there is dragon experience, large jungle  monsters, exp from kills/assists and exp catchup mechanics. If you want to point to exp difference just compare levles and say this or that guy is this many levels behind.   The only thing CS is good for is when we have straight up lane duels and we are in early to mid game. This is the only time when CS difference show difference in laning skills or general playstyle (e.g. CS heavy farm jungler vs low CS ganking jungler). But we don't have much of those right now.
0	Topical story, literally happened an hour ago.   I bought a dell monitor in Dec. It had audio jack out that had issues, but I could kinda put up with it for a bit. I finally decide to try and get an RMA/return or whatever. Call their support number and over the course of 1 hr and 30 mins, I was transferred between departments 6 times 3 to the same one; put on hold for 30+ min at one point (there were other holds of lengths 2-15 min) in what I believe was an attempt to wait me out so they could hang up on me as it was only 10 min before their official hours was over when I decide to hang up; ten minutes before they're lines are suppose to close I hang up and redial them and ask to speak to a supervisor, they seem to do it, but I get immediately disconnected on the transfer attempt so I finally gave up and tweeted them about the shitty phone support.   They are actually helpful. What is ridiculous was that I told them what the exact problem was and needed an rma attempt every time they tried to transfer me. Fucking idiots. Also, who doesn't have an online rma form?
0	Well, sadly, he's one of the  many  guys who took all the steroids.  But, yes, and he now has the most home runs in baseball history, which in many people's opinion (mine included) is an enormous black eye for the sport I love so dearly.
0	This idea of a job singlehandedly paying for "the American Dream" is kinda warped   The consumer price index- CPI (basic bundle of consumer consumption goods on a yearly basis) has hardly changed in relationship to the real price of the dollar.   The reason why people were able to afford that kind of stuff was because banks were more willing to give out larger loans, on top have having lower real interest rates on the loans.   Since then, most of those banks have lost there asses (I dont really care, rich people losing money) with the liability of people who wouldn't pay them back. Though this is true, the general spending culture is very different today as well. The investment rate per dollar is much much lower today than it used to be (aka, people spend their money more than they save it, especially compared to back in the day).   A major reason for this is because people have trended towards spending more money on the entertainment, amusement, accomodation and recreation activities market. Though I'm not an expert on why that is, I can tell you that average american employment in this industry has actually increased substantially in the last 50 years, however this employment increase is dwarfed by the exponentially larger increase in spending in this industry.   There are other industries (ie electronics) like this that american consumers have trended towards, though these services and products are not included in the CPI. This is what creates the whole "I dont have enough money issue"   So basically, according to the government's consumer price index, the reason why we can't afford the basic  "american dream" is because we spend too much money on things that we don't need.
0	Because books have gone through an editing process and at least SOME publisher thinks the ideas contained within deserve to be published. Not necessarily true with an article, especially on the internet. Books are subject to a lengthier approval process, held to a higher standard and receive far more peer, publisher and reader scrutiny.   The reason? Money. It's expensive to publish, print and distribute books, so the publisher wants to make sure they have a high quality product before they ship it. Mistakes, subpar content and poor sales can result in recalls, reflect badly on the publisher and cost millions. Not so with an article, which anybody with a keyboard can write in less than a day and publish on their blog, or a website they own. Some of the larger web publications have professional standards, but these are also magazines and reputable news sources whose articles appear both online and in print.
0	As a 5'1" girl dating a 6'2" guy, I can say there does seem to be some sort of attraction between tall guys and short girls. With the exception of one guy, (who was 5'5") all the guys I've dated have been at least a foot taller than me. It's not on purpose from my end, but the guys have told me they have a thing for short women.
0	It's a photo of a dress taken with a shitty cell phone camera with the wrong white balance. The entire photo is immensely shifted towards yellow. This is what happens when I white balance / auto level the photo:   You can take the black and white dress in the background on the left as a reference for the black point and white point. It doesn't help that the photo is overexposed.
1	The point isnt that its against the law.... the point is that the law should not even excist in a capitalists world and instead of giving in just like that twitch could have gone to court. If they lost they could have said fine we go DCMA and problem solved. Just giving in without a fight is just sad.   Here is why i think its not theft. In the past (and for some products it still is) price was based on scarsity of a product. The less there is the more a price would be. Music these days is bits & bytes which can be copied endlessly so in a capitalist world it would and should be worthless.   Now thanks to governments (recorccompanies lobbying) all over the world they introduced copyrightlaws to protect this product from being copied. Well i should say protect the moneyvalue of this product and not protecting the artist as they usually get peanuts from recordlabels who control whats happening in the mainstream market but thats another point.   The copyright lenght. A copyright is valid till 70 years after the original artist died. I wish all workers would get paid till after 70 years of death. I bet someone who made a toilet and got it installed in a busy place would make quite a buck if they would get 5 pennies after every use for the rest of their life plus 70 years. but no they have to work on minimumwage and guess what no work no pay. No sitting around on your butt all day. I know that doesnt apply to alll artists but its still a valid point.   Some more reasons why copyright is wrong ... google is your friend or   Anywho
1	Well yeah, there were obvious problems, but.... this? This is what they came up with? This is the best they could do? Ryze is supposed to be a noob's introduction to the game. He's in the tutorial ffs, along with garen and ashe. Why would they turn him into literally the least intuitive champion in the game?   The Ashe rework was  amazing  because it made everything much more interesting, but more importantly because it made her perfect for new players.     The DPS-crit mechanic makes your overall damage increase really really clear and noticeable. The initial basic attack shows your dps without crit, and all the subsequent shots while they are slowed show how much more powerful you are becoming as you buy more crit items. It's so much clearer than "sometimes I do no damage and then I randomly do a million. I have no idea how much damage I can actually do."     New players will probably ignore "focus stacks" but that doesn't really matter too much. What they  will  notice is that using her q looks  fucking badass .     Her other skills are immediately self explanatory and they feel really significant.       The player understands that they are an archer chick,  they know what their abilities do, they feel powerful, and they look really cool. It actually makes you want to play the game.   Ryze, on the other hand....     "Sometimes my healthbar changes a little and my abilities do weird stuff really quickly. I have no idea what is happening or how to activate it. My W is cool because it makes them stop moving. My other abilities just throw a little ball but I can't hit anyone because minions are in the way all the time. Wtf am I supposed to buy, these items are all weird. Why does my mana do damage? What is cooldown reduction? I'm just a blue guy, what kind of character am I? Why do people like this game"     It feels like you have no idea what you're doing and you just throw these little things that do no damage because you have no cs. It's frustrating, it makes no sense, and it's just totally useless. They should put Annie in his place. Annie is so easy. You just fireball people and hit them with a huge teddy bear, killing them instantly.
1	How exactly has Froggen learned his lesson given that his response was basically a statement that he thought what he did was fine?   People can bring whatever dumb reasons they want into this when it comes to denouncing Froggen.  I don't really like entitled assholes, so that's my beef.  Some people seem to think pro-players should be role models or idols, not really my business how they think.   At the end of the day though, this is important and acceptable because Froggen is a public figure or, essentially, a brand.  If someone calls attention to a player acting like a jag-off and it generates a massive thread against that player, it's really no different than calling out bad customer service or company ethics.  Froggen can decide if people thinking he is an asshole impacts his bottom line and either adjust his actions or take the impact in stride.   The reason why 'HelloQuain flamed me!' type threads are generally met with apathy is because who the hell cares?  Report me and move on, my reddit/player-base popularity is completely unimportant.  The Froggen thread generated that response because it hurts people to see the players/streamers they support turn into that random guy in SoloQ who spent an entire game flaming them because they gave up first blood.  Their future enjoyment of Froggen's stream is impacted, their enjoyment of CLG EU's success is impacted;  you can denigrate that as being over-invested, but that doesn't make it untrue.  It's up to Froggen to decide if maintaining his popularity is worth learning to take in-game adversity in stride (assuming it impacts it at all, which it won't; see: Dyrus) or if he's fine with the reprocussions of the spotlight he willingly shines upon himself.
0	Okay, let's play with your scenario, moose. I'm earning $50,000 in, let's say, St. Louis. Say that makes me middle class there. Let's say I am paying 20% taxes and so I am left with $40,000. (I'm keeping round numbers to make it simple). I have a mortgage on a singles family home, a 3 year old car, eat out once or twice a week. I'm okay.   Now, say I'm in the outskirts of New York City with the same income. I'm renting a crappy apartment, can't afford a car, I'm lucky to afford McDonald's 2-3 times a month.   I am paying the SAME amount in taxes in both scenarios with a drastically different quality of life. The guy in St Louis is fine, the guy in NYC is getting "robbed" by the government because they do not take into account the cost of living where you live.
0	You imply that your job is difficult and only you can do it.  However it didn't exist previously and was created just for you  You refuse to describe what it is.  Sorry, but shuffling papers in a job created for you by someone you know / are related to isn't that impressive.   >> You should try it sometime   I put myself through a private engineering school earning a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering.  I paid my own way working full time and graduated without debt.  I've been an engineer for 16 years in the private sector where you must earn your way.  Jobs do not get created for you.   I work hard and I am damn good at what I do.
0	Im not opposed to charities advertising, and I agree with a lot of what that ted talk said (hadn't seen that particular one, but have read/heard variants of all the arguments).  I think that if you're looking at an organization with the potential to really change the situation for people, overhead is not a fantastic measure.   But I dont think make a wish fits that bill.  One thing that Pallotta never addresses is cause choice: regardless of advertising and overhead, do I want to be giving to soup kitchens or education?  Malaria or AIDS research?  I would hazard a guess that part of the reason he doesnt go there is that the two causes he has worked with--breast cancer and AIDS--are two of the most disproportionately funded causes out there.   But that is the basis on which I have issues with make a wish--I think that, even taking overhead out of it, they dont accomplish much.  This event may have outrageous fundraising returns, and may even push the 2% towards 3% for some people (though I doubt it--seems more likely that the largest effect will be to substitute one kind of charity for another.  I think the kind of change he's asking for on that front will take a much larger systematic change and be highly nonlinear, but thats just speculation).  But if the cause itself is not as impactful as other causes, then I think it is still a bad humanitarian investment.   I think the issue for me with the way that a lot of people are thinking about this is they realize (correctly) that this stunt raised awareness, but they don't consider what it raised awareness of.  I suspect the number one winner was Make-a-Wish, and if the best thing you can say about them is that they raise awareness and the thing their raising awareness for is themselves, then you're more or less stuck in an infinite loop of not-actually-getting-anything-done.   You can definitely make the argument that leukemia research might benefit.  I would be interested to see number on this (would actually be a really cool study if the data was available, see if leukemia research orgs saw a spike around the event.  Would want data on donations, website visits, and the location of donors).  But I would also like to point out the fact that leukemia is already one of the most survivable forms of cancer, especially for [children--now over 85%](   I actually think that in a lot of ways the Gates Foundation is a good embodiment of what Pallotta is asking for--they pay their people extremely well and hire out of top-notch universities.  They do their own analysis and dont rely on simple numbers to make their decisions.   But most importantly they are interested in the entrepreneurial aspect of charity--betting on risky endeavors.  And a huge part of that is having metrics to understand performance and what the potential performance is.  That allows them to maximize impact.  Some acquaintances are working for them, trying to determine whether schools that are taken over by independent, profit-motivated individuals and organizations do better, and the first part of that project was defining what was meant by do better.
0	because at that temperature level, you are losing the benefits of the marbling and quality of the meat. you are now tasting seasoning and burnt characteristics, and the firmness of the meat due to the temperature has negated the initial quality. you are now convincing yourself that it is a high quality steak, when in reality you have robbed it of its quality-indicating traits due to the level of doneness. it's fine that you like it the way you like it, but you can get the exact same flavors and texture out of a low quality steak as a high quality steak when you cook it that long.
0	You're free to believe whatever you'd like, but stop with this 'secular law' defines the world stuff, because the same secular law endorsed slavery not all that long ago, civil inequality. Today the same 'secular law' endorse social inequality through 'immigration law', lobbyist driven government, and turns a blind eye to abuse of American civil rights.  (Stop trying to put words in my mouth I said nothing about religious law, in fact I said the opposite, that many things are outside the scope of the 'law'.)   So back to the point since you've missed it coming up on 1/2 dozen times. There is 'secular law' which is part of the 'State' sphere, there is this religion, commonly referred to as the 'Church' sphere.   Civil rights, rights of the 'marriage certificate' fall in the 'State' sphere, which are governed and protected under the secular-civil law. 'Marriage' falls under the 'Church' sphere, and is a promised made to and before God. The value of marriage is NOT the piece of paper.
1	You just don't get caught by Darius, or let him get stacks of bleed on you. Let the tank keep him off of you while you take him out.

0	Umm, Reddit isn't a massive corporation and the proceeds from gold keep the site live and the ads minimal. Reddit Gold is probably the most creative way to get fiscal support from users, in that it's fun and non invasive. Imagine if you had to pay to post certain types of links or make self posts longer than 140 characters. Imagine if the site was littered with video ads and banners and pop-ups.
0	It isn't industry change that's the issue, though, you also need to take into account the rate at which the industry changes. Working in the computer field, I can tell you it's a very forward thinking industry. Everything we software engineers build must be scalable, and usually take into account changes in computer systems. It's not like anyone's invented a brand new way of computing in the last 15 years, rather we continually make small changes to existing ideas, so it's rather easy to keep up once you have your foot in the door. Welding, on the other hand, will either have no change at all, or change entirely. I am not a welder, nor do I have experience with it, but I can assume you either invent a new from of welding that makes older methods (and presumably equipment) obsolete, or there is no change. Sudden change you can't keep up with will make you lose your job. If slow, gradual change you didn't bother learn makes you lose your job, you have no one to blame but yourself.
0	I feel like my subconscious is always looking out for me in this regard. There have been countless people I have been introduced to, through very trustworthy friends, who later turn out to be a complete waste of a person.   Perfect example, a good friend (lets call him Joe) introduces me to a young girl about our age (early 20s, we'll call her Liz). I immediately know there is something I don't like about her. I could never tell what, exactly, but I knew that for some reason, her and I would not be friends. Joe and Liz have known each other for a few years, so they already have a decent friendship. Liz starts hanging around Joe's apartment more often, one reason being that Joe loves to have friends over, to play games, smoke, drink, whatever. So Liz is just one of the guys now, and just blends in. She's there all the time, even when Joe isn't, because she kind of lives there now.   Flash forward 3 months. My friend Joe finds himself in some trouble completely unrelated to Liz. Joe spends 2-3 nights in jail. Joe comes home from jail, opens his front door, and sees  nothing . His apartment is completely stripped. Big screen tv, gone. Bed, gone. Clothes, gone. Dishes, gone. Xbox and games, gone. Food, gone. Couches, gone. Lightbulbs, gone. This girl literally had a few friends come over and just loaded up trucks with his shit while he was in jail. Turns out she was a "recovering" meth addict when I had first met her. That status changed to "active" after a few weeks.   I hate that this happened to a friend of mine, but there was something screaming at me from my gut to not be friends with this woman. But don't worry, guys, we figured out pretty quickly who did it, and nobody hesitated to report her to the police. She served some jail time, I don't think she is still in there, this was last year.
0	I'd like to leave a little tip, here, for anyone who might see it, because of how it's changed my life.   I've struggled with panic and anxiety attacks for a long time. I first noticed cold sweat panic attacks around 8th grade. It's been a real problem. Sometimes I'm cool as anything, but other times it's fight or flight--that feeling that your panic is one step ahead of you and there's nothing you can do. My worst symptom is head sweating. My forhead, sides of my face... fucking torrents of sweat, which, of course, make it worse. I've never tried the doctor, never done any real therapy... just haven't. I understand most meds (other than antidepressants, have been on those) that might help me are going to be pretty extreme.   Long story short, I found this breathing exercise on the internet. I don't know if it's psychosomatic for me, but it has worked like fucking magic: 2 deep, 5 quick. 2 deep, 5 quick. I do it for a few moments, as long as I feel like it, and I swear it's like flicking a switch. It's like magic. It works so well that I am in the process of doing some further research into meditation, breathing, yoga... that sort of thing. But for now, 2 deep, 5 quick has been a breathing exercise that often stops my panic in its tracks.
0	That was my point, there aren't many actual studies on brains because it's unethical.   Let's say there was a pedophile gene (for simplicities sake) and we could test the whole human race. EVEN THEN that doesn't tell you anything about who your daughter/son is safe with because :   a) individuals have preferences....   b) being a pedophile doesn't mean you steal kids from the street, there are (most probably) plenty of pedophiles who don't do this. So we have to look for pedophiles with violent / immoral tendencies.

0	To start things off, I am on medication, so don't worry too much. I just need to vent, and take any advice.   This past November, on my home from my night class, I saw a kid holding the railing of the overpass crying. When I pulled onto the bridge, he slouched down on the sidewalk and buried his head. My first thought was to mind my own business and carry on, but within 50 ft of passing him, I made a U-turn and parked on the side of the road. I got out of my car and walked onto the bridge, asked if I could join, ploped down next to him. I asked him how he was doing and took the time to listen. We talked about how he moved here from New York after flunking out of art school, wanting to become a cartoonist, and how is parents in Ohio wouldn't support him anymore. He told me of his past drug habits, attempts to get help for his depression, his current living conditions, and his unsuccessful job prospects from not having a vehicle. He is only 19.   I shared my own experiences, right now at 22, about how I got severely depressed a year ago despite good things happening, how I got inexpensive medication and therapy, got a great job that I could live off of, meeting an amazing girlfriend, getting myself back into school, and buying 2 cars, all in about a year.   He slowly cheered up enough to walk with me to the gas station where I was parked, and then allowed me to walk with him to the townhome where he is staying with friends. I didn't push for his number to call him, but gave him mine instead. If he needed anything, just give me a call.   Since then, I think about it everyday. I've gone to the same overpass, stood in the same spot, calling myself a coward for not jumping. I got close a couple times, but it sure would have helped to have someone there with me. I worry if what I did was good enough to stop him, and if he is okay. I didn't wait for him to go inside the house, and knocking on the door for someone I don't recall the name of would be awkward as hell in that neighborhood.

0	This is how my parents did it.   Apparently me cleaning up was my biggest issue as a kid. One day when I was about 3-4 my parents told me to clean my room. I told them no and they said if I didn't, they would sell all of my toys at a yard sale to which I replied I didn't care.   That weekend they made me sell all of my toys. They made me run it, take the money, and give change (obviously with their help). I never again doubted their threats. When I was 14 I had gone to a friends sleepover and the only request was that I clean my room before I go, I of course didn't. The next morning I got a call from my dad saying my mom was going to my room in 15 minutes with trash bags and hung up. I never ran home more quickly in my life.
1	i was like that for 1 year,only watching streams/lcs ... Why? I didnt want to suck at it and destroy other people games ( i have a lot of bad experience in one other game with tanks and bad players) so i wanted to learn basics ...   I hit lvl 30 1week before s5 start and im curently in promo for s2,i still suck at mehanics (can only play j4,Vi and leona good,other champs not so much) but i think that my map awareness is better than most in my ELO.
1	Reddit a few weeks ago: Lucian is OP he dominates all the scene for AD Carries and he excels at literally everything   Riot: How about we nerf him then and make his range lower, that seems reasonable enough and to compensate we can make him even more ability based with lower cooldowns, more chase potential and lower mana costs   Reddit: OMG RITO RIP LUCIAN   Get a grip guys. You aint playing in the LCS, you can play any adc. If you truly enjoy the champion dont go being pissy because they got nerfed and just play your champion anyways. If there's people still playing Jayce, Zac, Cho etc. You can still play an ADC who's tentative nerfs could be way worse. This new cooldown and cooldown reduction for Lucian's dash might even make him actually have powerspikes rather than be good all the time, as he could end up having much more interesting combo's in lane that are much better early game. Sure, range nerfs are HUGE but they've given him decent stuff to compensate, from a trading standpoint he isnt that worse off and mid-late game he has the ability to reposition more frequently each fight making him hard to dive on as a bruiser. I understand Seraph's POV on this, but only as he plays at high elo. 90% of you guys are Bronze or Silver just like me, That's just common knowledge, and if you truly enjoy Lucian and main him like you say just fucking play him. The advantages at low elo from straight outplay far outweigh those from champion strength and none of you have even tried Lucian after these nerfs, why jump to conclusions?
0	Yeah, the worst part is it's not the same. Not only does the pressure of the water make it harder, the actor is usually  doing something active  and not sitting there, like me...watching TV.
1	Mystic Shot does not count as a spell. It applies on hit affects but not spell effects.   For example you can not benefit from spell vamp and life steal from mystic shot. Only the life steal is applied.   Teemo and Kayles e both empower auto atacks with a spell, so its not comparable to mystic shot. Mysitc shot and parrley are pretty unique in this because they are spells that apply on hit effects, not a spell effect on hit.
1	Rather than just telling you yes or no, have an anecdote from a game I just finished! (silver 3 ranked)   I was playing Shen top. Our team was Leona, Malphite, Ezreal and Lee Sin and we were teamfighting in mid. Malphite (jungle)  had ganked my lane 5twice and got kills since I was laning vs rumble and having a hard time of it earlier but due to some ults I went into this fight 3/0.5 while our malphite was 5/0/5.   The fight kicks off and leona is doing her job with Ezreal but he's kiting and she's peeling and they;re generally going okay. Meanwhile, lee and Malph are bringing the pain on the enemy varus/thresh/trundle and I'm going with them. But after the first round of abiltiies, and after thresh dies, I take a moment to look back and see that Leona is dead and rumble is overheating and charging down Ezreal. I make the split second decision to turn back, taunt rumble, vorpal blade ahri and we clean house with Ezreal living in time to catch up with Lee and Malph.   If I  hadn't  come back, ezreal would probably have died to some harpoons or a taunt from ahri and we would have been collapsed on hard with ahri's aoe/rumble's flamespitter and varus still being alive, and we could have lost that fight.   So whether to peel or not was situational - initially, no, I provide much more threat pushing their adc and jungler away from our ad and joining the dive, but as soon as leona died, a simple turning around and catching a taunt was enough to save our ad and take a probable 1/0 loss into a 2/0 win.

0	I put in 5 years at Office Depot as a part-timer.  The first 2 years were fine for me because I was still in school and part time was all I could handle.  After I got out of school I told them I wanted a full time position.  The boss said there were none available at the time, but he'd take care of me and promised I could get one after it becomes available.   Cut to 3 years later and I was still working part time there.  Looking back I should have left A LOT sooner than I did.  I had applied to a few jobs over the course of those 3 years, but never seriously sought after better employment thinking that Office Depot would surely hook me soon since I had been with them so long.   There was a small incident at work and tensions were high enough that it pushed me over the edge and I ended up quitting.  Sure, it wasn't the smartest thing to do considering I hadn't found another job, but I worked for Depot till I literally couldn't stand it a moment longer.   It turned out to be a blessing in disguise.  I began spreading out my resume and applications to lots of different places, but after speaking with management it wasn't looking too good for any of them.   After about a month out of work I was a day away from going to pizza hut because I knew they needed drivers.  I lucked out and got a call from a security company I had applied for.  They wanted to hire me to work a temp job for a power plant while it was in an outage phase.  The good news was that I was getting 60+ hours a week at a good payrate.  My first paycheck was 3-4 times what I had made in an entire month at office depot.   Things have been going so well with them that they decided to keep me and offered me a permanent job.
0	A lot of schools aren't bound by a particular legislation relating to use of inhalers at school which means each school is allowed to choose their own policy. The reason some schools banned inhalers was because they thought the kids would over self medicate or would allow their friends to try it out or whatever. Because of the kid who died they are now trying to implement a new law which forces schools to have asthma and anaphylaxis plans in place and to allow/force children of suitable age and mental development to carry their inhaler or epi-pen on them at all times.
1	Agreed! Definitely a fair trade: What I've found thus far is the slightly higher mana costs are negated by the fact you do so much ridiculous poke via your passive (which of course you can always pass off to your lane partner with an added shield to boot).   By level 3 you have a disable/slow via poly, an 80% slow + nuke that can hit both support and AD, and a shield that lets you pass off your passive to your lane mate. This all combines to make your lane  incredibly  frustrating to farm CS against & nearly impossible to stand toe-to-toe / trade with and come out on top due to so much quick CC so early.
0	I know it seems really silly to us, but clearly when you get that much Internet fame and you have an image to maintain and hold up, apparently it becomes very important to you to make sure that your posts are always agreed with and that your image isn't tarnished.   I mean, given the context, the results of that were pretty hilarious, but still some part of me can kind of understand why he did it... He just let Reddit fame change, as most fame does to a person.
0	Can I just, say as someone who currently works as a special needs educator, that this is literally the most popular opinion that exists? Maybe people won't say they feel this way but most people obviously do. I mean, there just is no funding. When education budgets get cut, special needs funding is the first to go because apparently everyone agrees with you.   There are a million points I could make about how wrong this is, but I'll just stick with the money theme: it ends up costing society a lot more to care for individuals with developmental disabilities specifically because the education budget is so gutted. If more people cared about providing a decent education to this population many students would acquire more effective life skills and better integrate themselves into society. Because this isn't often the case, a student may end up never learning to toilet themselves or tie their own shoes having to rely on multiple staff funded by the state for their entire lives.
0	An engineering degree, at least for undergrad, is meant to be more about teaching you how to think and solve problems. Problems that you are going to need to figure out how to solve, they aren't going to be in a text book, or on your test because they don't have a known solution. If they had a known solution you wouldn't need an engineer to find that solution. [This is a good quote from someone else in this thread](   As an example, in mechanical engineering your core classes are going to be (from [wikipedia](   >* Mathematics (in particular, calculus, differential equations, and linear algebra)     Statics and dynamics   Strength of materials and solid mechanics   Material Engineering, Composites   Thermodynamics, heat transfer, energy conversion, and HVAC   Fuels, combustion, Internal combustion engine   Fluid mechanics (including fluid statics and fluid dynamics)   Mechanism and Machine design (including kinematics and dynamics)   Instrumentation and measurement   Manufacturing engineering, technology, or processes   Vibration, control theory and control engineering   Hydraulics, and pneumatics   Mechatronics, and robotics   Engineering design and Product design   Drafting, computer-aided design (CAD) and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM)     Everyone that majors in mechanical engineering takes the same basic classes, regardless of the industry they go in to. None of those classes would present me with real world problem solving scenarios for the design of a car. In order to do that I'm going to need to do more research, then do testing, and modeling, and more testing, based on my research. Engineering is not something you expect to get right the first try, the best you can do is use redundant checks in your design process, that's why there is always prototyping and testing that goes on prior to the actual release of any product.
1	She is UP because she can't realy be buffed. She is a late-game orrientated champion, with a better lategame than Ziggs AND Nidalee.   The fact which makes me say that, is that Lux is super safe later in the game, her kit basicaly allows for no counterplay. She will just spam Q until she hits something that she likes, and then she will probably try to 1 shot it with E+R. All this, from 900 range away.   Add to that the fact that she has actual CC (nid doesn't) and her spells are AOE (nid is single target). She also has an AOE shield which will shield for stupid amounts late game (Ziggs doesn't have team utility).   So yeah, I think that he concept is broken and that's why Riot can't buff her. Think of the absurd fact that her E has 60 base damage at lvl1 with a 0.6 (?) ratio, while Gragas Q has 80 base damage with previously a 0.9 ratio, now nerfed to 0.8 .   If she had normal damaging spells, she would be broken as fuck, so her passive makes up for the lack of damage in her spells, which she can't use though due to the assasin meta which dominated S3 and seems to continue.
1	It's better than a last whisper if the enemy team doesn't build ANY armor, otherwise, last whisper is better. I've seen it work okay on Corki, Fiora good because of on hit, thought about it with AD WW. Basically, you get it as supplementary item instead of stacking bt's or pd's. I've never really used it, but when I do, it's pretty good, cause you shred.
0	yeah no problem. Cyborg_Bill already explained something that a lot of people don't know, that if someone's heart isn't beating (asystole) a defib will not get it beating again. the heart is a multi-chambered pump and the chambers have to contract firmly in a specific order for it to effectively move blood through the body. sometimes it gets out of rhythm and it's flexing rapidly but not in an effective way. that's called fibrillation, when the heart is kind of freaking out. a defibrillator stops the heart. kind of like when you hold the power button down on your laptop instead of doing shutdown. sometimes it's like doing a reboot and the heart starts working correctly again on its own, but a lot of the time you have to help it get started again with chest compressions. there are a lot of tv shows that get that stuff right nowadays. some actor will yell something and they will use the defib and then you will hear the flatline sound and they will start working on the patient to get the heart started again. it's supposed to work kind of like when someone is hysterical and slapping them is supposed to snap them out of it. but in some tv shows it's like that scene from Airplane! where they just keep slapping the lady and it becomes a joke. but anyway, about 20 years ago, AEDs hit the market. that stands for Automated External Defibrillator. the old kind, and they are still in use in many hospitals, may or may not have a built in heart monitor that you can use to tell if use of the defib is appropriate. but they won't stop you from using them if the patient's heart is working normally. you can shock someone with it if you want. those type were NEVER outside of hospitals or ambulances and NEVER supposed to be used by someone that didn't have medical training. some defibs are internal, meaning they have these spoon-like paddles that you can place on either side of the heart and use. they use less electricity, they are better at hitting the heart, don't damage surrounding tissue like an external defib does, but the chest has to be opened up. also there are internal ones where they chop you open and install them. older ones would have wires that came out of your chest to a box you wore, newer ones are computer controlled and completely internal. so that's where we get the letters AED from. the E stands for external, meaning it's on a wall in an airport or wherever like a fire extinguisher and not implanted inside people or requiring that you crack someone's chest to use it. the A stands for Automated, meaning the paddles are disposable flexible pieces that are also heart monitor sensors. there is a computer that takes the data and decides whether or not the patient should be shocked. if the paddle/sensors do not detect fibrillation, the AED simply will not fire. regular defibs have been around for decades, but AEDs are a fairly recent invention. when a defib is needed, it's needed RIGHT NOW and eventually someone designed one that some dumbass couldn't kill someone with. so then the defib companies began to realize that they could make a shit-ton of money selling them to anyone that doesn't want to get sued for not having one. the last one i messed with was about 10 years ago, but here's how it would go. somebody falls down at a train station or whatever. you grab the box off of the wall and open it up. it's got a couple of packs of sensors that you tear open and plug into the box and then follow the pictures on the wrapper to know where to stick the pre-lubed pads onto the person's chest. then you turn the thing on and it starts reading the heartbeat with the sensor/paddles. then it will say SHOCK NOT ADVISED if the person is not in fibrillation and pushing the schock button doesn't do anything. or it will say SHOCK ADVISED and you yell clear and everyone stops touching the person and you hit the shock button and there is a tiny click and some of the person's muscles tense up and that's it really. you might have to shock them again, but in reality after a couple of shocks the person's chest cavity is baked and a lot of damage is done to the heart. then when the montioring part senses that the heart has stopped it tells you to start chest compressions or whatever.
1	The only thing this changes is that groups have more control over who among THEM gets first pick.  If you queue solo you still have a 20% chance to get first pick.  The "group leader gets group member priority for first pick" does not affect your chance at first pick in any way.
1	Well, no offense mate, but in the laning phase you shouldnt depend on other to ward your lane. And as a jungler I always pink one of the 2 river bushes in mid, as I believe it is actually my job. Bot should focus on pinking their lane so I can gank.   Second of all, if you lose cs and get ganked just because you're typing you obviously aren't focussing on the right things. With all the cs you missed you could have gotten a pink, or green for that matter, and palced it yourself.   Thirdly, judging from how you are wording this here, the jungler probably muted you. You sounds quite aggresive, and wouldnt suprise if you flamed at him in what you thought were "reasonable request, or demands for a gank". If you are complain for a long time/persistant in your complaints (no matter whether they are justified or not) you will most likely annoy your team.   Also as a jungler I always try to gank winning lanes, or lanes they are going equal and would win when I gank. When you are behind on a Fizz I will not gank, Fizz will either 1) get a kill and get away or 2) get a double kill and buffs.

0	Also, the doe can leave the fawn for an extended period of time, or so you might think.   A friend of mine had a doe leave her fawn in his backyard for just over a month, he knew not to worry about it. His backyard ends at a cornfield, and the deer apparently feel safe in his yard as they bring the husks of corn into his yard to eat.   About three weeks in he had thought something had happened to the doe. One night, my friend saw the doe return to the fawn only to leave by morning without the fawn. After about five weeks the doe finally came to take the fawn with her.
1	I use to play her mid when she was flavor. It was VERY good back then because of multiple reasons. One, very linear meta where Evetakes advantage of. Two, a different kit with different scalings and her E doing magic damage. Thus making DFG very useful on her and a staple item.   She had the ability to pressure other lanes without hurting herself too much. You're probably wondering, well gee I do the same thing now!?! When her kit was over powered Jungle was a bit weaker with faster spawning camps, gold income for supports was lower, and junglers who focus on vision control were barely meta. You still lost a lot of matchups mid but you could easily slip into your jungle camps to farm it which pressured other lanes. You could do the same now but it's not good anymore as everything I mentioned is different. Right now it still takes a while for her damage to ramp up, so if she gets murdered in lane she could be made a nonfactor.   Now to answer your question, I've played her once mid since Ludens Echo and her E change. The damage change to her Q won't change my opinion. She gets outclassed by many other mids. You're also basically giving up your lane in exchange for better roams. Which as I've said before can be foiled and challenged. I however play her in jungle if I don't get my mid or if I'm doing 3s, I usually jungle. She has powerful ganks and more time for vision control with decent damage, which is why she belongs in the jungle and not mid. Why the fuck would you play her mid when you can play her jungle and not give a free lane and you can do what she does best. Gank pressure and vision control.
1	SYDTKO has a LOT of very strong and extreme opinions on a lot of stuff. I like some of them, I dislike some of them. But what I really like a lot about the kid is that he is one of the few accomplished players (don't want to start a discussion about wether he is accomplished or not, but I'm pretty sure he's pretty known among the community) who regularly think outside the box and are open to share their ideas with the community.   I mean, some of the stuff he says is pretty odd (I'm 90% sure I recall him calling jungle Singed viable pre jungle remake, I mean, come on.), but at least he's not caught in a fashion a lot of the other pros seem to be caught in.
0	You know, I thought for the first 2 years of my relationship that it was fucking gross to kiss my SO right after she had swallowed. Like brush your teeth. But you know what? She never complained when I kissed her after doing the deed to her so she force kissed me once and I thought to myself "Well that's salty and kinda what I expected. Whatever." And now, it's not like I want my fucking cum in my mouth but whatever, we kiss all we want. It's all love and disgusting bodily fluid exchange done with tounge transport.

0	You need more upvotes.  I almost quit Reddit before I found out you could unsubscribe from /r/atheism because of how horrible it made me feel about myself. I never questioned my faith because I knew what I believed and that I had every right to believe it, but even while trying to sensor out the bad posts I would accidentally click on one that seemed harmless and end up crying because the comments and general message made me feel like less than scum. And the cause was always two-fold, first I would be upset because of how the stupid ignorant people calling themselves Christians would make a mockery of my right to believe in God, and second because of the cruelty the generalizations of /r/atheism made about Christians.  It made me feel like less than dirt and I spent a lot of time depressed and miserable about it.
0	I think we've been (rightfully) giving shit to deadbeat dads of all stripes for years. The backlash against teen moms is really a backlash against the media's exploitation of teen moms as fodder for reality television and such. Its not so much that people see teen moms as trashy, but they see the exploitation of teen moms and the trends of teen motherhood in the greater population that come up as a result as being trashy. But this is Reddit, and the motto of the entire Advice Animals sub may very well be "Why use a scalpel when you could use a hammer," so you shouldn't expect a lot of fine-tuned criticism here.
0	Both of my parents spanked me when I was a child...the main thing I remember about it all was the terror I felt when I knew it was coming. I remember walking home from the bus stop with a detention notice (years after the last spanking ever happened) and literally praying that my dad wouldn't be there when I got home, out of fear. That's the attitude I carried pertaining to my parents until I left their house. I constantly lied and hid almost everything from them because I simply never trusted them. And honestly, as my dad did most of the spanking, I really feared him, but because my mom was on his side, I feared telling her anything because she might tell him. And this wasn't just when I got in trouble...it got to the point where I wouldn't even introduce them to my girlfriends. I lied to them about everything so that I could cover for myself IF something did go wrong.   I know this is anecdotal, and I'm not a parent, so I don't want to weigh in on whether spanking is right or wrong. But in my case, I think it went wrong. But the good thing that came out of it was a knack for getting out of trouble and getting around obstacles, even if by manipulative or dishonest means.
0	I'll tell you my secret, in an anecdote from just after I finished college:   My younger cousins parents were going through a nasty divorce.  He was living with us that summer while his parents got their shit together.  I took him out with me whenever I went to hang with friends or party.   Near the end of summer my cousin said this "John, no offense but; you are not the best looking guy in the world.  How do you always have these hot girls all over you?"   The answer is amazingly simple.  Be confident, be funny and be nice.  Even ugly guys like be can get hot girls if you are not afraid to talk to them.  Treat them like people, not objects and generally just try to have fun.  I think the having fun part is most important.  Don't try to pick up girls, just wherever you are have a good time, bring your own party.  Don't be afraid to look dumb.  Look dumb every chance you get.  Tell terrible jokes, laugh at yourself, laugh with others.   Maybe I have an advantage because overall I'm a VERY positive person.  When someone asks me "How are you today?"  The answer is always "AWESOME!  How are you?"
0	I'd beg to differ. Let's take the Skrillex vs opera as an example. Let's assume we have a way to accurately measure intelligence, maturity and other similar factors.   Skrilles has a much larger fanbase. There are people from all kinds of environments - poor and rich, educated and uneducated.   Opera has a small fanbase that tends to come from the same social layer - they're older and tend to have (at minimum) a bachelor's degree( Found this study to back that up) .   You could then only consider Skrillex fans from one social layer but then it wouldn't be a valid study anymore, because you're be ignoring a big percent of the audience.   I'd argue that the same tendency would be in other forms of entertainment. It only appears as if only 'stupid' people enjoy reality shows because 'intelligent' people would maybe be ashamed that they like it - given that reality shows are seen as being for 'stupid people' only.
1	It is nice to see that you took a lot of the criticism people gave you and actually worked to improve at if. I couldn't stand you in some of your videos when you were against gold players and outplayed them on riven and would basically fall of your chair screaming at the top of your lungs because you just beat up a little league player. Now I really can enjoy you as a person and a player much more because of your attitude you have matured a lot as a streamer and a league player I love it .
1	I have experimented some with leona jungle and some of my friends have too. We have never had a problem with her E. Being able to go through the jungle faster would increase her clear time, no doubt. But I don't think making it where her E pulls her through walls should count.   I understand that many junglers now have ways of going over walls. (J4, Elise, Amumu... etc) But there are still viable junglers out there who can't go through walls. (WW, Noc, Xin(must have vision to do so)... ect)   I think what would make leona faster at clearing jungle would be having the ability to pop her own passive on the jungle minions. This should only proc on jungle minions by her, meaning she can't pop her passive in lane or against enemy champs. The passive will still be there for others to pop, but she couldn't do it. This would increase her jungle clear time, and make her an extremely viable jungler.   I also jungled Taric for a while, amazing ganks, decent clear, just didn't really offer much late game. Leona would be much better late game then some junglers and can bring a large amount of CC.
0	Oh please. Of course it's all in your head. Confidence and comfort in one's own skin are some of the most attractive traits males find in females. Those wayyy outweighs looks for the average male. But moping around reddit telling everyone how ugly you are achieves nothing.   The reason something like this comes across as annoying is because there are probably thousands of males who would find themselves perfectly compatible with you, but the complaining that other girls look better would get tiresome. Mostly because none of us actually sit down and compare, we just like the girl we're compatible with.
0	On the flip side of the coin... I straight up  hated  my last boss - he was a complete asshole, a greasy douchebag, a patronizing, condescending, womanizing, narcissistic, underhanded, despicable excuse for a human being.  He was arrogant, clueless, manipulative, regularly ignored input and blamed others when it came back to bite him in the ass.  (Seriously, ask me what I  really  thought of him)   But ya know what?  I was always polite and respectful, I did everything I was asked and busted my ass to do a good job, even when he occasionally took credit for my work.  I never tried to undermine or back stab him & tried to be as fair & tactful as I could in the skip-level meetings I had with his bosses about his performance in the last several months.  About the only unprofessional thing I did was go out for beers with other coworkers at lunch or after work to occasionally vent about how awful he was to work for.   When he left (less than a year after being hired, and I suspect just before being fired), he actually made it a point to privately thank me for being so helpful while he was there and said I was one of the best people he'd worked with.  Soooo much guilt... and yet, thank St. Fuck he's gone and I'll never have to deal with him again.
0	Fun fact: Kerberos, the three-headed hell hound of greek mythology might be derived from the sanskrit word for "spotted".
1	As frustrating as these losses are, this is not an example of "trolls" in this game.   In the two cases you cited, you had one lane get completely dominated.  This can easily snowball to a team loss, even if you do well in the other lanes.   People commonly confuse unskilled play with trolling.  At low skill levels, and even higher skill levels, there will be times where someone gives up 6-7 kills in lane.  It's really too bad, and very frustrating to lose those games, because you feel like you played fine or even that you played well.  Unfortunately that is the nature of a team game.   Also, I doubt in the two games played, it was  entirely  the mord and akali's fault the game was lost.  It's easy to get caught and lose the game, and then blame someone who was feeding earlier to the game loss.  Sure they contributed, but in the end it's a team that loses not a single player.
1	Literally stopped playing Anivia when her Q got like that.   For those who don't know, her Q is a skillshot where she shoots a ball of ice which she can reactivate and it will detonate and stun everything in a small AOE. Otherwise, it detonates at the end of its range for the same effect. And anything hit by the undetonated skillshot is damaged and slowed very lightly.   In a recent patch (I haven't played her enough to know which one) they changed its targeting. Instead of being a skillshot which is shot in the direction of the mouse, it's fired as an AOE. Meaning that as you're running away from people (as squishy anivia is known to do), and trying to use your stun to self-peel, aiming too far away from your champion has Anivia straight up walk the wrong direction so the max range of the skill lands where your cursor is.
1	Sion/Warwick are THE BIG ones.... Champions like Nidalee and Cassi are just things that can be fixed with a touch up on the model instead of a full blown VU and kit wise it's not hard to just change the passive and change the numbers on ability scalings.
1	Cry and hope it will all work out.   In all seriousness: AD caster are very hard to deal with as kassadin. Zed, Kha'Zix being the most popular ones I'll explain these two matchups a bit.   Against Zed he'll try to harass you and might all in you at lvl 2, especially when he cheesed his lvl 2. Be aware of that and rather miss some cs earlier instead of dying to this. Go armor runes, if needed even 21 in defense and start cloth armor. Get your Seekers ASAP if you're lossing lane, if not delay is as long as you can so you can get your core (tear, roa). Zed can't really all in you at level 6 when you're fast on the fingers. If he ults you - silence him, riftwalk away.   Overall keep farming, watch out for jungle ganks and try to shut him down when used his W to harass you, if needed with jungle help.   For Kha'Zix that shit is tough, real tough. He basicly does exactly what you want to stop people from, bursting in a matter of a second before you actually silence. The same as above applies for Kha aswell, he will all in you at levle 2, avoid that by either pushing early or staying defensive and silence him when he hits 2.   Other than that, play it defensive aswell. One big thing you will need to realize tho, is that he won't do anything after he just jumped on you to harass you. He got his comb off, he wants to back off now. Slow him, activate W( W empowered AAs actually deal craploads of dmg) and silence him when his Q is about to come back up so he can't trade back again.   Since you mentioned Talon aswell. Talon is literally shitting on Kassadin. Play def, run 21 defensive, ask for ganks when he hits 6 you gotta hope you're tanky enough to survive his burst so you and your jungler can bring him down.
1	Truley angry players generally feel unjustly punished by being saddled with players below their self perceived skill level and no matter how well they play their team will always let them down. The mute button works wonders but on top of that, continuing to offer advice even while the flamer is muted will bring your team together.   Say mid is feeding 0/3 around level 6, you top Riven is "actually a Diamond smurf account" who's demonstrating his tourrettes symptoms through text. On top of muting xXBestBunnyBangaXx you also type to your team "I've warded their jungle exits, they'll be looking to take drag with their advantage. We can ambush them on approach." You can supplement a few words with pings but you get my point.   Strats like these can be pulled off without the raging playwr , they will usually work in solo q because nobody expects deep pink wards by someone who isn't support and seeing two careless enemies picked off will calm down your LCS qualified teammate.   I usually play jungle so this is one option. As a top or mid you can alternatively contest or ward enemy buffs for similar effect.   Then again, some people merely vent external life issues online, there's not enough APM to play well and host a therapy session. Just mute them and move on.
1	I'm spitballing here:   APC or AP Support vs ADC     AP items are more likely to make the user tankier than AD items are  (Abyssal, Rod of Ages, Zhonya's, Athene's vs IE, PD, BT, LW)   AP is cheaper to build than AD  (Long Sword +10AD for 360g = 1AD for 36 gold, Amplifying Tome +20AP for 435g = 1AP for 21.75g).   AP champs rely on skills, ADC's rely on basic attacks, and skill base damage rises faster than basic attack base damage   AP champs are designed to scale well for early-mid game, ADC champs are designed to scale well for mid-late game   AP champs are designed to do burst damage, ADC champs are designed to deal sustained damage     AD Bruiser VS ADC     Bruisers are likely to build resists early   ADC are NOT likely to build armor shred until late   ADCs are unlikely to build resists until late   Bruisers rely on damage from skills, not auto attacks  (for the most part)     EDIT
1	i'd like to thank the wonderful teammates i had and my dog who (i'm sure) supported me all the way. seriously, if you have teammates who don't rage at each other it's literally the nicest experience ever. unfortunately that's a one in a million chance but man, my days of shit luck finally paid off.   i got +94 ELO in an afternoon, literally the luckiest string of great teammates ever. if you queued with me yesterday, thanks a lot guys. ^^
1	The last time I had someone that said they were going to feed, I just did a printscreen of the chat.  I told the troll that I had the screenshot I would gladly play the game and let them feed because they would be banned afterword.  They ended up leaving dodging and I never saw them again (but I still sent in the screen).
0	Time to chime in on the topic with my own personal experience.   4 years of long distance here. Long, long, long distance.   I am from California and my SO is English. We met on MySpace(archaic, I know) and didn't meet each other for 9 months when she came to Cali, all while both playing it as a full blown dedicated relationship. We didn't see each other for another six months when I went to England. Then another 6 I went back again.   Cue extra seriousness... we planned a marriage. Building for getting married we spent a year and a half apart. All the while, nothing but Facebook and Skype to work with.   I landed in the beginning of July, this year, married July 30th. Writing this as she dances in her pajamas to my left.
1	Eh not necessarily what it says. I was writing a huge post explaining how the graphs should be interpreted but it got to 3 paragraphs and I was only half way done so I just gave up.   It's not necessarily a comparison to what the player "should have." It is simply an average (as you said). It's an average of eight teams, some of who may be doing what they "should be" with the distribution of gold while others may be doing something far differently from that. The average of the teams is not necessarily what the gold distribution of an ideal team "should be," in fact one might argue that TSM's gold distribution should be used as that indicator since they have the best record right now.   Think of it this way. Assume arguendo that the "ideal" ratio of a team that wants to win in this meta (it would depend heavily on the meta; S2 you would see an ideal team give perhaps 30% of the gold to the ADC) is 25% to mid, 20% to ad, 20% to top, 20% to jungle, and 15% to support. This ideal set of ratios is not necessarily the average, and if each team were compared to this ideal set the graphs would look slightly different.   Every time a team like XDG or Coast overemphasizes or underemphasizes one role or another, it changes the average that the other teams are compared to. CLG's graph can be a good example of this. Perhaps the "ideal" situation is as CLG has it (what looks to be somewhere around ~19-21% for each role around). However because of the way that some teams have chosen to emphasize gold distribution, the graph makes it LOOK LIKE CLG is underemphasizing Link.
1	Ah, story time.   'Twas a ranked solo queue game. And all through the Rift, fuck this I am not rhyming.   Anyway, this guy just randomly leaves in the middle of a game, comes back, and presents to us this statement.   "Sry guys, sis waz in showr i always fap to it. cant miss a day"
0	Actually, if you are driving with the windows down, you have to turn the volume up to be able to hear over air blowing around your car and through your open window.  At a light, when the car is at a rest, there is no noise from the blowing air and the music now sounds like it is too loud.
1	How much did your introduction to Esports mean for you personally? How did you parrents react? and what about your brother? Did you have to do anything to convince them? I recall playing with you back in season 1 or something like that, back then people knew you for being good, even tho you were 15(or something like that) and i remember i always facing you in the lane and losing, but to make that climb from just being an above average player to becomming a professional player, truly truly (outrageous?) impressed me.
1	Wasn't that the point of Mystery gifting?   To get a skin you might never use?   Maybe that's my outlook on it. I don't use it to get Pulsefire Ez or the Spirit Udyr Skin. If i want them I'll go buy them.   Would I ever buy Dyrad (spelling?) soraka? No. Would I play it if I had it? Hell to the fucking yes.   For instance I have all of the Malphite skins. Do I use them all regularly? No. Im usually insta locked on Glacial Malphite because it's my favourite. However on occasions I like Shamrock, or Marble (eventhough it looks ugly as hell imo)   It's about having different options, not about getting the skins you want.

1	Basically, the more unexperienced/young the player, the more he is likely to believe in some form of "KS" or another. Younger players are selfish and entitled, and will always view themselves as "deserving" the kills on any fight they are involved in.   More experienced players will understand that this is how the game flows. Ultimately, with more experience, you will learn to even "Donate" kills to champions that benefit or snowball more effectively, but the whole "KS" dimension disappears.
0	While it may seem like book publishers may be like scummy music labels, it's actually to the benefit of readers and literature at large. Like a music label, publishers hand out advances to a large number of writers with the hope that one book (50 Shades of Grey, anything by trash writers like John Grisham and Nora Roberts) will sell enough to make back the advances and more. Same thing goes for music, wherein one artist can pay back the recording contract costs of dozens upon dozens of failed ones. Here's the catch though: instead of being churned through a shitty industry where your work is constantly being pressured to sound a certain way by everyone but you and your bandmates, a publishing advance lets a great number of young writers experiement and write for a living and, by some stroke of luck and/or genius, actually produce a potentially canonical masterpiece. So having the traditional publisher-author relationship has actually been beneficial to literature at large and young writers hoping to churn out a successful debut novel or short story collection.   So yes, book prices may not be in your control, like music, movies and teleivison shows are by way of pirating and the subsequent creation of streaming services. But then again, while it's harder to pirate a book, the traditional business relationship benefits society much more. Because honestly, the last thing we want is an Amazon-controlled self-publishing system in which anyone and everyone can throw shit at the walls with no concrete, traditional system of value. Sure, some independent stuff is good, but as far as I'm concerned, the world of literature is not in a place where I need a crowd of people telling me what's going to be good instead of people who have actually worked with famous writers and helped them produce great works.
0	Some people can't find the way to operate some modern WCs. I was at Disneyland a couple of months ago and I had to go bad. There was a decent line for the stalls and one guy took the longest, when he finally came out it was my turn and he stood in front of the soor and looked at me with a deep shame. He wanted to warn me but he didn't speak english, I guess. I didn't have the time to listen to him anyway so I open the door and there it is: one of the longest turds I've ever seen. I realized he had spent the last 10+ minutes trying to find a way to operate the toilett because the sensor wasn't really working. I pushed the button and it worked perfectly. Since then, I have noticed that unflushed toilets are, more often than not, those with a flushing mechanism that isn't exactly like the one people have at home.
1	I'd rather see my exact rating(ELO: IE:1850)than some divisions and LP which sounds cool but has no relation to your MMR. (IE: Plat 5 with gold mmr)
1	Why can't we have a possibility of changing a champion when we are already in group? We would just change it, then if team captain approves we change champion, if he doesn't, we stay with an old one. If I join que as Jinx, and I see team could really use Sivir, why can't I do a simple change? I agree that que should start with picking role and champion, but that's it, after joining group I can just go afk, since there won't be any talking since we can't change our champions, all we can talk about is a simple plan for the game(so far in chat I've seen hoping for a missing player, nothing related to game). And since we can't change our champion, we can't adjust to potentially better strategy as we talked what we could get to make it a better comp. Right now when I que for team builder I feel like I'm wasting time, I have 10min+ que time in blind pick and it still is faster than team builder and has the same effect.
1	People are going to act like this is such an edgy comment when in reality its not at all.   Most teams would have to ditch most/all of their players to win worlds, you'd be delusional not to see it.  We've been getting decimated by the Eastern hemisphere, and you need to defeat them to win worlds.
1	A part of it is Solo Q. I know some people are going to claim that NA solo Q was fine, but if you watch a lot of pros stream (like I do), the environment has improved this season A LOT more. And its LARGELY contributed by Piglet, Huhi, Fenix, Impact, etc. These guys try super hard to win and its pretty contagious. The best game I saw was when I was watching Pobelter stream. The same 8-9 LCS players got matched up 3 games in a row and they everyone was trying super hard throughout the game. In addition to this, I also think there is a cultural difference in the way the games viewed. Mata, Poohmandu, Madlife, Lustboy, etc. In Korea, a lot of vocal/alpha males play the support role. In NA, and other regions, the personalities of the support roles are usually played by timid/quiet guys. And before you guys point to Aphromoo, if you guys can't see that he dislikes the leadership role, you guys have a bad eye of spotting personalities. I know people have tried to point out to Sheep and Bunny (tbh they are only good at Thresh), but I think Scarra was right (before he politely backed off on his statements) that NA doesn't have any transcendent support players. It's not that NA or EU doesn't have the skills to produce this kind of talent, but EVERYONE wants to be the next Mid/ADC superstar. You could argue that NA/EU have just as talented ADC's and Mid's, but the Supports/Junglers don't come close to KR. I also think KR is above NA/EU in terms of Junglers as well.
0	It happens with older mothers too, my mother actually.   My sister was 17 at the time and asked my mother WEEKS before to go to a movie premiere.  My mother decided that same day to go to a casino with my dad (Mother was in her late 30s by then) and said my sister couldn't go, leaving her with me (age 5) and my sister (age 9) in the house alone.   Well her boyfriend came over furious because my parents were being giant douches to her (always have been, my father disliked her for a long time since she was from my mother's previous marriage). She ended up going for a walk with him for an hour in the park while we slept. My parents got home before her and was pissed at her for leaving us alone sleeping.   I think they shouldn't have gone out, and it's their fault for being faulty parents.
1	This is why the Reddit hivemind is dumb. The comment is downvoted? Lol,
1	I am not sure why you are being downvoted, you speak the truth about a few things, although possibly a bit naive on MLG not focusing on money.   I am closing in on almost a decade of watching MLG events, as I have been watching since the Halo 2 days. I can honestly say that I haven't seen MLG slide back once in that entire time. Now I obviously haven't seen EVERY event, and  have  seen them make mistakes, but it is very rare that those mistakes occur more than once and if they do it is out of their control (e.g. Venue promises its' bandwidth can hold a certain load and fails to do so).   I am rather surprised that IPL slid back so drastically this tournament. It almost feels like they tried to take a lot of shortcuts this tournament I am assuming because they haven't met their profit margin goals or something of the sort.   All that being said, I am never against giving these companies the benefit of the doubt as I understand the extreme difficulty of live events and I really appreciate what they have been doing. There would be no eSports without the "Major League" events like MLG, IPL, Dreamhack, etc.   Hopefully IPL can learn from their mistakes and really pull it together for their next tournament. The biggest tragedy that can occur from these situations is when nothing is taken away from it, nothing is learned, and then nothing gets applied to future events.
1	No he missed Tibbers. Otherwise Shiphtur would have been stunned by an ability. You see, Annie's 4th ability will stun. That means when he spawns, he did E + Q + W + R. His R missed which means his stun missed.
0	Let me tell you how this all started. I was going to watch The Purge with some friends and that same day happened to be her first day at her new job. So she texts me saying "Some black guy was following me after work. I was taking random City Buses for about an hour and he finally left when I asked some guy to pretend he was my Boyfriend." Well I think this is a joke and proceed to tell her "I REALLY hope this is a joke." Well turns out it wasn't and she says "I can see how much you care."   Well the movie starts and I tell her I'm at the movies with some friends. She tells me "Ok I'll stop bugging you. Bye" I ask her "Do you want me to text or come over to your place after the movie?" She never replies.   Around 11:30 she starts another conversation with me. While we're texting, I get on my Facebook on my iPhone. She has logged on her FB account before so I guess her information was saved on my phone or something. Well I'm on my account and my phone freezes and sends me to my home screen. I simply click on the FB app and I was logged in as her for some strange reason. Now this is where it gets weird, already being magically logged out of MY account and signed into hers, just as I was about to log out and go back to mine, she receives a message. " I can't help it, you have a nice body."   I read the entire conversation. She was the one who started texting him with "Hi buddy". It all leads to some joke they have or something:   F:I bet you were outside my window watching me. M: I was and I enjoyed watching you shower. F: Then why didnt you come and join me? M: I cant. I would be tempted to do things. M: I cant help it you have a nice body!
1	Not if you understand statistics.   He had a 88.6 or whatever ratio simply spamming punish. There's 2 things to take from this-     Of the cases  this individual  judged, that punish rate was significantly high.     There is also a decent chance that 2 or 3 cases per day were very close to borderline. Looking at my voting record, I woud say that cases labeled 'Majority' or 'Minority' are close to breaking even, given the presence of 'Overwhelming Majority', 'Strong Majority', and other modifiers. Out of the 77 completed cases I've reviewed since the Tribunal update, 18 fell into these categories. Thats more than a quarter of the cases that were decided by only a few votes. Back to this case- If all of his punish spamming tipped the scales in favor of punish, it's going to artificially inflate his percentage correct. I'm not sure exactly how many people judge each Tribunal case, but I would feel safe in venturing it's not more than 10-15 votes per case
1	Actually  the fact that you stated thit concern in the first place prooves that now you are just saying "I dont " just to disagree and not because you really dont do/would do/would like to do it.
1	She just has long sharp claws instead of nails..  Look at it from this perspective: Fizz: Is a shark Color scheme: blue/aquatic colors Void fizz: Is a void creature (maybe he fell into the void idk) Total color scheme change. All abilities changed. Ult is now a piranha plant from hell.   Now look at lux: Is a human Color scheme: sunshiny/yellowey Now look at skin idea: Still a human Wearing a different rope + different staff, still has human aspects (such as blonde hair)   It just doesn't work.
0	I have atheist friends, Christians, and friends of other beliefs... From a Christian standpoint it doesn't really matter what anyone believes... Jessus didn't just hang out with his 12 apostles, he would leave them and minister to the prostitutes, the tax collectors (thiefs basically), criminals, and the sick.
1	Realistically speaking, CLG has slim to no chance of ever winning worlds. They do have potential, but I doubt that it will ever be reached due to the attitudes that arise in the team chemistry. The only non-Asian team that has done exceptionally well against the Asians was Gambit Gaming. IMO, despite their lack of time to practice together due to their own personal lives, their ability to approach LoL and their team with a professional mindset is the reason behind their ability to play. They may become a top NA team, but I don't see them becoming world tier.   Also, this boot camp that was talked about is something that is done normally in Korea amongst the pros. A day consisting of 16 hours of not solo queue, but practice has been the "go to" style of training for many of the gaming house's in Korea, regardless of whether they are playing LoL or SC 2. Assuming that all the pros have relatively the same amount of talent, the NA scene is being completely eclipsed by Korea in terms of the amount of practice that is put in. So, it is only natural that the rest of the regions looked down upon the NA region during the Allstars.   Now, the only NA team I see that actually has a shot at getting even close to winning is Vulcun and this is due to their currently evolving game play. The reason why they were able to go 5-0 was because none of the teams were used to the changed play style. This is obviously with the help of very solid mechanics. However, this can also be the reason why they can lose in the World's as everyone there has the same disadvantage of not knowing how to play against the other teams.   The reason why I did not say Cloud 9 is because they have a Korean style of playing the game and how can the 'fake' (lack of a better word) beat the original? Sure they might be doing well in the NA scene, but if any top NA team were to get toyed with during the World's against the Koreans, it would be C9. As the Koreans in general (not just one team) have put in way more time in perfecting this play style.   I for one, cheer for TSM. I wish that the NA scene would take this more seriously and refrain from practicing through solo queue. If they are able to focus purely on 5v5's I'm pretty sure that they would be able to come out on par with the other Asian teams, maybe not Korea, but China and even Gambit Gaming.
1	I am stuck in Bronze, I won like 7/10 of my placement matches while my Silver cousin had only won 4/10. I was doing great until I lost my promo because I had a game wit ha leaver and a game with a feeder. Since then I am on a massive losing streak, in which I am getting put with and against Golds and Silvers. I think the whole ranking system is fucked up and needs to be fixed.
1	Lets say turret his for 25% damage first hit(not too bad) and has 10% armor pen if an adc has 2200 hp with around 40% damage migration from armor after penetration then the turret is hitting him for around 200-250 ish(hoping my math is right). Not if this amount scales per attack like it currently does then after 3 hits he would be taking 350+ a hit every second. The amount of life steal and attack damage/speed would be very high to sustain many hits.
1	Pardon me for shitting on your gold, but this doesn't really show forellenlords true potential nor is he at his best in these plays, HOWEVER the plays he does make is way above what 99,9% of the lol community could ever even dream of doing. The video showed decent high elo clips, some better, some worse, fancy editing with a tasteless title aswell as quite poor choice in clips. I've personally had the pleasure of playing against forellenlord, and he's a consistently great great player. You'd rather want to play good in 100 games than great in 50 and bad in the other 50.   Sorry for the massive rant and the terrible formatting,but i just feel like people are getting the wrong idea by watching this movie. I think you should aim to include top plays only, if you are to make a showcase/tribute of any sorts. This should however appeal to the majority of the lol community, just try to be a bit more original and to put a little more thought into choosing clips.
1	As far as the roaming counter jungler goes I am afraid its old news, the original roaming counter jungler was eve if I remember correctly, she would start smite/ignite and steal your blue and attempt to kill you straight after. It is pretty popular actually M5 recently did this but I can't remember when or who it was against, what I do remember was Gosupepper (m5's support player) took alistar it was assumed was a regular pick.   What M5 did was pure genious, with an urgot bot and a shyvana, (I think I am not 100% sure) they invaded the opposition's blue and gave it to urgot allowing him the capacity to 1v2 from there ali and shiv went around ganking and jungling and it pretty much gave them the win.   The real genius play was in my opinion to pick Ali, whilst other champs are suited to this role as a roaming counter jungler Ali has a few traits that make him especially suited for the job.     Inconspicous pick, you see an ali being picked up on a support player you assume he is going to support, and do not prepare for the counter jungling and roaming that is about to occur   High base damage on his spells.   Excellant ganking potential.   Is very strong even when underleveled this is important because he did drop behind in levels quite quickly which on someone like shaco would probably mean he would be too squishy and may often die while ganking.   Can himself jungle.     The other picks were of interest as well shyv has an ultra fast clear time meaning when she is partnered with ali they can blast through the jungle quickly. Urgot was a solid pick just because of the 1v2 and of course he got the early game blue. I don't remember the mid and top picks I am sure they had some synergy with the rest of the team they are just not essential for the strategy.   My favourite play was when Gosupepper went into the oppositions wraith camp flashed over the wall and headbutted the enemy's mid right into M5's which turned into a kill pretty fast.
0	This happened to me a few summers ago.  Circumstances were that she was smoking hot and had recently broken off her engagement and was in town for the weekend, and I was briefly single when my then-girlfriend said we should be on a week-long break (a la Friends). We went out for drinks, maybe a few too many, and then ended up back at my place and I swear I had to pee every 5 minutes, which meant no sex.  We did pretty much everything that doesn't involve a working penis.  She left my house in the morning and I haven't seen her since (as I mentioned, she lives out of town), and has since gotten back with the guy she was engaged to and I was back with my girlfriend.
1	If you really want to climb the ladder pick the role you can play best instead of support. You may get AD Carries that aren't as good as you so playing support is kind of pointless then.   It's also the role with the least impact on the game and I would not choose a playmaker support like Alistar or Leona until 1500 elo because people may not follow your engage.
1	My problem isn't the wrongful chat ban stuff...I've been chat restricted a few times and did I deserve it?  Probably. However, the only time I'm verbally toxic is when I am being trolled by someone who is ACTUALLY ruining the game. Now these people will probably never get banned, but I sure will. Usually goes something like this:the whole team is doing well and everyone is having a good time then top lane keeps pushing too far and getting caught, I ping him but he doesn't listen so I say hey hecarim why don't you group with us we win in team fights. He says fuck off no help top lane gg I'm feeding now. I say dude wtf don't be a douche. After he continues to feed and troll I message all chat and say plz ban hec he's trolling they obviously respond with no he's just having a bad game. End of the game and I report hec but get 3+ verbal abuses from hec and the other team...
1	People dismiss them because Dignitas hasn't done well, but they have played pretty well I think. I don't know if they are the best or second best or anything like that but I think they proved even with their shitty results that they are at least pretty good compared to the other NA bottom lanes. They 2v2'd Piglet and Xpecial and 2v2'd Turtle and Lustboy despite losing the game pretty convincingly. People will cite lane unfavorable lane match-ups and shit but part of being a good botlane is picking decent match-ups that help a team comp too.
1	It's actually a hard match for Cassio. You need MR runes/masteries. You need to zone out/harass LB 1-5 (this is hard because it depends a lot on your/theirs junglers). Start clearing creep waves fast knowing she can't really last hit that well at tower nor aoe clear them. Wait for mid-late and collect elo. Max Q first.   Really, if it would be 1v1, it would be an ok match-up, but considering jungle... it's much harder for you as Cassio.
0	He's doing more than any other MILLION people will do, or can do. He's been so generous with his money that it's too bad he (OK, Microsoft, but still) had to waste so much on an army of lawyers back when they were targeted by good ol' Uncle Sam.
1	Not totally agree.   I recently did a game as Vlad against Jayce at top lane. I quickly died 4 times (ganks, dives, mistakes...) and lost turret.   After this, I was underlevel, underfarm. Guess what I did? I fed "on purpose". I mean not really, but I just pushed the lane 24/7 farming all I could and keeping pressure on their top to prevent him from roaming.   By doing this I died 3 more times, going 0/7, but I think it was totally worth it because I was not worth that much gold any more and could farm so easily.   After destroying their top turret, the fed Jayce was really overconfident in his ability in killing me and I killed him thrice and caught up to the level and farm.   I ended up winning the game with a 13/7 and enemy team was flaming each other so hard (Jayce thinking he was a boss and his team's fault for me being fed).   What I am trying to say is that feeding is not a big deal if you do it  properly . I had some luck that my team didnt flame me because they could have done it and this would have lost us the game.
0	They're called single-issue voters. Another example is when all they care about is gay marriage. It's a matter of focus, not reason or proportion or rationality.   Another example is republicans and libertarians. They'll say they hate welfare, but ignore the much bigger corporate welfare, unless it's Solyndra, etc.
0	Life isn't fair, its a lessons I learned while I was getting jumped by 15+ kids and had to literally be kicked into my head, the next school year I punched the first kid that started up with me, I lost that one and won everyone after that. Bullies don't stop existing just because you don't fight back, If you live in a society where you don't teach men to stand up for themselves you do your society and injustice because a bully isn't going to not punch you because you don't fight back, the only reason china took Tibet is because they knew that Tibet wouldn't fight back, that's why when china tells Taiwan that they belong to them, and Taiwan says "come fucking get me" china backs down.
1	Number of bans does NOT need tweaking and the fact your complaining about the game just reiterates the stereotype that all  the league community does is complain. I dont understand how you can watch a broadcast from last year and not see the improvements made. There will always be something for you people to complain about. A game can NEVER be flawless. This game and its broadcasts great (great casters, great analysis, they show replays, good hosts, good interviews, decent camera work) show some appreciation for the work the ppl at riot put in. To say something is inexcusable is ridiculous, nobody forces you to play and you dont pay to play so nothing is inexcusable. Just stop watching and stop playing. But you wont because you know that the game is good and you like the broadcast you just want to complain about something.
1	I aint anything like that , I am the type of that that is tall , has belly fat yet I am really athletic ( top of the class except for doing shit like flips then I am average ). I am a strong guy but I am also a guy that is considered idk ... Chubby ? well no ... I don't even know what the word is. I call myself Fat cause honestly if I had any motivation I would lose weight really easily but I don't have the motivation and since I ripped some of my muscles on my legs and my achillies heel it has been tough losing weight cause most of the time it is just pure pain instead of stamina problems. I am a Muay Thai fighter but I stopped cause with Muay Thai and other martial arts , you put your body weight on one leg and since that just hurts too much for me to handle more than 30 minutes I can't do it. Running I can do maximal of like 2 minutes untill it starts to destroy my leggs and I have to take rests every 2-5 minutes and massage my legs. Thing is I am trying to lose weight but with everyone just saying that I should lose some weight it get's even more depressing cause it aint so easy trying to work out with a handicap like that.
1	my absolute worst throw was with WarWick.   We were all about level 14, and I had a full core build with WarWick. I had my team push mid and I started soloing baron. Had to down to about 2k hp and enemy Jax comes and finds me at 1/4 hp. Freaked out so hard I smited it down to like 200hp, and died. Went from a pretty great game to 4v5 teamfight and free baron.
0	There's an organization called "Jews for Jesus" that is made up of Christian Jews. And really, if you're going to follow Christianity you actually should be Jewish. The rules of the old testament are for Jews, not for Gentiles. So, you can either half-ass it and just follow the New Testament or decide to also follow a bunch of rules that don't apply to you by leading a Jewish lifestyle along with following Jesus. Either way is an odd way to practice Christianity.
0	It's not a universal truth -- I'm not sure there are very many of those to begin with, but it is a good tool to show 'youngsters' that MONEY IS NOT EVERYTHING.   I've been poor (like most people have at one time or another) and I've earned six figures consistently for many years -- so I do have some perspective on this.   Although I've never made millions of dollars, I can attest that there is some truth to the study.   My experience has been that after you reach a point where your 'basics' are covered (Housing, Transportation, Food, Clothing, etc) everything else is just 'stuff' -- but it can be stuff you want.   You want that expensive car, that comes with expensive maintenance. If you want a nice house you have to put nice furniture in it, etc...so as you make more money and buy more things you end up having more expenses and liabilities which makes you think you need to make more money...it can be a never-ending cycle.   The study essentially says that once your needs are taken care of, additional income doesn't come with additional happiness -- I think u/consonantcrisis explains it pretty well - there is a definite drop-off between income/happiness once you reach a certain point.   I know many people will scold me for saying this, but if more people had less concern about money I think this world might be a whole lot better.
0	I can't really agree with your comment here.  I think the United States is choosing to get involved for several reasons (political and economic included), but Obama's intentions are for the most part to help the people of Syria.   The United States government has chosen to not interfere in the vast majority of problems in Africa because their is no government on which they can focus their military might.  Without a strong figurehead or organization to attack, managing conflict in Africa would be disastrous.  Many of the problems in Africa stem from their own governments being to weak to protect their own people from warlords and profiteers, and that is not grounds for us to go in with military might.  That is why the vast majority of what we do in Africa involves financial and medical aid.   Going back to Syria however, I look at it like this:  the last major human rights violation that we let the United Nations deal with on their own was Bosnia is the early 1990s.  Because the United States allowed the United Nations to attempt to resolve the situation, and waited so long to intervene, an [estimated 200,000 people died](  The problem with trying to let the United Nations deal with human rights issues is that they lack the military power and resolve to deal with issues like those in Syria.   All this being said, I do not want to see my country involved with this conflict at all.  Allow the United Nations to deal with it, no matter the cost in human lives, and it brings to light the weaknesses more obvious in the United Nations peacekeeping force.  Thought it may cost tens of thousands of lives, it will ultimately make the world a better place if the United Nations becomes capable of resolving the problems it was put in place to take care of.
1	I have two problems with Maokai.   1) He is afforded to build damage early. His base stats and his kit allow him to remain pretty tanky early game while building a Rod of Ages, rather than rushing tankier items like Glacial Shroud into Frozen Heart or Negatron for a Banshee's Veil. Most tanks would barely benefit from building early damage, and they would sacrifice a lot of tankiness for it. Maokai can be very scary the first half of the game, because his Rod of Ages will allow him to dual-role as a team sponge who also hits very hard.   2) Twisted Advance. It is too good. Too, too good. Think about tanks and their initiations. What do they have in common? They can miss. Cho'gath can initiate like a boss. How? By nailing that perfect Rupture. Malphite can initiate equally well with an ability that is slightly easier to hit with (still possible to miss), but as such, it takes up his Ultimate slot. Blitzcrank can grab the enemy carry to your team, but only if the stars align and the enemy carry is reachable past the rest of the team. Amumu can only snare the squishy if, again, he manages to get that skill shot RIGHT onto the hiding carry, otherwise he bandage tosses to a beefy out front and gets kited, unable to ult the carry. All of these things are ways that a tank initiates, and you have to nail it. Maokai doesn't. His initiation is a targeted snare that relocates him to the target. That is way too good. With flash, it is very easy to pop out target-snare the enemy carry, then use the knockback (granted, it is a skill shot, but once you have used Twisted Advance, missing with this ability would have you shunned forever). That is far too good for the inability to miss.
1	You can always just add people that you deem at the same skill level as you on those games.   I started playing this game with some IRL friends and people from my WoW guild. After a while I realized that many people I hanged out with IRL played as well so started playing with them as well. Though, playing with the same people will improve your skills most of the times it may not be the case for others. I have a friend who is always the same, never evolves. And it's gotten to the point in which he's far behind on skill compared to the rest of us. So take that into consideration.
1	I play AD almost exclusively and I noticed something after many, many games.     Graves counters Vayne - He wins the laning phase hard and can snowball out of control. As Vayne: If you can stay alive until late game you'll do more damage than him given time and the items, but you may not get the chance. Save tumble to avoid Buckshot if you can. Farm your ass off.     Sivir counters Graves - Spellshield his Buckshot, Boomerang Blade/Ricochet him, his harass is predictable.     Vayne counters Caitlyn and Ashe - She can tumble away from Caitlyn Q, and her mobility and damage makes her a huge threat. Given equal items, it's unlikely you can trade with her unless you get a lucky crit and she doesn't or you have a sustain support and she doesn't.     Caitlyn counters Kog'maw - Not only is her harass super effective against Squishy Kog, but Caitlyn wins lane a lot like Graves. You can't stop her from farming.     Corki played well is an asshole regardless of who you are. A mediocre Corki isn't a threat to anyone. That being said, it seeems like his skill curve is pretty high.     People play Miss Fortune/Ashe? - You need a team that can capitalize on Ashe's ult, MF still sucks after her buff.     Tristana effective against a lot of people, brutal late game. I don't see many people who know how to play Trist effectively though. There seems to be some confusion at lower ELO. If you can avoid her at 2 and 6 and just outfarm her her midgame isn't as strong as a lot of champs, and if you can deny her kills all game her late game isn't that hot.     Ezreal - See The Oddone's commentary on Ezreal. He's just not a threat anymore. I haven't lost a lane to Ezreal in a long, long time. His skill shots are easy to avoid and his aggression is predictable.     Kog'maw I don't play Kog, I don't think he's very strong anymore compared to the other choices you have. Sivir, Vayne, Caitlyn, Graves and Tristana are better picks than Kog'maw imo. I'd probably even take Ashe before I took Kog.       I've countered Sivir as both Vayne/Caitlyn but it's hit or miss. Easier as Vayne than Caitlyn. One thing that's not very well understood is that regardless of who you pick, your support knowing how to play efficiently and productively is VITAL. There's more to it than being a 0cs healbot. There's more to it than warding. The AD doesn't make plays, the support does. The AD's job is to farm and recognize and capitalize on engage opportunities.   Your support knowing who to pick to synergize with the AD Carry (Alistar for Vayne/Trist, Soraka for Sivir/Graves, Taric for Caitlyn/Sivir specifically but generally anyone) is nearly as important as who you pick. Some synergize better with others. A surprising amount of people play support without actually understanding how the support helps you win the lane, or they just pick any old support without knowing WHY they picked what they did.   Here's what I mean.   Trist/Vayne and Alistar - Kill Lane. Their high burst and mobility allow them to capitalize on the openings that Alistar makes. How many times have you seen a bush camping healbot Alistar and raged because he was about as helpful as an asshole on your elbow?   Caitlyn/Sivir/Graves and Soraka - Farm All Day Lane. You don't need to get kills because you're going to win your lane hard regardless of what the other team does. They can't out-sustain, they can't poke you to death. This is NOT an aggressive lane. It's REALLY hard to fuck up in this lane with a good Soraka. Even if you do, chances are you're gonna live anyway. If you can last hit like a boss and control the ebb and flow of your lane you're going to enter late game stronger than the other teams bot lane. However, how many of you have seen a Soraka that levels Q first, and stands behind you healing you intermittently while spamming Q? It's not pretty.   Caitlyn/Sivir and Taric - Another kill lane. I'm not saying the other champs CAN'T synergize well with Taric, but these two do it best in my experience. Taric is a funny support. I don't like him nearly as much when I'm playing Vayne/Graves.   Insert Champion  and Sona - This is super hit or miss. Every champ synergizes well with Sona if the person playing her plays well. I've seen Sona's do nearly as much (if not more) harass than the AD. I've seen her be more responsible for soul crushing lane dominance than even Alistar.   Insert Champion and Janna  I hate Janna. She's not nearly as effective a support as Sona/Soraka/Taric/Alistar in my opinion. The only time I'm even remotely worried about her is when I'm on purple side and I can't secure bush control. I hate being in lane with her because I've never seen a Janna in over 800 games as ranged AD and thought "Man I'm glad she was in my lane". Her whirlwinds is nice for knockup/harass but pretty easy to dodge. I'm incredibly bias towards anything that messes with my control of how much damage is being done to the creeps though. I don't want the support "helping" me damage the creeps unless we're pushed into the tower and then I want one (and only one) AA on each of the caster creeps.   Sometimes it doesn't matter if you counter pick effectively, if you can't CS, you can't balance harass with last hitting, your support isn't aggressive, doesn't ward, doesn't secure bush control, if their jungler has more presence in lane than yours, if their mid lane can roam and enter your lane. You can have the most amazing combination ever and you can be 40cs ahead you still may not win your lane. The biggest mistake I see AD's making though is leaving their lane when their turret dies early. Ward your shit up, keep farming, don't stop farming ever. Don't wait for a huge wave to build up either. Ward the possible jungle approaches and pretend your turret is still there, if their jungler/mid wants to make their presence known, disengage and wait for the lane to catch up.
1	I main support too, and I'm in Platinum now. My technique is that I will snowball my lane by winning hard, getting early kills before the enemy jungler comes and without our own jungler, so the jungler can help mid and top instead. Right after the enemy tower goes down, I would shoot straight to top or mid to gank, and get a couple of kills there.   Dominating early dragons will help your WHOLE team too, so they don't have to rage after feeding, and they can accept that they will get carried by you.
1	I have to say, one of the things I do is watch the pros play in soloq. There's even an addon for google chrome. I found that it at least improved my ganking as a jungler; I dunno which adc streams there are, I think maybe robertxlee? Idk that's just something I heard.
0	My brother told me this joke when I was in 7th grade. I did not understand it at all. As time passed I grew older and one day that joke popped in my head.

And I can finally but my mind at ease because in my age I finally understand it.
1	He's not a great pick ATM. It's like this, if you are a strong Shaco player, you will do well with him still, but you have to max E first now, pretty much always, and strong Hp stacking bruisers are pretty much in every game. IMO Shaco is really best at just destroying a person's game, and with the nerf's to his early game making it much harder to get a kill w/o burning ignite or something (y'know, before they go back and buy a giant's belt) he's just a really unsafe pick.
0	Long term romantic relationships work out when both parties are best buds that are fond of knockin' klogs together and can share their passions and ideas openly with one another. My parents made the mistake of having the romance aspect down but not the foundation of a fulfilling, honest, warm friendship. Don't be like them! Divorce is fucking expensive.
0	There is a less than 7% success rate because a typical CPR patient is an 80 year old elderly female with a history of congestive heart failure and a load of other problems. With children the success rate is much higher due to the fact that it is not usually a cardiac issue but a respiratory one. Children will shove anything into their mouth and a CPR course will teach you how to handle this situation when your child is still conscious by performing the heimlich and CPR when they become unconscious.  Usually for children if you fix the respiratory issue they have a higher chance of survival. CPR is generally intended to keep the brain and tissues alive by circulating oxygenated blood by manually pumping for the heart. When you go into cardiac arrest your blood is still saturated with some oxygen. It never happens that you see a person spontaneously jump back up from CPR.

0	Your third and first points ignore the fact that we have a federal system of government, not one national government. For a long time many states did have official religions, but thanks to the arguments of Madison and Jefferson, opinion moved away from that. But you are absolutely wrong that it would absolutely be considered unconstitutional. The First Amendment was intended, in part, to prevent the FEDERAL government from obstructing STATE churches. It's not obvious even that the Bill of Rights applies to the states (as they mostly had their own bills of rights, and thus weren't even sure a national BOR was necessary), and later Supreme Court rulings are, contrary to your bluster, quite equivocal about the extent to which it applies.   Speaking generally, we can never get rid of the problem of having to deal with the wishes of the majority, no matter how many institutional checks and balances, and paper barriers, we put up between them. There is always the problem of tyranny of the majority-- it is always going to be pushing its pushy morality on us. And make no mistake about it-- despite what they say, gay marriage proponents are just as sanctimonious and moralistic about their opinion as gay marriage opponents, if not more so. Think about how angry they get if you disagree with them. That is not a sign of cold rationality, about an equitable distribution of benefits. It's a sign of moralistic passion.   So yea, you get special benefits if you're married. So what--you get special benefits if you buy a fuel-efficient or electric car, too. Government is allowed to use its taxing and spending powers to encourage or discourage certain activity, and while it usually makes some sort of argument about why that's a good idea, it doesn't have to.  There are some kinds of benefits that don't fall under those categories-- like you said, legal rights, like visitation, power of attorney, etc. But as these are conventional arrangements made by the state to recognize the presence of the family in civil society, I see no problem with them being discriminatory in the classical sense about whom to confer these rights on. On married couples, not on boyfriends or girlfriends. Not on the bestest of friends even if they are closer than any spousal relationship. If whole classes of people are being inconvenienced by these arrangements, I see no problem with them being changed by majority-elected legislatures, but there's no reason to get all moralistic about it, call it a civil right, ostracize and calumniate opponents, and congratulate yourself for your forward-thinking.   As for your second point, your argument is debatable, and the time frame is extremely narrow, but it's irrelevant anyway because gay marriage is a symptom, not a cause, of both prosperity and social upheaval.

1	For the CLG vs TL series the only reason for the bans is that TL didn't want to have to deal with his mid-game. Although, i think it was a pretty weak ban as Link under-performed in the one game he got him in the series. The difference between the series of CLG vs TL and GV vs TIP is that it looks like GV and TIP might have been scrimming with it. This is seen through TF not being banned in the first game of CLG vs TL, but thereafter his bans for the rest of the series.   I don't know how to really explain it with GV vs TIP other than the two teams had been scrimming each other and it came up as being played quite often. Currently TF isn't really a meta pick but he has good synergy with some meta picks.
1	Sivir nor Banshee's should counter a good Vi. A good Vi would ult them until they knew both were down. As a Vi main the best way to counter is postioning. If I have to run through 3 to get to APC or ADC then I'll die. At lower levels though APC and APC just wonder and end up at the front. Too easy.
0	How I deal with this (field tested; it works):     First time you get interrupted, let it go and wait for an opening in conversation.     Second time you start, use different words, so it doesn't sound like you're repeating yourself. Also speak a little louder and more clearly.     If you get interrupted again, clear your throat loudly. This is a polite way of saying "I have something to say". Say what you were going to say, but use different words, so it doesn't sound like you had to repeat yourself.       Tips for success:     Don't get frustrated. It won't help, and just makes you look rude too. They're probably just self-absorbed, and didn't mean to be rude.     If what you wanted to say wasn't that important, let it go. You can always jump in the conversation later, and you'll save yourself stress.     When you clear your throat, do it as if you actually have something in your throat, not as if you're trying to get people's attention. It is more effective, and less rude.
1	I know this is pretty much just an advertisement and is edited so, but I really think one of the main reasons Korean teams are one top of the esports scene is because they truly treat it professionally.  All the players seem to be well spoken, and even talk remarkably well mannered and even tempered during a match.   Half the American pro players I've seen just seem like they haven't grown up and matured past high school (granted some of them aren't much older than that but neither are the Korean players).   I can't remember who's LCS blog recap I read the other day, but it read like a 14 year old text message conversation.  Even in interviews a lot of the best American pro players just come off as completely immature and sound exactly like the 9th and 10th grade students I teach.
0	It's not just psychology and emotions, though. Human sexual differentiation is based on hormones in-utero, not chromosomes (as is the case for chickens; which is why you get things like  gynandromorph chickens   In most cases, XY will trigger the production of male hormones, and XX female hormones. But if things get in the way of that transmission, or if the chromosomes are not the standard two to begin with, you might end up with an XY foetus bathed in more female hormones and vice versa, skewing their sex and gender development from the norm.
1	You're always matched up with teammates/opponents based on your hidden MMR (which is essentially equivalent to what your ELO rating would have been in the old system). This can go up or down independant of what league you are in. What league you are in irrelevant to the matchmaking engine, and with the inability to be demoted once you reach a new league this is how it should be  (prevents someone from ELO boosting up to diamond league and then ruining games for much higher skilled players forever once they get back on their own account since as long as they keep playing they will never be kicked out of diamond).

1	Short Version: Riot's current Ranking and League system, because it is poorly tuned and has a massive blob of players stuck in one zone of its ranking system creates an incredibly negative and un-enjoyable experience for a significant portion of LoL's population. The current system only serves the Top Tier of players in any decent fashion - it essentially leaves the rest of the playerbase out to dry. Its nature actively discourages improvement, rather than encouraging it.   It was at the top but didn't say
1	A point that I would like to say is that in the sense of the skin itself, it is by far superior to any other skin made, technically is has everything and more than PFE has.   As IronStylus said however, one of the key parts of an ultimate skin is the thematic change, which SGU IS lacking. I personally do not care because it is literally a work of art and is incredible (just think, it is 12 models and sets of animations instead of the 3 that PFE had). It has been worked for the past 13 months apparently and I think the detail of the skin shows it.   When you say that it is not an Ultimate skin, you are just looking too much at the theme. I personally think it would be stupid to make a robotic Udyr skin or some other theme... Also it is difficult to change the theme of Udyr so much because his abilities are specific animals and changing the model to say something like  wolf instead of tiger (as people had suggested a northern theme) would not be viable due to the fact that it is a completely different animal.
0	You realise most rapes aren't stranger dragging you down an alleyway style right?   It's more like you have some cash and you've got some friends over for a party. Good friends. Friends you've known forever. And then the party winds down. And as one of your friends leaves you give them a dollar because you like them. And then they're all gone except for one friend who saw that, and they want ten dollars, so they hold you down and you say no, but they don't listen, and you say get off and they say shh you'll like it. An d eventually you're just lying there crying not doing anything because they're stronger than you and they haven't listened to anything else you've said and it will all be over soon and you can go shower. And then they take the money and leave.   And then you tell someone. If you're lucky you'll get someone who'll listen and reassure you that you were in the right and they didn't have the right to take the money.   If you're unlucky you'll get someone like you. Someone who says well you shouldn't have shown your money, you should have hidden your wallet better, you should have told them to fuck off. You should have chosen your friends better. You know people can't control themselves when there's money around. You probably secretly wanted it. You were giving off the right signals.
0	My dad got me a world map and globe when I was 6. We would play a game where he would spin the globe and stop it on a country, then I would have to name the capital, or the other way around where he'd name the capital and I'd name the country the city belonged to. I sat near the map so I could look if I couldn't get it but after a while I pretty much had all of them memorized. Overall it really sparked an interest and willingness to learn growing up, and I have my parents to thank for constantly giving me these intellectual challenges that to me just felt like games.

1	Olaf is defiantly strong vs riven, but the thing is she can still e, auto, w, q, auto, q away q away. This has the effect of farming and harassing olaf while at the same time absorbing a nice portion of his damage with the shield. (Cource this makes riven invest more in shield generally, she is not free of harass, and it pushes the lane like nobodies business)   The thing is, Riven CAN do this. Olaf if faced with a similar situation does not have as effective of a kit for when he is zoned.   This isn't "meta" so much as it is; there are junglers, if they hover top for 3 min and completely zone you (or even less) how well will your champ do now that you have a big (or small) disadvantage. Irellia and Riven or Mundo are very good at this, Olaf is not (Though he is not bad at it)   Another example might be Nassus vs Jax. This can be a very close matchup depending on how it is played. If the Nassus runs full lifesteal to start, and builds defenses he can generally out sustain the Jax for a large portion of the early game (Pre 6).   Now if a Shaco camps top and when ever the nassus get anywhere near the creep line, shaco jumps out jax jumps and stuns into shaco box fear, the nassus is going to have a hard time. PS: wards wouldn't help as much shaco would be jumping from skars jungle.   Lets say the nassus's skarner comes top and brawls with the shaco but the shaco gets away. Nassus is now down a level. If this is Pre-6 then when Jax hits 6 Nassus will be zoned forever because Jax overpowers him so much at that level.   Why do we play Nassus then, because Nassus brings some powerful skills to the table late game, and because he reaps great benefits from just sustaining and farming.   Olaf is not a strong top lane, much of his sustain is based on hitting things so without pushing the lane or drawing minion agrro he does not heal much passively.He has a nuke that deals true damage, this means he can generally win trades with other melee tops. He has a ranged ability he can use for farming, but the ability is costly in use of mana. His ult gives him the ability to ignore cc which is rather useless in lane.   That said, top lane gives olaf much needed solo exp and solo gold, this allows olaf to be on the level of champions like the opponents AP carry and their AD bot. Olaf's Ult and His high damage nukes allow him to run through a teamfight absorbing cc and destroying a squishy. This makes him a very strong pseudo assassin and initiator.   Thing is If Olaf cannot farm top he won't be able to kill the squishy, and his ability to initiate drops dramatically. He is not good at keeping that from happening.   EDIT:
1	I would say that this is essentially a buff in disguise, but I could be wrong.     New Passive - Buffed version of E (doesn't alert enemies) now made in passive form allowing WW to out-duel any champion in the game and easily stay on top of them at level 1 simply by taking either Q or W first which would give him huge sustain on top of extreme movespeed. Level 2 will be even more of a stomp, when he has Q and W.     Q - Flat damage was reduced, making it worse in the jungle, but better in lane. Took the AP ratio off in favor of an AD ratio, as well as reducing mana costs and adding a percent missing health aspect. AD has always been better on WW simply because he is so good at sticking to enemies and sustaining. Putting an AD scale is only a buff because people rarely build him with AP, and the percent missing health will rack up damage quickly and provide Warwick with an almost certain kill on any champion below 50% health due to his new passive stickiness and increased damage Q (giving increased healing).     W - Unless you failed to mention that W would still only have half effect for allies, this is a huge buff for W, giving allies the same bonus attack speed at level 1 (40%) that it normally would at level 5. Warwick's old passive was also added (though it does 1 less magic damage and healing per hit at 18). With blood scent on an enemy it would also give him more attack speed than usual at level 5, and with max CDR he would be able to keep W active permanently (as he already can), meaning he never needs to build an attack speed piece.     E - An added spell on low cooldown also scaling with AD and costing low amounts of mana. With an AoE effect Warwick can now quite easily splitpush at will, and will have increased damage in teamfights even more so that solo lanes.     R - Not a buff on damage, but it can also make Warwick significantly tankier, yet I still consider this a nerf to his ult, besides its new symbiotic relationship with his passive and thus his other powers.       I expect that if this were to go through we would see a top lane Warwick begin crushing people.     The low mana cost and spammably low cooldwon of E will allow him to build certain items that will cause him to wreck lanes, discussed more specifically later.     His Total AD scaling, low cooldowns, and percent health damages (both missing and max) will make him deal large amounts of damage without building significant damage items.       Perhaps his most overpowered feature is the items he will now be able to build.   *We already know that building BoRK on Warwick allows you to bring many characters to 50% health rather quickly. At this point in live you would only gain the benefit of your increased movespeed and reveal, but with the new changes he will become nearly unstoppable at this point, gaining low cooldown percent missing health and increased attack speed as well as increased armor and magic resist if you haven't already used your ult.   *The low cooldown on E will allow Warwick to splitpush lanes and also proc sheen passives quickly and easily along with Q. This will mean that he will not only be able to easily push minions, but also quickly destroy towers with Trinity Force (even quicker than currently with W). This tactic will be hard to stop because on top of this new excellent push Warwick will also have the ability to duel almost anyone in the game, meaning teams will need to send at least two champions and creating a nearly unbeatable splitpusher, similar to where Tryndamere was not long ago. This will also increase his damage in fights, either with Iceborn Gauntlet or Trinity Force.   *The low mana cost and cooldown of E will mean that Warwick will easily be able to stack a manamune (which some people already do, but with Q it is much more risky and much harder). Manamune toggle is destructive with Warwick's R already, but the new changes will make a high risk high reward piece into a low risk high reward piece that will be bought on every Warwick ever.

1	I've played about 100 LB games, I'm not an amazing player so I'm not going to say that I'm totally correct, but here is what I have found to work against me as LeBlanc, and for me when playing against LeBlanc.   Leblanc relies on her W to do all the work possible. You as a laner have to take advantage of this. After she W's (unless she has her ultimate), it will have around a 9 second cooldown at level one. This window is one of the best opportunities you are going to get against this godly mid-lane burster. If you are going against a Leblanc I would recommend you buy an MR item because of the ridiculous amount of burst she has, this will make her confused when she realises that she suddenly cast burst you with a full combo.   Keep your distance is another thing I would suggest. Using champions that can get CS from a large distance away (Except for Ahri because that's when you're going to have a bad time) are usually safe from LeBlanc. Ideal champions for this are ones such as Nidalee (for the heals), and I have found that AP Ezreal can also be strong to just arcane shift away from her Distortion after she has used her Sigil of Silence. (I'm not trying to say that AP Ezreal is good, it just works okay against LB). Similar to this, if a Sigil of Silence is used on a Zed, he can shadow away easily before the distortion lands. So most champions with quick blink/dash escapes will be able to stay clear of her damage   As a further note, using champions that contain loads of CC such as Galio (also for his mana shield health thing....), Ryze, Sion and Morgana are a strong way to catch her off-guard when she has distortion'ed towards you.   Lastly I just want to touch on the one champion that LeBlanc (along with almost every champ) will not be able to deal with. Lulu is a really good pick against LB. If you know how to use your shield defensively, most of her damage early will be negated and she won't do as much damage. Along with this, if you can land an E, Q combo onto her as well, you will find that you are almost doing more damage to her than she is to you; and all of this is without even mentioning the ultimate that Lulu can bring from nowhere to negate a burst champion's damage.
1	just look at the minimap whenever you aren't doing something else. there's not ALWAYS a last hit. There's not ALWAYS a harass opportunity. It's in these brief moments that you glance at the minimap.   Also, when you look at the minimap, don't just look at your ward to make sure nobody is there, glance with objective. Are all of the lanes accounted for? Are one of the lanes positioned to head your way? Is your support using CV? If so, what buffs/camps have been cleared by the enemy jungler? What you're trying to accomplish is to predict when they might head toward your ward before they even come within vision range of the ward.   Map awareness is improved by playing at least 10-20 games of all positions and roles. When you understand the role you can understand what they'll be thinking. Their mid was full hp/mana and just pushed to tower when you're overextended bot? They're probably coming to gank or steal your buff.
0	OP, you are a perfectly logical special snowflake who is clearly much better than most females out there.  Here, let us shower you with karma so you can continue to feel better about yourself
0	Alright you seem really confused so I'm going to make this as simple as possible. I saw the meme, thought about the angry sex that OP was missing out on, and came here to comment about it. Then when I looked at the comments, jack_in_the_mox had already said it. So i complimented him on his comment. Plain and simple.
1	Restrictions are based on your reports over a certain percentage of your games. The time period doesn't MATTER AT ALL. This is the 10th thread I've seen with people not understanding this. In your last 100 games how much did you afk or bm. It could be over a long period of time. If you  pass certain threshold then you will get punished. Its maybe 1 in 10,000 that is innocent (if there are even that many people who get punished). If you're getting restricted you're part of the 1% and its time to realize you're doing something wrong.
0	You could always skip to the bottom and check? I do.
1	Roy Hibbert was one of the reasons why Pacers had such an amazing record on the first half of the season. Went on to play like shit up to the point of having a 0 point 0 rebound game on the playoffs in 18  minutes of play, for example.
0	I was once hanging out with a mixed group of friends. Anyway, someone throws on some porn and the girl I had been flirting with throughout the night says "Wow, that guy's dick is pretty thin". About a porn dick! And she wasn't even joking. Anyway I excused myself and got the fuck outta there. She would have been telling all her friends that my statistically slightly above average size cock was a micropenis.
0	I just think you should allow yourself to broaden your own mind. The act of jacking off for a guy IS gay regardless of if you are acknowledging it or not.   Listen to yourself.   Someone else says "I like to get a blowjob by a guy, but since I'm not attracted to them, I'm not gay."   Someone says "I sleep with men, but I'm not attracted to them mentally. I'm not gay."   You jack off at the encouragement of both men and women. It's a bisexual activity at that point.   Call it what you want, but getting pegged is as gay as two lesbians with a strap on is gay. It's not the action, it's the 'actors' involved.
0	You should be proud that he was able to extrapolate the lesson to a direct object. Now he could say I love you lamp and know he was talking to the lamp even if he doesn't understand love.
1	Jinx had a lot more hype because thy kept on giving us little sneak peaks of her over time, with the C in Caits lore, the vandalism on Vi's page, and all the madness on reddit, by the time people saw who she was everyone was already hyped. On top of that, Jinx is really unique and Riot even released their own music video for her.
1	Which isn't really common in any elo below plat...I can see it in diamond and above, but then again they know what they're doing, so it wouldn't really be a common issue.   Most likely if your case were to happen, it would be because of x amount of player(s) picked a champ they wanted where the other y player(s) didnt want. But you would still need 4/5 vote for it to get carried through. And if it did who cares about a 3 min que? I'm in gold 2 and only once or twice all season someone on my team dodged out of team comp issue.
1	If you duo bot, you have 1% chance to win the game. That's why so many people do it.   Cause they love to lose.   They actually WANT to lose.   They know you. Hate you. Want you to have a bad day.
1	As another colorblind player, I feel your struggles. Though I don't understand why you're being so aggressive about this in the comments. I know it feels like it, but developers aren't purposely pushing us away by doing shit like this, they just don't realize what mistake they're making. The people in charge of Riot's colors are crazy TBH, I mean blue vs purple. Really? Anyways, yeah having the numbers available limits the inconvenience, but it'd still be nice for everyone to see the circle.
0	Respectfully, I disagree. Many crappy posts conform to their respective subreddit, but I reserve my upvotes for those posts which best exemplify the goal of the subreddit. For example, a goal of Advice Animals is to be funny, so I upvote posts that make me laugh. If a post on Advice Animals is not funny at all or is too confusing, my downvote helps to maintain the subreddit. A "First World Problem" meme may refer to a problem that only those in the first world deal with (and thus fits the criteria of the meme and this subreddit), but if it is neither funny nor engaging, it should not be allowed to rise through the ranks. But I'm no expert, just an enthusiast... I could be wrong.
1	Jiji used to regularly get at least 3k viewers, so it is probable that a large amount of his current group of viewers are fans. Chauster did not stream as frequently as Jiji and when he did, he didn't get as many views.
1	Darien and language barrier were the main problems probably, darien's playstyle and his team confindence even if he feeds alows Alex to play some champions with high damage output.
0	I have a lesser version of this story.   I volunteer as a youth leader for my church's local youth group. As a leader we have our jobs of keepin control of the students at the catachism meetings(they're all in high school, so they're my peers). Seeing as they're my peers, a lot of them think that they don't have to listen to me since I'm not older than them.   One particular night, this girl didn't want to listen to me when I repeatedly asked her to stop talking. I asked her to move her seat and she refused. We argued quietly for a good couple of minutes and I pretty much gave in and told her she could not say another word or I wouldn't hesitate to call her mother. My boyfriend(another youth leader) saw that I was having some trouble with her and he came when I told her "no more talking" and he kicked the leg of her chair (not violently, I mind you) and said "please don't talk anymore, or you will be moved." she was quiet the rest of the night, thankfully. So we thought there were no more problems.   I was wrong. After the meeting ended the girl and her mother barged into the leader office and started lecturing me on respect and what she expects taking her daughter to an extracarricular religious program. I tried handling the situation the best I could but she kept interrupting me. My boyfriend came over and referred her to the youth instructor(the hero of the story).   When the instructor came and saw us trying to calm her down the best way we could without pissing her off, he immediately took us all outside and Disgussed the problem. He immediately started telling her that we weren't violent people and by volunteering in the program, we sacrificed our time for the kids and we deserved more respect than what we were getting from her. She tried to interrupt him but he would just talk louder or tell her "I am talking!". After she was still being difficult, he told us both "you can go back in the office".   Once he called us back in, she was apologizing profusely for coming in so angry and yelling at us. It was the best time I've ever been defended for something like that.
1	Tbh this all made sense and was agreeable up until the last bit. A few things   "Young troll boy" can be fairly vague, and similarly we don't know how trolls age. It may stand to reason that Trundle was maybe in the troll equivalent of his teens when this all happened, and that many many years have passed since the story told in his lore.   But there's little reason for Braum to be a watcher and it just devalues him from a characterisation perspective to give him such an uplifting personality when it's all a facade because we only get to see and play with the facade.
1	What you write (and what the analyst says) is by no means in contradiction to what the OP has posted. Quite the opposite in fact. It's the simple rules of supply and demand in economy. The lower you set up the prices, the more people are going to buy your product because the price is in range of what is acceptable for them. The magic is in the fact, that this relationship is not linear and companies need to find the balance where they make the most money. So setting the rune page price lower would 100% sure help it's sales and probably the monetization percentage figure overall. The question is, how it would influence the revenue and (because the costs are unrelated to the product in this case, because it is virtual) thus the profit.   Also the analyst does not recommend other games price like LoL, because such pricing works only if you have such a high player base. But he doesn't think about the fact, that maybe LoL has such a high player base partially due to the setup of their pricing.   BTW: I also pay money for league. But I only pay for value-added items, like champs and skins. Runes are just numbers. I don't find value in numbers.   Edit:
0	One of my favourite lectures when I was at college opened by the teacher explaining how the book we were reading was all about interpretation, and how people can have different opinions of the world around them.   Scribble, scribble, scribble.   He then went on to given a 45 minute talk about the text. "This bit is  important " he'd say, and then detail something which  completely  undermined and misread every portion of the book, even to the extent of making up whole sections. The narrative is all about the protagonists innate sexuality. His desire for fulfillment from his mother. Vengeance for the death of his sister.   But still, the students went  scribble, scribble, scribble.   And at the end, whilst a few of us were giving each other sideways glances, a bit unsure as to whether we'd even read the right text, someone raised their hand. They said, and I quote, "you're talking bollocks, aren't you?" (we were British).   And the teacher replied, "Yes."   A few grumbles, a few complaints, and then he carried on. "Go back and read the bloody book, and don't trust everything an old cunt like me says."
0	I appreciate that you're trying to help out and it's a good thing you put your disclaimer that you aren't an expert, but your information is kind of not on the line.   For a beginner, as much as with anyone else, training should consist on what the person wants to do. It's why you have people who do SS or Blaha's 5x5 deal where the point is to do low reps and such.   As for the weight, if you're starting, you can probably increase by 5 every work out or two with rest days occurring at a day in between, for a beginner.   Now this is how I started my training, but I formulated it off of YT fitness (Blaha, Isuf, Hulse, McCarthy, etc.), browsing /r/fitness, /fit/, and BB forums. As well as talking to the weight lifters at my gym
0	This is a thing. I was going 95 in a 70 coming from Texas into Oklahoma. I had already passed 2 police officers. Both of them were small town cops, they never moved. The third cop I passed, who was Highway Patrol, had his break lights flash which I assumed was him shifting gears. I immediately reacted and pulled over before he could even get off the median.   He gave me a warning for 10 over which prompted me to ask what did I do to avoid the 25 over ticket. He said because I pulled over immediately and he didn't have to chase me very far.
0	It really depends on which is the active object on the website. With HTML5 that doesn't matter too much but with Flash, the Flash object needs to be the active object.
0	Did it a couple weeks ago, broke up a few weeks before that. Obviously painful, but only because the reason we separated was she didn't feel it was "the right time." She had just gotten out of an 11-month, relationship about 4^1/2 months before we got together, practically engaged relationship and literally less than a month after we broke up, she's dating another dude. For reals? It wasn't the right time after almost 5 months, but 1 more after that and you're good to go? My feels... :'c
0	Good Guy Greg   Knows you're veg*n   Doesn't fucking bitch you out about occasionally wanting to eat with him as part of a social gathering, doesn't make you bring your own food when he's cooking for everyone else, doesn't make constant comments about how delicious his steak/burger is and ask if you want to try some, doesn't tell you how ridiculous he thinks your choices are, doesn't bring up your veg*nism then drown you out as being preachy when you explain how you feel about something that's important to you, doesn't be OP.   Go fuck yourselves preachy asshole meat eaters. Go fuck yourself for every time your heads have exploded when you invite a friend to dinner and they say 'Hey can we go to that place where I can order something from the actual menu, so I don't either feel like a fucking asshole asking for a modified meal, or just give in out of social embarassment and fear of controversy and eat another 'salad' composed entirely of lettuce and tomato,no dressing, since if we're all going to pay to go out somewhere and treat ourselves part of the enjoyment of going to a restaurant is, surprisingly,having a bang-up meal.. but fuck me, amirite?"   Sound like you're all a bunch of whiny wallaces who only want friends who agree with you or shut up. Fuck that. You all think you have the right way to live, eating omnivorous diets, & that's why you're butthurt and veg*ns sound preachy to you. Well we feel the same. Every time I meet someone who feels passionately about something but is afraid to bring it up because they feel like talking about it will make other people more strongly opposed to the idea because they say you're taking a tone or immediately judge you as trying to convert or critisize them, I cry a little inside. Your friends have beliefs & whilst it's okay to challenge them every now and again to keep them on their toes and stop them just mindlessly believing things, why would you want to put them down for just having a different opinion on a morally grey subject?
0	Frankly, I love gay pride events. Get out, go to a gay pride parade, get shit faced with some old queens, make a day of it.  Washington DC is fucking awesome during gay pride events, be they the parade or the notorious(ly fucking hilarious) Drag Race at Dupont Circle. Yes, they're being loud and proud and obnoxious: it's called a culture of difference, celebrating the ways that your culture does not reflect the status quo. It's a healthy reaction to being a minority.
1	Let's just wrap this up:   Blitzcrank's W is made to give him the opportunity to reposition quickly to get a hook on a high priority target off. What his W gave him was an escape/engage/reposition. This change reduces the W's use to only reposition, because you won't be moving anymore either way when you hook the enemy, you wont even feel the slow.   All your comparison videos and all these comments tell me that you actually want his W to be an escape or engage skill. Well, having this as an escape or engage is probably what makes Blitz so ridiculously strong in the first place.
0	when gas is cheaper, ppl don't care about cars conserving gas, auto manufacturers go back to making cars that get bad mileage, morons buy them anyway when gas is underpriced, they need more gas, environment dies, planet dies.
1	You are absolutly right, but putting it into op's perspective of "making a difference" Soraka just doenst do so unless your AD carry knows EXACTLY how play his lane( doubt it).   I actually made the experience that with "stunning" supports its way easier to help win the lane because its hard to miss 2 pings and the visual of headbut+pulv or Taric stun. Stuns are super strong vs uncoordinated lanes, dont forget, your enemy is just as uncoordinated as you are (unless duo).   If your AD mate didnt followup the third stun you prepared for her, chances are soraka wouldnt have done any better either because this AD obviously doesnt know how to play her role and hero correctly.   I just wanted to wage Sorakas safety against the downsides of that hero, dont want sorakas for the next 2 weeks just because everyone thinks soraka is the one and only choice =).
1	Riot always cheers me up. The company is just so likeable. We love you Riot.
1	I'd like to say something to the community if anybody cares to read. I'm from Argentina, 21 years old and i've always loved video games, specially online video games so i could play with my friends and speak to strangers.   I've played millions of games from mmorpgs to mmofps and lots of single players classics, i played every single day, that was my passion, still is, i can't help it. One day, talking with some of my gaming friends, he says to me -"Hey, we should check this game out...-". We were always checking games out, because we loved to. Unfortunatly for someone that lives in Argentina or the rest of L.A. you will have to get used to the fact that every single game you try, you'll have to try it with >200ms as latin servers are not even close as popular as North America or EU servers. Anyway, as we were used to that, i answered -"Meh... why not?"- not knowing that it was that game the one who i was going to fall in love with for the rest of the following years and that would turn out to become the most popular game in the world. Since that day, i've never wanted to play anything else than LoL. The competition in this game is huge and i love competition so much that it's impossible for me to quit it.   I and my friends started to get really into it and would spend days and nights playing, having a lot of fun and trying to become better players. We thought that having a high ping (around 250ms) was not a problem, that it was not holding us back in any aspect because "we were used to it" LOL. That was because we didn't know how having less than 50ms felt. Once the BR servers came up recently, i tried with a new account to see how the ping was like there. You people that have around 40ms every game probably already know: a TOTALLY.DIFFERENT.GAME. It killed us the fact that we were playing with such a disadvantage and transfers were not available to BR at that moment and we knew that L.A servers would never come because we had never seen a game with that server location. I'm pretty sure this happened to at least 90% of the latin community.   We've been waiting so long for this to happen that we thought it would never came, but it's finally here! 3 Years! The moment when i can tell my friends "Guys, we are not going to play League with 250 ping anymore!"   Let's try to make this new community the best one! For those people from another countries that are still waiting for a server, i wish you the best of luck and think about it, with L.A covered now you are most likely to be the next ones! Hold tight!
1	Idea:   Get over it.   Seriously, this might seem a little rant-y, but this topic is showing up over and over. But, to give a bit of history of the reddit complaintrain.   Complaint: LOL the client suxxorz. Reddit Post Frenzy: LOOK I AM A DESIGNER AND I MADE A NEW CLIENT Reddit Post Frenzy Responses: LOOK AT THAT DESIGNER THAT MADE A GREAT CLIENT IN LIKE 2 DAYS, JUST MAKE IT WORK.   Action: Riot begins to release 'client upgrades' in a new format to be tested and used before a full client release is ready.   Complaint: BROWSERS UGH THIS IS THE WORST IT MAKES A NEW WINDOW OPEN UP.   (rational thought - wait, what? I mean, seriously. This literally doesn't cost you anything. No energy, no money, no time, nothing...)   and on. and on.   Here is the deal. Riot is a developer. They have several development teams. These teams need to work together to make things happen. They also have several concurrent development cycles. These things  are  a cycle.   Writing a custom client takes time. Especially considering that MUCH of the time must be spent making a stable and solid architecture, and SECURITY. I am sure teh designers at Riot have had new desings for a new client done for MONTHS (as my experience as a web-app developer and working with design teams). Creating something in illustrator and then implementing that same stuff utilizing code takes time, even for very accomplished front-end developers. THEN, getting the thing to actually work takes very accomplished back-end developers time.   Further, consider that they are simultaniously developing the API for this so that teh data can be accessed by everyone in an intelligent way.
0	I manage an online store in Canada and it annoys the shit out of us when customers email us stating they have a promo code but it won't work. They check sites retailmenot, bargain hunter, redflag deals etc. Not only are all codes we find listed inactive but they are always widely misleading. Something like SAVE10 people wonder why they aren't getting 40% off their purchases.
0	Of course it doesn't. There's undisciplined soldiers, motherfuckers, and all sorts of scumbags in the service.   But a real opinion that wouldn't fly on reddit is that reddit is so clouded by anti-authority members that anything that says something bad about the military, the government, or law enforcement is going to skyrocket to the front on the basis of nothing more than "yeah, fuck the government and everyone who works for them".
0	I once was in a mall with my mom when I was 12 while my mom was in the bathroom, and a guy pressed up to me with something sharp into my side. He pulled me towards the exit of the store while whispering "You move you die". We were about to pass the cashier, who I think noticed something odd with the guy was next to me a bit too close, and that I was with my mom coming in. I think the guy was too busy hiding his face from the camera behind the lady at the cashiers desk, that he didn't notice me mouthing "Help me" "Help" to the cashier. I widened my eyes as we got near the exit but I heard a small siren screech noise and I bolted to the side, the guy pullig away from me and running quickly towards the doors. As he swerved to the right, and out of the metal detectors, they didn't ring, which leads me to believe that I was in no real danger at all, that the threat was a facade. I gave my statement to the police who arrived ten minutes later after we called back right after he bolted, to tell them that I wasn't being abducted, and he had escaped. I don't think they found him, but I don't really care because my first instinct to communicate with the cashier, possibly saved my life. Just sharing.
1	Well, think about it like this. I'm happy to play any role, but if I'm sent to top lane by the team, I'll lose it, and I won't have much fun playing it. In a case where other players also don't want to play that role, it's good to rely on pick order as a way of determining who will play the role. It's meant to be a determining factor after communication breaks down. Additionally, it's not "jerkiness" to have a preference and increased skill for certain roles. Pick order ensures that all players will get their choice at certain times. So, yes, I'd say communication > pick order > call order will lead highest overall enjoyment across all players without negatively impacting win rates.
0	To reiterate, there is a distinction to be made between "two-piece" and a bikini.  In my opinion, bikinis are inappropriate to put on young children because they are impractical (they expose a much larger area of skin to UV rays and often are difficult to keep in place which I have found can annoy the child).  Other two-piece bathing suits, such as tankinis, are different. They are practical because they allow for easy bathroom access while still providing more protection from the UV rays.  Still, they do not provide as much protection from the sun as the swim-shirts most little boys wear so... meh.   That being said, this season, having spent a fair amount of time looking for bathing suits for a 4 year old who constantly needs to pee, it was extremely difficult to find a bathing suit that was not a one-piece or an itty-bitty bikini without ordering from a place like LLBean. Many of the stores the private club members are apt to shop in (Gap, Jack & Janie, Lord & Taylor, etc.) only carried one or two tankinis while offering a much larger selection of one pieces and bikinis.  It is possible that we were late to buy them and all the other tankinis had been bought,  but it seems unlikely.  However, I did noticed that the store Justice, which markets to girls 7-12 (I think) had significantly more covering two pieces than the stores that carried toddler sizes.
1	Part of riots problem with it is that its much harder to get angry with someone who you see as a real person (because you are talking to them), so people in voice chat who are toxic focus on the rest of the people is the game.  So rather than one dick you can get 3-4 people turned against one person by the toxic player.  I have been in chats with several toxic players and none of them have said anything bad to me while saying awful things about others.
1	his early game was always a bit tricky vs high mobility people, but what really hurts him early is that the 1000 g augement is much, much less efficient than it was before.  Don't get me wrong, I actually like him more now and I think he's quite a bit better mid to late game, but you can't get that huge 100 ap powerspike and come to lane with 250 ap 14 minutes into the game.  Laser waveclear doesn't pick up until later.  His q is where it's at for laning now though.  The auto attack comes out super fast and he got a range buff on q cast.  Plus shield is instant.  I've been putting 2 or three points into it during laning and it feels pretty strong.  Late game aoe just destroys all.
0	Similar, when I was a freshman in college I started dating a girl later in the year. I thought she was nice, but it turned out that she was a boring person, never wanted to go out, and only wanted to spend time in her room. I was bored with this but never did anything about it...until her best friend met us out on a rare occasion when we had a date.   The friend (who initially introduced us) started to stare at me from across the table at Starbucks, and started rubbing her leg up on me under the table. I was a bit stunned but didn't want to make it obvious, as this friend was the closest "friend" of the girl I was dating.   A week later I was thinking of breaking up with this girl because I just wasn't having a fun time, and she was also suggesting names for our future kids, and having me meet her parents (this was 3 weeks into dating). This freaked me out not only because it was so early in the relationship, but because I was a freshman, and didn't necessarily want to commit myself like that. I told this to her friend and she asked me to reconsider and that she wanted to talk to me in person. I agreed and went over to her dining hall to talk with her.   After talking, she invited me back and then jumped on me when we went into the dorm. She led me up to her room and gave me one wild night. After that, she felt bad, and probably agreed with me that it would be best to break up with her. I agreed and then broke the bad news the next day. Her and I rarely talked again, as I didn't want to rekindle hope in her and I never wanted her to find out what had happened. The other friend and I stayed in contact for a while but we rarely talk now.
1	I'll say this, I dodge very rarely and it is always a direct result of a team that somehow, be it through people intentionally choosing already filled roles, or last picks not paying attention/poor communication not picking something and insta locking.  Sometimes the team comp you wind up with on your team is just so so so bad (3 ap carries, no tank) it is less painful to just take the dodge.   I'm all for trying new things, but sometimes it's just gonna be too painful.  Also, if someone is a raging jerk in character select, and refusing to work with the team in champ select, I assume they won't communicate well in game either, if I just don't feel like I can handle them all game, I'll dodge then too.   That being said, I prolly only dodge 1 in 20 games.
0	I remember in 8th grade I was I'm my Woodshop history class (well it was an American history class taught by a woodshop instructor.) There was this girl named well her last name was peck. Anyway, I she say next to me in that class and we never really had a meaningful conversation. So one day I was highlighting in my book and I suck at highlighting, So peck takes notice to this and just yanks my highlight and book away from me kinda doing her best to rub as much as she could on me. She talks me "I can't stand the way you highlight, ill just do it for you. " This surprised me.   Weeks later I'm sitting talking to a friend in the class and peck and her friend (an ugly duckling turned into a butter faced swan in high school.) Snuck up on us and kissed us on the cheek. Peck kissed my cheek and her friend kissed my friend on the cheek. Me being a retard took a moment to be funny yelling, "she pecked me! She pecked me!" Then grabbing sand paper then start sanding my cheek off. When I realized I was scratching the skin off I realized I took this joke too far. Years pass and after high school my friends tell me peck had a thing for me. She turned out to become really sexy, but also a ho from what I heard. So, I just felt like sharing the story.
1	I think what people do not get is how toxicity works and how it comes about.   This whole comment is only tackling the problem of people defending unconventional picks with strangers as something that is not toxic at all.   First off, i would like to say that we have all been thinking very selfishly in term of Player Toxicity. Many of us tend to feel that others are toxic in their speech/actions towards us when we do not"deserve"it. An example would be doing unconventional stuff with random strangers in a team.   People all tend to defend this as"Everyone is a beginner once etc"and do not see the problem nor see this as being toxic in the first place.This is where i would like to tackle the problem.Doing something unconventional with people you do not know when you are supposed to IS toxic.   Why is it toxic?   Think of your team as your family.  Imagine they ask you not to go to the casino,but you still want to go. You would probably defend it with something like"Its fun,I will win etc"when you know that the chances of you losing money is really high. Yea,its fun for you,but your family have to tolerate with you anyhow spending money and making you upset,and this is already with people you know. Its toxic to the family but you would think that it is not toxic to you as it does not really affect you directly. Why would they not have the reason to leave you,ban you from the casino,take actions against you? Heck they even have reasons to verbally abuse you,its what most families would think is okay since the fault is with the person who likes to go to the casino and lose alot of hard earned money.   The only exception i could say is those people who have planned out their casino trip,knows what to do to win AND actually bring home money won or drawing even with what they have brought to the casino.Those type of people are those whose families can trust with the money they bring to the casino.
1	This honestly goes to show how stupid and forgiving the Ranked system was. I'm not talking about the reset or the placement games at all. There was about double to triple the amount of people in diamond and platinum. People seem to forget that games are almost entirely based on HIDDEN MMR, which means you CANT SEE IT. The ranked system is just a really nice packaging of the ranked system to make you feel better about yourself in my opinion. I honestly miss Elo, and don't know why people NEEDED the system to be changed to this, Elo was a very accurate representation of progress or no progress within the ranked system, now I feel like people have to guess what their rank really is.   With all these placement games and complaining.     Who cares... If you were gold 4 and now you are Silver 2, well guess what, you were a gold 4 player not long ago, what is stopping you from getting back there?     If you were Gold 5 and 0LP and constantly losing and now after the reset you are Silver 5, well that makes sense, you clearly didn't belong in your Division. Riot was holding your hand.

FITS WELL INTO MOST TEAM COMPOSITIONS, DEALS GOOD MIX OF DAMAGE AND OFFERS LOTS OF MOBILITY. VERSATILE TO A FAULT, OFTEN FAILS TO BALANCE OUT EXTREMELY LOPSIDED TEAMCOMPS. FOOD FOR ALLIGATOR.   COWARD TRAITOR BROTHER PLAYS MOST LIKE BRAVE ALLIGATOR, ONLY SLOWER AND FATTER. PATHETIC FARMING OF Q OFFERS LATE GAME UTILITY AND DAMAGE REGARDLESS OF ITEMS, BUT ADMIRABLE FARMING POTENTIAL. DUE TO LACK OF ESCAPE TOOLS AND EXTREME SUSTAIN, MORE MENTALLY CHALLENGING THAN IRELIA, SINCE MISTAKES ARE UNFORGIVING, BUT LESS MECHANICALLY CHALLENGING THAN IRELIA, SINCE ABILITIES ARE EASIER TO USE. MORE SIMILAR TO BUTCHER OF THE SANDS, DESPITE BEING COWARD TRAITOR. ALSO FOOD FOR ALLIGATOR.
0	I'm guessing you live in the US. This is one expensive reason parents should educate their children about drinking and by educate I mean  teach them about alcohol and how to handle it  not  wait until you're 21 . It's my belief that alcohol is worse than sex for misinformation given to teens because everyone thinks they're too young to learn. So they get their information from their friends and older siblings when really it should be a whole series of lessons. /soapbox

1	Winning a game is easy, but you cannot rely on Solo Queue to carry you. You need to carry your team to win a game, true you cannot always carry cos eventually you will run into a team who plays better than yours.   I play Caitlyn ADC and i can pretty much carry any game unless the team uber feeds or i have a bad laning phase which i can do at times cos im not the best and there is always players who are better.   Over 30 games i lost 6, 3 of those were down to afker from start the other 3 were down to me having a bad lane or a bad support.   I was always on a 5:1 KD ratio in all games finishing some games with 20+ kills.   If you have a bad laning phase you need to spend the midgame farming everything, a well fed/farmed champion can carry any game.. but if you arent farming or killing then you will fall behind and struggle.
0	TIL: My experience angers people so much they downvote when I share what has happened to me.
1	I think the balanced part of the game is at level 30 when everyone has access to everything.  There isn't competitive league of legends at sub-level-30.  Sure, new players coming into the game don't have access to everything, but I don't see a problem in that.  Do you think this has affected the amount of players playing this game?  It might, but it would only affect a small percentage of the people starting to play this game.  I think more people would be affected by everyone else who plays this game than the fact that I can only pick ghost cleanse right now and you can pick ignite exhaust.
0	For what it's worth, those of us who might die soon have pretty awesome conversations:  we tend to not let little things bother us, we tend to talk about things that matter (we don't have time to waste on things that don't), and we tend to listen well, because we are very aware that relationships are among the few really important things in life.   A harsh truth of life is that if you care about others, you  will  go through the pain of losing someone you care about/are attached to.   The joy in life is that you got a chance to know and care about them.   This was put very succinctly by a nurse of mine when I asked her how she can keep coming in to work and caring for people when so many of them die.  She said:   "I do everything I can to care for all of you during the time that I know you, and I am blessed by the chance to be a part of your lives."   (chemo nurses kick ass)

1	At level 1 he has his Q with about a 14 second cool down. He uses it on you once you now have lane control. He is basically 1-5 a one trick pony only being able to keep lane control using his bombs. His bombs at level 1 cost 70 mana, his level 2 skill is about 50 so at level 3 to effectively hurt you he is bursting about 190 mana, this is basicalll 80% of his mana. He then can't do anything for 12 seconds (no skills) and then about 2 minutes (regen mana). If he gets a bomb on you, make him regret it. He's a one trick pony and as soon as a bomb hits you he can't do anything else but some awful 30 damage auto attack. You take a shovel and beat the crap out of that pony.   Urgot, Ashe, Malz, Cait, Corki, Vlad, Morde, MF, Sona, Soraka, Cho, GP ... etc etc etc all out lane him as he has to wait so long between skills. Your issue is not your champ it's your game play. You are not assessing the situation correctly. You clearly have the wrong mind set. You need to learn his strengths and weaknesses then use them against him. Learn your champs, learn your maximum out/in put.
0	Except for in your magic land if we don't get "1 for 1", which would be terrible terrible business, it doesn't matter.   Perhaps you've never heard of the concept of diminishing marginal returns that I referenced in my first post, so let me enlighten you: it means that for each additional unit of input less and less is produced - it doesn't mean that each additional input will produce less than one unit of output. It means it will produce an ever diminishing amount of output. So 3 inputs might produce 6 ouptut, 4 inputs might produce 7.5 outputs, and 5 inputs might produce 8 outputs. The point isn't the total amount of outputs, it's that the total is increasing at a decreasing rate.
1	I was a good Vi player in S3. Now I'm main support.  Despite this I do play jungle every now and then. Vi is damn good if built correctly. How? I'm not sure yet.  What I do know is that you should start with W if you know the leash isn't going to be great. Otherwise, go for E.  Some players say that maxing W is best because of the ATT Speed but TBH it's not game changing. Maxing E is not that great either. However lowering Q's CD is indeed amazing! I would maximize my Q first, then W and end with E (of course you do max R whenever it's available). As for the items it's very situational. Maybe you will call me a noob but I would like to build BOTRK and Spirit of the Elder Lizard. Then I would either get Sunfire+Warmog and some MR or go for a Black Cleaver + Warmog (if they don't have BORK, else get Sunfire or Randuin's Omen) and GA/BV.
1	In solo queue anything and everything CAN work. However as players get better and more knowledgeable the chances of success with certain strategies just end up falling flat. Now in terms of what happens when people double jungle vs a standard composition, you ultimately leave your bot lane adc alone in a 1v2 and he will be punished to the extent of the enemy skill level. It would be very unlikely that he would be anywhere near as strong coming out of that lane. The other problem that you'll run into is that while double jungling you have two junglers splitting gold vs the enemy jungler who has to share with no one. Now it's not entirely the case because as the jungle 2v1 you can pressure the enemy jungler off farm and split between the two of you, but the end result minimally different power levels between you and the enemy assuming you've played it super well and not allowed him any farm or any dive of the already 2v1 lane. Then teamfights happen. and you've got two slightly stronger jungler/supports with 2 on par laners and one weaker laner vs two weaker jungler/supports with 2 par laners and one stronger laner. Might not sound so terrible but then you have to consider that the 1 true support functions at pretty much the same effectiveness in a fight with or without the gold and likely has multiple skills that either punish you for trying to get close to his/her team, or alternatively has powerful engage tools that can lockdown whichever part of your team he/she pleases.
0	Please report the dog to the police/animal control.  I've been in a similar situation.  My dog who isn't all that small was attacked by an animal of similar size when we went out walking one night.   The attacking dog broke loose from its owner after seeing my dog and just went right into attack mode.  I had to physically remove the attacking dog to get it to let go of my dog, and then lead my dog away. I was in pure protect mode and probably could have easily been bitten.   The owner was very apologetic and offered to pay for the vet bills and everything.  My dog had a few puncture wounds from the dog's bites.  The Vet urged me to make the call to the police to make sure that the attack was on record.   Turns out the owner had several other dogs removed from his home and euthanized for attacking other dogs and people.  He was forbidden by the city to have any more dogs in the city and was arrested the next day.
1	Inb4 Mordekaiser rage and downvotes buuuuut....   Mordekaiser is a champion that will never be a strong, viable pick unless he is OP. Any champ with a low skill ceiling (Garen comes to mind) is this way. As soon as you make them strong enough to go toe to toe with the other strong picks, they are instantly used to their full potential and therefore too strong. Most champs are balanced with some room for error built in, but there is really no way to screw up while playing Morde/Garen, so they have a tendency to become overpowered.   This is why they are both either OP or UP.  First you see both of them every game, then they were both nerfed in the same patch. Everyone cried so they reverted the nerfs... BOOM they were OP again. This is why they are trying to make newer champs have a higher skill ceiling, even if they have a low skill floor.
1	I think his wither and spirit fire are actually very good in terms of utility.   His wither is comparable to exhaust, and with 40% CDR, is on a 6.6 second cooldown for a 5 second spell, so it has about 75% uptime. In addition, it has 700 range, meaning it cast be cast relatively safely.   Spirit fire provides an near instant AOE 40 armor shred at 650 range. As a comparison, Aegis'/Bulwark's Aura is 10armor. I can't think of any other skill that I would prefer for resistance shredding purposes. Taric's Shatter is a 30 armor shred, but forces him to be next to his targets to shred them. Nidalee's shred is percentage based (up to 40%), and thus is better against targets with over 100 armor. However, there is a delay between placing the trap and the actual shred taking place, in addition to the AOE being smaller.   If we are assuming a 0 cs support, his Q would be relatively useless given no stacks and less tankyness. I don't believe his ultimate wouldn't be too great either, as it requires him to be next to enemies for the maximum effect, and again, a support Nasus would probably be somewhat squishy.
1	I can't possibly cover all the reasons but here are some of the main ones...     In the early days Monte cried for professionalism and perfect player behavior while [taking pot shots at players]( after getting some negative comments on reddit and his blog. He could dish it out but not take the heat. To his credit he eventually realized that the eSports infrastructure chasm in NA necessitates teams and players to conduct themselves differently from his then lofty goals. Yet when he did that people considered him a sell out. He just can't win.     Rightly or wrongly other people feel he is an opportunist who is at least partially responsible for the collapse of LoL at MLG thus harming the NA region. The argument goes that after selling MLG a bill of goods whereby GGChronicle staff would provide the talent needed to cast LoL (until Dota2 was ready for prime time,) he left them in the lurch as soon as he got a better offer from OGN. Objective measurements of stream ratings for MLG's LoL segments and MLG's direction on LoL seem to correlate well with these assertions.     Finally and probably most importantly there are several professional casters (including those at Riot) who believe he is a mediocre caster who simply has an easy region and ample production support to cushion his faults. He's been brought in to provide depth to the analysis desk, but he would potentially be toxic if given a bigger stage.
0	I think it's a great idea. After my last major breakup, I was in a borderline depressed state for months until I got my first dog. Although I do recommend adopting one that's at least a year or two old, possibly older. That way you're past the shit all over the house phase and more likely past the destroy all your shoes/furniture phase. Dogs are definitely a responsibility and in many aspects resemble having a human child, so get any big traveling out of the way first.
1	I'm only a silver player, but I have some advice that should help.   One of the most frustrating things about starting LoL was learning about champions/skills/items/etc.  I had the luxury of starting the game when it was semi-young and didn't have to deal with over 100 different champions right off the bat.  I noticed once I started playing other champions at least three or four times I got a better idea of what their strengths and weaknesses were.  So during free weeks try new champions you have never played before, even if it's just co-op vs AI and learn those strengths/weaknesses.   Solomid.net is a great place for champion guides so when starting a new champion take a look at their featured and approved guides for, well, guidance. NEVER blindly build what the guide says.  If it says get a randuins omen and the enemy is mostly magic damage you're better off getting a Runic bulwark/banshee veil/spirit visage/etc.  Knowing what to build and when is something that comes with a lot of games played and is in my opinion what really sperates great players from good players; the ability to make on the fly decisions like that.   Also, getting kills is fun, but remember this is a game of gaining objectives and ultimately destroying the enemy nexus.  Work to get objectives and gain a lead, that will work toward kills in the long run and bring you closer to victory.   I would add more, but am doing this all by cellphone so sorry for any formatting/grammatical errors.

1	It takes time and experience to fully comprehend the game. I'd get at least 300-400 normal wins before playing ranked. Don't ever get cocky or rage, remain calm and focused while at the same time having fun with it. Don't expect anything, expect everything. Knowing when to push, when to harass, how to farm, when to engage, how to zone, ward, freeze, etc. will all come in time. You've gotta do your research, know all champs, watch games, guides, plays. Play to be a better player, not a higher ranked one. In higher ranks you'll need your muscle memory to kick in as well as your swift decision making. Like I said, it will take time.
0	You practice but don't play in games. So if you were there to e a line backer and weren't as big as they needed you to be you could red shirt and lift while practicing with the team so when you did play you could be an asset. But you only get one year for red shirting. So you have to choose whether you will and when. There is also medical red shirting which is just what it sounds like if you have a medical reason you can appeal for an additional redshirt year because you are only eligible for 4 years + 1 redshirt year.       Then there is grey shirting where you aren't technically a full time student to get past the eligibility restrictions. You take 1- the amount to be full time and you get a free year to train with the team! Usually happens at the junior college level.
0	I think people should be free to live how they want, yet i dont think people should tailor the world around them. If they want to eat and be fat, as long as they are happy, good for them.   If you want to sit at home all day and play video games, and die at an early age, if it makes you happy, do it. Fuck the people who say you should get out more. Its not their life. As long as you arnt hurting people or breaking laws, Enjoy life how ever you want.   Dont let people guilt you into doing shit you dont want to do. People who tell you, "Get out more! Go Travel! Go to a bar! Go skydiving!" are telling you that, because that's what they like to do. Don't do something because they like to do it, because its not their life. The bottom line is, its your fucking life, you live it how you want. If you go your entire life never seeing the Grand Canyon or the Mona Lisa, who gives a fuck, as long as those weren't on your bucket list.   But on a side note, if you chose to sit at home, eating KFC and playing world of Warcraft every day, and you gain 500 pounds, don't get pissed when you get turned down, or have to pay for two seats on an airplane. You aren't handicapped. You shouldn't be afforded any special treatment because you chose a different lifestyle.
1	For me, personally, I try to see it as a challenge.  I try to do the best I can to work on anything that might need improving.  Map Awareness, Ward control, making the correct decision.   I know that it feels hopeless and "what's the point". but as soon as i have an afk'er i try to take the opportunity to at least improve something about my game.   I'll usually just try to focus on one thing that i want improved.  If it's Map awareness I'll try to make a rule to look at the minimap after every CS i make and take a mental snapshot of what i saw.

Orianna lvl16+ 300dmg (+ 70% AP), Gankplank lvl 16+ 165dmg (+ 20% AP) and such...   The strongest AoE ult in the game just based on its base value is Brand or Fiddlestricks ult , but there are other things that should be considered: ult as melee vs ult as a ranged champ, role on the team, items etc.   Staying at max range I would consider Brands or Viktors ult very strong. If you want to dive and use Zonya's no doubt Fiddle is the way to go.
1	Things I did not expect to happen in 2011: replay functionality, spectator functionality, and a client that doesn't suck monkey nuts.   Things that happened in 2011: Spectator functionality, sort of.   Dominion did also come out of left field, and even though I think it's boring I'll give credit there - I guess that was pretty unexpected. So in terms of expecting the unexpected, not too shabby. I just think it's important to differentiate 'expecting the unexpected' from, well, real progress. Riot making the home screen a picture of goatse would also have been unexpected, but that doesn't mean anything.   I still think it's a complete joke that two years after release, there is zero sign of replay functionality. And don't give me that horse crap about patches breaking replays either, HoN has that same problem and yet I was able to watch a replay from beta (BETA!) just the other day. And seriously, the Adobe Air client is awful. It has been forever. It needs to go.
1	Who you choose to play shpuld be more who you like to play. But a higher kda may show that you are better with some champs. But some champs naturally gets higher kda than others. E.g . leblanc and akali who are single target assasin type champs focus on killing one target and with these you can do really good but get relatively low kda as oppose to supports like soraka who can heal a her teammates and get a lot of assist.
1	I feel for ya man. I was afraid of this after reading Riots plan. I dont plan on playing ranked with this system as it promotes stagnation in my opinion. Also how does the idea of a best of 2/3 and 3/5 fit in a team based game  where you're partnered with random people . I could see 2/3 and 3/5 in ranked 3s and 5s because it makes it feel like a challenge with your team to get higher. In solo queue though, it feels like a random mechanic that they thought would be cool on paper. The system really only works for those that can play a ton of ranked every day/week. Otherwise its very hard to maintain the win rate required to advance consistently.
1	This post tells me 2 things. 1 You said your a CLG fan to cover the fact your a TSM fan and don't want to feel like your just another fanboy who thinks he's entitled to an opinion no one cares about. 2 You have no clue how English humour works and find summoner insight offensive because what is said is funny, straight to the point and doesn't hold back anything. Du du duhh!!
0	As a student of many classes and two states, I must say, PROJECTORS and CHEAP TRANSPARENT SHEETS. They are VERY cheap, most any school can afford them, while having 50+ very large monitors setting in the library, ready to be used by any of the teachers at any time, and to be used for educational videos, for the class.. In Michigan, we just used white-boards and markers, WORKED FINE. In Michigan and quite a bit through school in NC, we simply used projectors!
1	I think you have to consider that there's so many more variables within this than you're accounting for.   There's many reasons why people rage in solo queue but 2 of the biggest reasons for this is:     embarrassment   frustration   Insecurity/ feeling of powerlessness   nurture from other toxic players     Embarrassment: If you're Japanese you know how 真面目some people are and not all people will be the same toxic people that you've seen before. When people are playing on the NA server, most American people on the web have no 建前 and they talk too much when they're frustrated. If there's a localized Japanese server who knows if people will talk with more hesitation.   Frustration: Everyone has felt frustration playing this game before because it's honestly a game that is fun but hard to master. Since most of the Japanese people playing are mostly new to the game because DOTA was not that popular in Japan when it was popular in the world. This is probably a new voyage for them and a lot of them will be frustrated after seeing just how big of a gap there is to catch up to. This will change over time when people get more comfortable and they start to catch up.   Insecurity/ feeling of powerlessness: If you're playing on 150 ping compared to 5-80 American ping, it'll get to you mentally if even if the ping actually doesn't make that much of a difference. And like you said a lot of Japanese people don't feel secure about their english because they cant speak it that well. "英語上手く話せないし、馬鹿にされたらどうしよう。。。” A lot of this will change when people get a japanese server.   Nurture from toxic players: You might not have been around when League didn't have a tribunal,  but league was pretty bad when it came to toxicity. My very first game of league(right before season 1), people from my team AND the enemy team both told me to kill myself because I died 2-3 on my very first game of league , and I'm not even lying. Even when I came back to the game after 2 months because my friends were playing, the biggest thing that prevented me from prevented me from playing this game a lot was the people who constantly told me to go kill myself or calling me bad an honestly that has cleaned up A LOT over the years but it still lingers to this day in league because toxic comments like that are contagious. I'm pretty sure the Japanese players playing for the first time got abused similarly when they were playing but RIOT has a LOT of experience dealing with toxic players.
1	The thing is we have zero context about the 'examples' either.   'gg' could have been after they got aced and were getting the nexus pushed, or it could have been in champ select after they didn't ban Blitzcrank. We don't know and OP didn't bother to provide context.   He also didn't include people that responded, to the so called toxic comments when respondents are more often than not far more toxic to the game by not just ignoring someone else's frustration.   Stating "top lost mid lost bot lost" is the same to me as them saying "they have 4 dragons", "Jax is fed", and a myriad of other status updates so that you can actually form a strategy. But OP leaves out if that was followed up with "so we cant fight them guys just try and farm up and pick them off with vision control".   Just because someone might take something as toxic when it isn't intended is their own problem and they should learn to work with others rather than getting offended at the earliest possible moment. It isn't my job to babysit emotionally unstable people and get them to work together and I'm not going to make it. This behavior is far more toxic to LoL games than any negative comment. These people WANT to be offended or they would just /muteall and play the game instead of responding in kind.   And seriously 'ff@20' is not toxic. It is shorthand for 'I want to surrender'.   I'm way more toxic than any of the examples OP used, but I just don't send anything or I say it out loud. I'm well aware of how these can be considered toxic, but you cannot argue that "this Riven is literally fucking retarded and blind probably couldn't even kill herself if she tried" and "I want to surrender" are equally toxic. One steps outside of the game to insult the person directly and the other is literally just a strategy suggestion. One with 0% chance of winning the game, but it is a strategy.
1	He emphasizes everything wrong with CertainlyBoopity's design patterns, starting with his entire theme: dark, edgy, lone samurai. Yasuo is the epitome of "designed for straight males." His kit then gives him all the tools to be a complete douche from the start of the game until the Nexus explodes:   0 cool down dashes that make it so he gets to chase you or "juke" you as long as he wants; a shield that charges up as he's doing this; the "double crit" passive that breaks item choices for him and turns him into a monster if he gets the slightest lead; then there's the fact that he's a melee carry with the hardest CC in the game, knockups. Yasuo was built from scratch to emphasize the entire CoD fantasy: doing shit loads of damage with high mobility and little to no counterplay (i.e. Being the hero). And I haven't even gotten into his wall.   Aside from his kit, there's the people who play him. I know I shouldn't generalize a champion's playerbase, but fuck it, I'm already biased against Yasuo and all of CertainlyBoopity's monstrosities; I haven't seen a juvenile playerbase as immature as Yasuo's since Tryndamere was popular. I bet if you were to count the number of all chat messages sent by champion, Yasuo would be in the top 5. He's a champion that makes you feel like you're outplaying an opponent (sort of like release Vayne and Nocturne) even though you're just playing a broken champion.
1	Thanks for the
0	OP, my wonderful pair of aunties has been together almost 44 years. They came out together in the summer of 69 and both have very conservative parents. Things weren't great for them but eventually their family accepted it. Long story short, 44 years later they are happier than ever. Knowing and loving them as a pair since I was born has been one of THE main factors in my acceptance of homosexuality. Your grandfather is a dick, but his overreaction may actually benefit you in an odd way. Your mom and dad might be more accepting to buffer the pain your grandfather has just caused you. I hopebthe best for you.
1	I think the best thing to do here would to give chogath a small movespeed buff after landing feral or Q. I mean interrupting seems fine to me because the nature of the skills not any others in the game like it. Giving him a small move speed buff after landing his Q or W would allow him to follow up and or give him a chance to get out of sticky situations.   In the case of just making them not interrupt movement all he would lose is mana instead of sacrificing some mobility for the time being. It would allow him to just throw Q to try to escape or W without repercussion.
0	I personally don't see how their beer would taste better just because of how politically correct and "morally righteous" the company decides to look for the sake of marketing
0	Y'know, considering that this causes a commontion for all the other people trying to dine in peace, causes bad feelings on the part of the parents, and is petty revenge against a child who does not know any better... This is actually a really asshole thing to do.   It may feel nice to win a small victory by irritating a child, but you have to consider the ramifications of your actions. Obviously the parents aren't going to properly address the situation, or they wouldn't have a brat in the first place. There's no real gain, and you actually have a lot of negative impacts if you do this.
1	Agree with the first, but the second not so much. If flash and/or ignite were available from level 1  and say cleanse was unlocked at level 12, then I highly doubt there would be any incentive for new players to try out any of the other spells. By the time they are level 12 they would have figured out flash is the best summoner spell making the other ones pointless.
1	No more outrunning Irelia as AD carry.  Queen of toplane again.
1	I think playing a wide variety of roles for a balanced amount of time helps your map awareness. At a low-mid level of play a lot of the time top lane won't give two shits what's happening bottom lane and vice versa, to the point where they have no clue the enemy jungler is currently in the bottom lane brush whilst he thinks he's about to get ganked. Of course it matters for everything from positioning of the enemy jungler team to timing of buffs, strength of champions, what to build as a result of this etc.   Swapping constantly between roles without confining yourself to one or two gives you a bigger insight into what's important for the macro part of the game and what the team needs to do to win, with map awareness being a huge part of this.
0	I just don't even know where to start with this ...   IMO:   The dude is a mess. Stop banging him until he gets his shit straight.   FWB do not buy each other dinner. They do not do anything coupley or romantic ... It's friends ... with benefits. Not Friends with "I'm not sure I'm ready to date you so I'll bang you while I figure it out" ... Or "I'm working through personal issues and you're throwing your pussy at me so I'll sporadically take it on random nights."
0	It really depends on where you go for Driver's Ed. I grew up in MA and took classes in my hometown, a friend took classes one town over. My classes consisted of going over everything to do with driving a car, including some basic maintenance (weather didn't permit doing demonstration/practice of tire changing), and we watched maybe one video. Our instructor gave us tests and even made us write an essay. I felt like I was in driving college- but I am an excellent and knowledgeable driver because of it.   My friends class watched drivers ed movies every class. I didn't even know there were enough videos to do that. It was a fucking joke, but it counted as drivers ed. She barely learned how to drive. One day we were waiting to turn left at an intersection, she was driving, and we were at a red arrow. She turned to me and said "That arrow means I can go, right?". After I explained that "No, you fucking CAN NOT go!" she told me that she had done it several times already.
0	This sounds like my company.  They sent out a survey asking why the employees thought all of our top engineers were leaving for other jobs.  This survey was anonymous, and the overwhelming majority of the responses were because we have shit upper management who were 10 years behind the times and had to vision.  The next survey we got dealt with an assessment of our managers.  This time it had a place to put your name.  This was on a Wednesday.  On Thursday, two mid-level managers were fired for what we later found out were extremely harsh, honest responses about upper managements lack of direction and vision.  No one fills out surveys anymore after that.
1	You are playing with plats while you are D5? You should be playing with higher diamonds. That is why you are gaining less lp and losing lots. Somehow you dropped over 100 MMR (lolking score) in 1 day and about 80 the few days before that. You are recovering from that right now. It is odd that it is taking so long to establish your MMR again but since you dropped so significantly so fast, that might be the cause.
0	Guys when they start approaching women have to realise two things and once they get that in their head, they will be fine for the rest of their lives:   When you pick mint and chocolate ice cream over vanilla ice cream. The vanilla ice cream is not butt hurt about it.   Not everyone is buying what you are selling, but if you don't sell it, no one can buy it.   Here comes the explanation:   When someone picks mint ice cream, this doesn't make vanilla ice cream taste any worse than it did previously, it doesn't make vanilla ice cream any less valuable and doesn't make it's existence pointless. Vanilla ice cream doesn't keep thinking about it afterwards.   Same goes with women, when a woman says i'm not interested. This does not lower your value as a person. You should have confidence to know you are worth it, if that particular person isn't interested, just think well seems I wasn't the flavor she likes and move on. It shouldn't cause you pain because it didn't "remove" anything from you and doesn't invalidate you in any way.   For the second principle, it comes from the psychology of sales. Essentially, if you do not try to sell your product, your chances of selling it is 0% (unless faith has someone come along and make you an offer you can't refuse). Any attempt on your part to sell a product nets you the same chance as if you are not + a little something based on your experience and unique product offering.
0	I hate that " her vag will be like throwing a hot dog down a hall way bla blabla" crap I have three kids, and almost half way done with my fourth with my husband and my yoo hoo is still as magically tight as ever, which is probably why we have so many kids. In some cases post birth lady bodies will enjoy sex even more then they did before.
0	From a biological perspective; the sperm of teen males can fertilise eggs as effectively as an adults. A teen female however would face various health problems by becoming pregnant, both for herself and her child. Problems such as high blood pressure, a greater risk of preeclampsia, premature birth and low birth weight.   Obviously (assuming the sex was between two consenting teens) they should both share the blame for the risks they impose upon their baby. But a teen dad could have a baby with an adult female without any increase in health risks, whereas a role reversal can lead to health problems.
1	Can people stop the  some champs  are OP just because they're fotm. Most champs in the game are viable if played right/ not shut down correctly. A friend of mine play annie top and he never loses lane with it. Do you see anyone saying annie top OP?
1	I like the concept of mini-games in LoL, but I have a bad feeling about this for a few reasons:     The lack of IP Sinks  Recently the lack of IP outlets has been discussed on reddit, its a minority issue but this is something which would make the problem worse.     Slightly Devalues IP Boosts  People get IP boosts a lot of the time to save up for runes, giving people another way to get runes will give people less reason to buy IP boosts and therefore less reason to buy RP, which hurts Riots cash flow.     Less IP Spent on runes means more IP spent on champions  Runes are a big spending point for IP,but if there is another way to get runes then people will use it for champions, again this is something which hurts Riots cash flow.       These are a few reasons why I think riot wouldn't implement the idea in its current form.   However  it does tie into an idea I had recently concerning the addition on several  LoL-themed minigames . Suppose there was an Arcade built into the client, some really simple games that you can play at the cost of IP (Something like 50IP a go). These could be played during Login Queues, Matchmaking Queues etc. There could be ladders tied to Your league and Server for high scores etc, and you could win prizes (like Runes, more IP or Arcade-exclusive skins). It gives Riot another way to drive people to get IP Boosts (Could be profitable for them if done correctly), gives people something to do during queues and provides that "i've bought everything already" minority with another IP sink.
1	Elo hell really doesn't exist. It's an excuse for people to blame others rather than look at their own mistakes and try to improve. While it's true that some matches are unwinable, most matches should be winable and usually are. People tend to overlook that, to get to platinum they have to be a part of the top .3% which is only available to a few of the best. People overlook that even getting gold is quite the achievement cause it means you've played better than 97% of the entire community. That said, Wickd gets to platinum easy because he has the experience of someone who plays at platinum and knows exactly what calls to make, when to make them and all that. If you have never been to 2.3k before, you don't know what to expect, how people play and all that. The only thing you can do is adapt. Adapting and practice are the only way to get forward and with anything it'll be a long and hard ''quest''. In season 1, most of the pros had like 2k matches played in ranked. That's not even taking into account all the normal games they have played. Statistically (and realistically) you will raise in Elo if you consistantly play better than your current Elo. Everyone has a DC or a troll or someone who's plain bad once in a while but think about the times it happened to the enemy team. You've had free-wins in your entire ranked career.
0	First of all, relax.  The world is not anymore fucked up than it used to be.  Sadly enough, it's always been fucked up, but it just seems like there's more happening now (when there actually isn't.) Here's why: We have more access to media.  You can now access news/resources/stories 24/7 from a variety of different sources.  You can access it everywhere from the standard news sources to blogs to personal accounts of people who were there.  We are no longer limited to television, newspapers, and magazines controlling the flow of information.  (This is a double-edged sword.)  Not that the news is more objective, but people in general who are not professional journalists tend to be less objective.  Also information competing for attention is just that.  Thus it becomes more sensationalized.  A lot of sources of information don't give you the whole story.  Some give you nothing more than a soundbyte/headline.  Its hard to sift through it all to get a full story.  Hence you have stories titled like "Cops kill 5 year old."  rather than "Cops raid drug house.  Five year old shot and killed in cross fire." (I'm making this shit up, btw.) Another reason the world seems more fucked up is that almost everyone has their own camera and microphone.  People didn't used to have cell phones with high res video cameras.  Now, anyone can record anything, post it on the internet, and make it a story.  Once again, the major news companies no longer control the flow of information.  As a matter of fact, they are struggling to find their place in a world where their information is becoming less important to the general public.  Will they go away?  No.  We will always need major news sources to report things that most people don't have easy access to (such as NATO peace talks, wars, etc.)  But for more local stories, anyone with a smart phone can be a "journalist."  I'm probably generalizing a lot of this and missing a bunch of information.  It's also 5:40 in the morning and I'm getting ready for work.  So let me know if I missed anything.
0	Go fuck yourself!!!!   How about because no one understands/no one notices Body Language!   We live in a world where everything has the same attention span as a 30 video of a cat falling over... body language too
0	I did the EXACT same thing today... Our cats had been hanging out in our upstairs that's in a somewhat stalled renovation at the moment. Anyways, they got the idea to start using the new tub that's sitting up there as a  litter box. Neither myself nor my girlfriend are up there frequently but I was today while I was looking for some tools. I spotted the mess in the tub and in between cussing and scooping it out it noticed a puddle of drying cat urine in the bottom. Actually, I shouldn't say noticed - The smell was out of this world and there was a fair bit of it, I have a pretty strong stomach but it sent me gagging instantly. In the middle of this I decide to pour bleach into the tub to kill that nasty funk that was coming out of it (partially wrapped in shipping plastic with just one end torn open originally). I knew right away that I fucked up.... It started to bubble and fizz, kicking off waves of gas. Instantly my eyes were tearing and I was hacking up a storm. I grabbed a quick breath and held it, ran over to the windows and quickly cranked them open, turned and ran downstairs.   I'd bet it took me half an hour to come back fully around. I ended up taking a 5 gallon pail of water up and pouring it in there to dilute it down and then let it sit for an hour with all the windows open up there, used a shop vac to suck it out of the tub and then washed it out again.
1	By "harder" they most likely meant the learning curve, which might be referring to the depth the different ways to play goes. Dota 2 has more world mechanics to learn(popular example is denying) as well as more specific attributes to learn, instead of attack damage, you get Strength, Agility and Intelligence which gives attack damage depending on the main attribute of your hero.   Another way it could be perceived as harder is the way a player is punished. In LoL champions are usually able to use their spells multiple times before depletion, whereas in Dota at the lower levels you can only use your spells once or up to three times, depending on hero. This mechanic does punish those who are too eager, but it might also make the laning phase seem dull and without spells flying everywhere.   It all comes down to personal preference, of course. Both games are obviously good enough.
1	Drop your ego.   Why do we have so few ranked players? Because there are very few people that deserve it. And when someone becomes unranked, you should feel happy for them. I have a friend that's probably going to hit 50 elo soon, and he doesn't want everyone to see that. Your argument on elo invisibility can go both ways man.   You stated you want more medals, why? There are just as many reasons not to want more medals. You want everyone below 1200 elo to be classified into a few more brackets, just to have them be looked down upon by others the same as before, and then they get upset because once again new stereo-types have emerged, and now their ranks are said with spite.
0	If this is in response to the NCAA football players at Northwestern unionizing, you are not wrong. College athletes should not get paid to play and that is not what they are trying to do at Northwestern in starting their own union.   While being a college athlete is a more rigorous and demanding job than most 9 to 5's it is necessary for the athletes to maintain amateur status. If the athletes began receiving compensation they would become professionals and void their amateur status and eligibility to play for their school.   The biggest issue that is being raised with the NCAA by the Northwestern football players is the protection of the players when they are no longer able to play. If you are a player on the Northwestern football team you contribute to the millions of dollars brought in to the school by the football program. All of your dedication and sacrifice is rewarded with a free education and preferential benefits on campus (housing,  meal plans, scheduling,  etc.) yet if you suffer a career ending injury while practicing or playing for the school you risk losing your scholarship and/or being responsible for your own treatment and medical expenses if that injury turns chronic.  Once you can no longer contribute to the program, the school and NCAA washes its hands of all responsibility for anything negative resulting from your participation in a sport at their university.   I completely agree that college athletes should not be paid to play. Yet the exploitation of college athletes and the lack of accountability by their respective schools is unfair and unacceptable. IMO
0	Ready for this?   Easiest explanation (for why we STILL use it) is that it is about estimation (or fractions vs decimals).   It's not about the units in particular anymore, although they are pretty nice. Foot is about a shoe length, 1/2 a foot (6 inches) is about a hand span, 1 yard (like a meter) is about an arm length or a pace length. 100 mph is about top speed for most cars and is generally considered "really fast" by most girlfriends.  100 degrees F is "really hot outside", 0 degrees F is "really cold outside". But let's stick to distances.   I use the estimate-12-inches-by-pacing-toe-to-toe-with-shoes-on technique almost biweekly. (Ha, get it? It's funny because there are two opposing meanings to the word biweekly? No? Ok.)   It is far easier for a human to somewhat accurately estimate 1/2 or 1/4 or 1/8 visually than, say 2/5 or 7/10. (This goes for fluid measurements as well, perhaps even more so.) Into how many slices do you cut your pizza? Try feeding a hand sliced 10-slice pizza to 10 very hungry college students and see if anyone is quick to grab the biggest piece.   The foot is an arbitrary, small length. As an American, I don't really care about the exact length of the foot (and haven't met anyone who does). I'm sure someone did at some point in the past. I just care about the fact that it is divided into 12 parts.   12 is a really neat number. It has divisors 6, 4, 3, 2, and of course 12 and 1. This has handy implications far too numerous to list here. It's also sublime (look that up, it's useful, but probably too much brain-overload for this crowd I suspect). This seems like a good place to note that an Architect often deals with scales (take a look at an American architect's ruler). Having so many different divisors, it's easy to find a scale that will make your printout fit on the piece of paper.   10 is a neat number too. I'll give you that. It's easy because you have 10 digits (the flesh and bone kind) and are used to base 10. That's one of its best selling points.   (BTW, are you guys on the argue-about-the-fact-that-we-use-the-12-month-calendar-instead-of-the-10-month-calendar committee, too?)   But to set the record straight, I was taught "metric" and "standard" units side-by-side since 1st grade all the way through college, and I'm sure that is the norm. People who don't enter into sciences or engineering just stop caring about metric at some point. It's not ALL that useful (as you guys tend to tout that it is) outside of science, really, if you think about it. Or at least try to imagine living with fractions.   Any time you want to estimate? Fractions. (e.g. architecture, drawing, moving furniture, estimating vehicle sizes , etc.) Do you really need to measure a wall down to the millimeter? Is decimeter (come on, how many of you use the decimeter?) or even centimeter resolution adequate? Probably not. That's a noticeable error. It's the same argument about "why do americans still like pennies? Why don't they just get rid of the 1's unit? and upgrade to quarters only?" The thing about distances is there is no inflation. A unit is either too big or adequate. That's the whole idea behind units in the first place!!! I digress.   Any time you want to design something really precise or talk about quantum sizes? Sure. Metric. I don't need to know the fraction-of-an-inch equivalent to 1 angstrom. Nor do I care. Scientists and engineers usually care more about (measuring) really big stuff or really little stuff than the general public does. Base 10. Powers of 10. Voila. Scientific notation.   Computers? Base 2. Different ball game. I won't get into that. I will caveat that though with the fact that my license plate is 1O1O1O1. (And I've had it for years, Randall. Cops do know it, but I laugh my butt off each time they tell me nothing came back in their database search! ;)   Mechanics bolt sizes? Usually fractions. unless you can't find the right wrench, then you use the closest metric one that will fit but not strip it, or if you're working on your bike, because yeah.   Ammunition sizes? mm because they are a good good unit to compare to each other. "My gun shoots bigger bullets than your gun."   Wood beams? Fractions because of above argument   Contact lenses? mm because of relative size of the mm to eyeball standard-of-eyeball-error   Distance to Mars? who cares. not 99% of the population.   Machinist? 1000th of an inch works. So does metric.   iPhone and Android phone screen sizes? Decimal inches??? huh? Whatever.   In conclusion, I would hypothesize that Americans on average are better at computing fractions in your head than than the rest of the relevant countries in question are. Anyone want to look that up? I'm too apathetic to care much more about this topic.   I hope this puts to rest this silly argument.
1	That's not what it says. But it's pretty close.   The Graph shows how much average gold a role should be getting. Same as during the Midshotgg era of CLG they took a lot of gold from mid, Nintendude gets way less gold than should be "average." Basically what this means is, while Oddone would be getting an ancient golem and locket, Nintendude would barely finish his ancient golem.
1	It said Piglet will be benched for week 5 getting replaced by Keith it said that they had issues with the language barrier and xpecial was not happy because they had trouble communicating.
1	I am a bit late to the party, but whatever.   This prediction is based on bits and pieces of information acquired from various sources, some of the information I gathered might be wrong.   I know the least about the Asian teams so let's start with them.   I have never seen Saigon Jokers play, but based on a lot of things I have picked up on Reddit and a few other sources, I don't think they have a chance of getting out of the group stage.   World Elite has seen roster changes not too long ago. And their performance in the last few tournaments hasn't been on a level where I could see them advancing past the quarter finals.   Invictus Gaming has beaten CLG.Prime online with 200 ping and I heard they are very good. But, I've also heard that, the Chinese meta, the junglers in particular, have a very small impact on the game and they rely primarily on their carries to bring the victory home. This is the opposite to western meta, where jungle presence is key and the junglers play a vital role in a team. Based on that I can't see the Chinese meta succeeding. The western junglers are too big of a threat to allow their carries to get farmed enough to carry the games.   Taipei Assassins have been regarded as the number one team in the world, based on their performance and their training regiment. But have fallen quite a long way from that since. Their fame has been almost entirely extinguished and I just can't see them starting a huge comeback at the Season 2 finals.   Najin Sword is considered the best Korean team by quite a few people, despite being behind Azubu Frost in circuit ranks. The reason for that is their flexibility, which Frost has not been able to show until now. Nhat Nguyen said a very interesting thing on SotL: Azubu Frost has only participated in Korean tournaments, which take place over the course of weeks with a lot of preparation time between matches, and they always know who to prepare for. This is an entirely different concept than the majority of the western tournaments have. You have to play a lot of consecutive matches in one day, against a variety of different teams. And I don't know if Frost has the flexibility to handle this situation, because up until now, they didn't have to.   CLG.Primes tournament performance in Season 2 was not the best they hoped it to be. They have struggled against Korean teams and seemingly didn't improve during their time there, because despite all the training, they are still second to TSM in their region. They have also struggled against Dignitas at the S2 NA Regionals, with one of the longest games in Season 2 LANs, suffering a 0:2 defeat. TSM then proceeded to obliterate Dignitas in the finals. CLG.Eu also has a notch above their North American counterpart and we will see if the training of these two teams will pay off in the end, based on how much they are streaming, I'm not so sure.   TSM could bring home a first place at every LAN event they attended, since they replaced TheRainMan with Dyrus, there is no doubt they are the strongest NA team. However, their showing against Azubu Blaze who failed to qualify for the finals against Najin Sword, suffering a 0:5 defeat, makes it hard to see whether or not they have prepared for the Korean and EU teams, who they themself say are ahead of the NA scene.   SK Gaming may have the most popular and prominent player in the world, but they still couldn't achieve even one victory in a LAN environent in the history of the team, with a lot of lineup changes over the course of Season 2, they seem to finally have a team that could potentially have a bigger impact at the Season 2 finaly than people are willing to give them credit for. They convincingly beat CLG.Eu at the European Regionals 2:0, which nobody expected. But then got absolutely destroyed in the finals by Moscow 5.   CLG.Eu is a very strong team, they have proven themselves against Europes best and grabbed a second place on their first attendance at the OGN Summer championships. I have not seen the matches, but from what I gather, they could have come out ahead, were it not for silly mistakes. They were ahead of Azubu Frost 2:0, but couldn't bring their A game in the rest of the matches and ultimately lost 2:3 to Frost in the finals.   Which brings us to M5. They are the clear favourites of the finals. No other team is solely responsible for quite so many tweaks and changes to the meta than this team. They alone conviced Riot to nerf champions who were regarded as weak by other teams previous to M5's showing. They took every other attending team by surprise at their debut in Kiev. With innovative counterjungling strategies and level one buffs on laning champions they have secured convincing victories accross two IEM events losing only one game to TSM. They hit a bump at Dreamhack against CLG.Eu but reclaimed their spot as the #1 EU team at ECC Poland, beating CLG.Eu in the finals despite Froggens Anivia. M5 is the team to beat at the finals and I am quite certain that they will be in the Season 2 finals come October 13th.   Based on recent tournament results and other sources: M5 > CLG.Eu > Najin Sword > SK > Azubu Frost > TSM.
0	Well if you're able to plan it out, severing the brain stem or destroying the cerebellum quickly means you won't feel anything even if you don't immediately clock out. Also means your lungs stop and you get a noticeable chemical rush in the few remaining seconds of consciousness.
0	I actually used to work on one of those suicide hotlines.  I was the only male on a team of about a dozen operators.  I have a very obviously masculine voice (people used to say I should do radio), and as a result I had more immediate hang-up callers than the rest of the team combined.   Often this was due to guys calling in just to hear a female voice to whack it to.  You would know this when 5 minutes later another call comes in, gets a female operator, and her face sours quickly.   The thing is that a lot of lonely men call these suicide hotlines just looking for a sympathetic voice.  The vast majority of callers are not suicidal.  Hell, we even had regular callers we knew by name who just wanted to talk about their day.  A couple of the girls used to work on sex hotlines, and they said it was exactly the same on the hotlines - the majority of their time was spent with regular callers who weren't even looking for "sexy talk", but just a sympathetic ear.   I was there part-time for a year, and we NEVER had a legitimately suicidal person call in crisis.
0	I have a similar story. I drove to Columbus, OH with some friends a few summers ago. One night we were driving back to our hotel and I made a u-turn and was driving in the shoulder a bit. I saw flashing lights in the rearview mirror so I pulled over. I had made an illegal u-turn without knowing it (in my state you can make a u-turn anywhere unless a sign tells you that you can't). I said we were just going back to our hotel. The cop was very nice to us, and asked if we knew that we were staying in a very dangerous hotel. He also informed us that a few hours ago someone was shot dead about a block from where we were staying, and that our hotel is well known for major drug trafficking in the area. Boy was he right. About an hour later I was on the phone in the hallway of the hotel and two very scary men, who barely spoke english, asked me repeatedly if I had seen anyone in the hallway and that they were looking for crack. They seemed frustrated that I didn't have any answers for them and I was pretty freaked out. One of the scarier moments of my life.
1	This one time in soloQQ I was playing jax against a nasus. I was all like "I ain't even mad". That's when Nasus was all like "I'm going AP... Woof!". Skip to lvl 8 or so. I've been zoned all game (he's just purple shnitzing every wave) and he's all like "BRO YOUR LOSING TO AP NASUS!... Woof!" skip to lvl 16. He's 1/11. half my cs. no Q. we win it easy. "You got carried jax. so lucky... Woof!". You can't really tell from my explanation but I'm fairly certain he wasn't trolling. he went to sleep that night rattled that I got carried against his awesomeness.
1	Looking at that guys' stats with champions in ranked, nowhere does he have a lower than .5 K/D ratio, and none of the deaths are more than 5.x/game. He doesn't troll when he plays the smurf, possibly it's a friend's account or he plays roles that he sucks at.   While he may pick and choose when he carries, he certainly doesn't blatantly throw any games he plays by his stats. His most recent loss looks to be a surrender where everyone on his team was pretty deep in the negative on kills. While he did go 0-3 in mid, it could be a DC issue.   It's probably a friend or relative's account by the score disparity between the games, he probably hops on every now and then to play a stomp game.
1	Be proud of the three pentas, sure, it's an impressive feat at any level, but I would not be proud about thrashing people far below my skill level.   Playing against smurfs is a frustrating and off-putting experience for the vast majority of the community. You might have a positive opinion of it, but it is rare to not hear 'fuck that guy, he smurfs' or 'I am so sick of smurfs' when you are suffering through a 20 minute game of being absolutely destroyed like those people were. This is ranked, bear in mind - people don't like to get destroyed, especially in ranked,  especially  against someone who, by all rights, they should never have faced. If it were normals then yeah I would agree - but it's not - and normally I am fine with box box and the like smurfing, but when they upload a video of them destroying low level players I have to vehemently disagree since that is when it becomes inconsiderate and condescending.   In this case I'm fine with him posting it since it  is  three pentakills which is pretty awesome, but I made my original comment so that people were aware of what they are being shown since any information other than 'while smurfing' was not provided. Additionally, with RES, people rarely go to Youtube itself and nothing in the OP title suggests it is even smurfing.   Edit:
1	As a result of several bans   Well, if you can't realize after several bans that your attitude is a no go, why should you have the opportunity to keep playing?   If your account wouldn't be permabanned and only banned for few weeks you wouldn't even bother and still flame on.   >  Also do you guys think I should maybe get a 2nd chance   Hell no. If you can't change after few days/weeks bans, you won't change
1	I didn't float around I went on a 13 win streak in  gold 1 into plat promo  went 1-3, won again went 2-3, won again went 3-0. And i'm not sure what your post is about anyway I
0	Violent video games are not shown to cause violence (excluding that all important fight to decide who gets first player). What people in the news misunderstand is that they have been proven to condition people, especially children and their gooey minds, with certain behaviors. The most educated people on the subject say many video games are a positive force inspiring thinking and problem solving so often left out of educations today.   What the media feeds on though is that this conditioning can result in violent behavior which is much more intense than the norm with less of an emotional response . Using an example from  On Combat  by Lt. Col. Grossman, (and I will paraphrase) a grade school child with no weapons training of any type was able to have a bullet to hit ratio higher than many in-training soldiers on range. Was the kid just a good shot? Not entirely, he held the pistol as seen on the screen (which was improper in a manner of speaking), and CONTINUED firing at RANDOM people after his bully had been shot. People he claimed after the fact he didn't even think about firing at, he just turned and fired. The important factors here are the video games he played displayed human targets and positively reinforced killing multiple targets of no particular nature. His problem though, was he was being bullied and reacted violently, as people have for years. But he was trained to kill without the weapons safety training that historically was required/given.
1	LP gains are based on the MMR (elo) distance to next promotion series.   Player 1 @ Silver 1 has 1600 MMR, 70 LP.   Player 2 @ Silver 1 has 1500 MMR, 90 LP.   Gold 5 is 1550 MMR.   Player 1 wins a game and gains 30 LP -> enters series. He already had the MMR needed for promotion series so the system really wants him there.   Player 2 wins a game and gains 3 LP, is now at 1515 MMR of the 1550 needed for series. Distance to series 35 MMR, but only 7 LP. Next games will be worth the around the same 3 LP for wins. Losses can be like -15 LP, but it doesn't mean much.   The weak LP gains like player 2 has are common in division 1 of any league. That's because the MMR distance between leagues is greater than the distance between divisions within the league. Only at Diamond 1 the LP truly shows the distance to promotion series I think.
1	All of the recent splash art updates have looked freaking fantastic.   However, the way they've been done doesn't allow for a good icon of the champion's face.   ie. Lee Sin's doing a bad ass dragon rage kick, but because of the angle of our perspective it makes his head look small and insignificant, leading to an awkward looking icon.   Cass is a bit different, but it's mainly because you can't see all of her head features in the icon, so she ends up looking like Wukong.   Xerath's new one took some getting used to, because it's clearly not a good portrait of him. The splash art is him in his ulti form and we're looking up at him making him look powerful and intimidating. He looks like a total badass controlling unfathomable amounts of power with his hands arced to his sides and hands grasping energy. Then you crop all of that out, and you're left with what looks like a lantern of some kind.
0	There's no reason to feel ashamed for what you're doing.  You obviously care about your mother, and that is respectable in the least.  I would suggest talking to a psychologist, dietician/doctor or other "professional" to see if there is any way you can get her more help.  Perhaps they may be able to help you find a potentially effective and ethical way to help her out.
0	I have a test tomorrow, i have to retake it because it is a qualifier for an oral exam. Last time i took it i was like - i studied, but wtf is this.  Atm i have read 150 pages from a book, but i dont think im smarter than the last time and have like 150 to go. Then i will have to reread like 10+ supreme court cases. And even then it might not be even enough to pass the test. The last time I even didnt understand why i dont know how to write the answers to the questions. I knew what they wanted and i knew what did the question ask from me, but nothing came out of the pen at that time.  I allready had an exam today so last night i didnt sleep much either, but i slept during the day so i think it will be a little easier. And then tomorrow after the test im going to have to start to study for another subject in which i have an exam on friday. After that it will be cool weekend, because i have another exam on monday.

1	Now, I obviously have no idea as to the actual numbers of the average age of players in League of Legends, let alone any of the other eSports that you would be capable of having. I feel like the only thing that would cause a problem is that having a bar implies having alcohol which implies being of age to drink.  Obviously you don't HAVE to drink in a bar, but it definitely could be a problem. Especially in the States, where the drinking age is 21.   In my opinion though, that would be something I would absolutely love to see happening, and I see it as more as a matter of time thing than a trial thing. As eSports grow in popularity, a more social aspect of them will be the next logical step.
0	Yes my best friend is an awesome guy. never talks to anyone hardly ever. but put me and him in a room and he doesnt stop talking. our personalities are almost opposite when it comes to being social. he is very awkward and i am rather outgoing and love to be out in social situations. i try to get him to come with me all the time and get shot down every time. thing is he has been my best friend since 5th grade (i am 24 right now) and i hardly hang out with him anymore because he doesnt wanna go anywhere. let this be a warning for some socially awkward people. im not going to sit here and tell you just put your mind to it and you can overcome it, because that would be ignorant as many issues such as this are more deep rooted. but one thing i will say is....TRY atleast make some type of effort to be social. saying that you "hate people or that everyone sucks" is a very bad generalization. because yes some people do suck but some are genuinely great. so make the effort to be atleast a little bit social and it might help the quality of your life. as humans we are social creatures by nature.
1	Personally, I hate playing against Teemo. At the same time, however, I love playing him.  But, lets look at the facts here: When played as an AP mid, the style that relies on his mushrooms, he will always be squishy, or else your damage suffers. If you are hard to kill, you deal no damage. In that case, everybody will just ignore you. You are forced to be a glass cannon with a miniscule range, no escape and a kit that has only one spell that can be used in team fights. You are extremely vulnerable to assassins with gap closers, you cant escape most bruisers, and you really feel the effects of your secret passive. You are basically like an AD carry, but with weaker abilities when it comes to staying safe. Also, nobody ever peels for you or protects you. The truth is, when you play Teemo, even your own team hates you and you have to spend the entire game proving yourself to them and proving that you picked right. You can get a triple kill and everybody will be 'meh'; you die once and they call you out for picking Teemo, trolling and feeding. You can do massive amounts of damage, your team won't care and I kid you not, they WILL NOT protect you in fights. As a Teemo, you cannot gank for shit, you cannot burst anyone down (until late game in some cases) and do any of the flashy plays other mids do. Its hard to carry a game on your own. If one of your lanes loses, they give up because there's a Teemo on their team, even if you are winning. Its not difficult to pull ahead in lane as Teemo, and you can choke the game out if you have an edge, but by God, if you are behind, it's ridiculously hard to win sometimes. Basically, with Teemo, you trade map control for shitty teamfights. Every champion brings something new to the game and players should adjust their playstyle accordingly. If the enemy wants to win, they should strategize and try to force fights where it's safe. They should try to catch somebody etc.
1	hey, i strongly disagree with this and i hope this doesn't get circlejerked to oblivion.... there were many many games where my team won with one player less in it and also numerous occasions where we lost with player advantage. I absolutely hate when someone disconnects and my teammates immediately start typing surr20 or starting surrender votes after 20 minute mark. It very much reminds me of situations with late teamcomp. Example of my own game:  Enemy team has a 20+ kills advantage over us but we have mundo and vayne in our team and blitz is continuously starting the surrender votes. The votes are barely denied (3/2) several times by me and vayne (i was mundo) and what happens, 20 minutes pass, vayne is farmed and i am unkillable and we win the game at 45 minute mark.
0	This is what I hate about Xbox Live. People say this all the time, "If you don't want to deal with kids online buy different games!" This is bullshit. If I remember right Call of Duty and HALO are Mature rated. I shouldn't have to deal with a 12 year old in the first place!
1	The fact that you are getting 2-3 kills and then dying is entirely on you. This game isn't a team deathmatch, and to be honest I would much prefer my team to kill a tank and take a dragon/baron/tower than for me to go in and get 2 kills in their back line and have the enemy tanks clean up my team.
1	Long time lurker, but I saw this thread and decided I should probably reply as Amumu is one of my favorite characters to play. For a little background information, I went 14-0 with Amumu before my first Amumu loss, when my summoner was lvl 20+ish, I have no idea what my ELO is. Amumu is an amazing tank in solo queue, nothing screams INTIATING like curse of the sad mummy, and even the worst pubbers will jump in.   IMHO he's definitely one of the top tanks, up there with Shen. Of course his biggest weakness is his early game, which is why I recommend jungling Amumu, and start ganking/pushing at level 7. As for why I think he's a great tank: in my experience the four things tanks need to be effective in LoL is survivability, initiation, protecting your teammates, and threat factor.     Survivability is Amumu's big weak point, his Tantrum provides minus 5 physical damage, so it's not that great. He is dependant on items, namely Sunfire capes for his survival. Good thing Sunfire capes synergize so well with his playstyle, more on that later. You can also get an Abyssal Sceptre for a great MR/AP/MR reduction item that also synergizes amazingly with Amumu.     Amumu has a strong initiation skillset, a ranged jump stun and AoE stun. Now you said Banshee's canceled out his ultimate, theoretically it also cancels out some other tank intiation abilities like Malphite's ult, Shen's taunt, and Rammus' powerball. You can use tantrum to remove the banshee's veil before you actually hit your ult, so you're not completely out of luck. Trick is you don't always have to use your ult right away. The great thing about Amumu is how his playstyle synergizes with his story. You pop despair, start crying and running towards the enemy wanting a hug, their natural reaction is to run in fear. Eventually someone will engage you, causing the rest of the enemy team to jump you. Tantrum to remove veils, and hit your ult. Now you have their entire team stunned in a small area, for the rest of your team to jump in and unleash hell.     Protecting teammates - Obviously you use the same stuns to protect your teammates. Also, you can run next to them crying and hitting them (to reduce magic resist, to increase the damage of all your skills and sunfires) and eventually they'll pull back (hopefully before they get your teammate). Obviously Shen wins in this department.     Threat factor - I have killed a many Ashe's in my days as Amumu. They can't kite you very well because of bandage toss and ult, and curse itself will take down 1/3rd of an Ashe's hp. Run up and hit em once for the MR reduction and tantrum and Ashe is now at half. Now chase and watch as Sunfire capes and Despair slowly kill them off if they stick around. Also since Despair has a health percent based damage component and his MR reduction, he can be a threat to tanks who may not have the proper MR or stacking just HP.       Why sunfire capes are great on Amumu: Four of his skills are point blank AoE damage. Sunfire cape is more point blank AE damage, gives him health and armor he needs for survivability and his passive MR reduction on hit increases the damage all his magic skills do on whoever it's on. Remember MR reduction can make their MR go negative, which is why he's very good versus squishy characters.
0	In the beginning maybe. The pay for an 18 year old with no college education is much better than the average civilian, but after a few years your peers catch up and the guys who stay in either like the life, or are afraid to get out. I have stayed in because I really love the work, the friendships I have made, and the realization that my job affects a bigger picture.  I like being able to go work and know that what I do today will save lives.   I think why people join is usually about the same reason, "pay for my school, take care of my bills, provide me work experience for when I get out", and you are not wrong to think that of us. However for the people who stay longer than the first enlistment, there are a few of us who really respect the work we do and feel it is work that needs to be done. I didn't stay for the spectacular pay because I can tell you, it isn't so great after the first couple of years. It starts to really peter out and your peers catch up as soon as they finish college, but the work you do really fills you with a sense of pride and responsibility.  I will never ask you to thank me for my service, but only that you respect our nations military for the sacrifice and price we pay each day to protect what we love and what we believe. I truly believe that I would rather risk my life day in and day out so that you do not have to, and I only ask that you need never "thank me" because what I do does not need appreciation. It is just something that must be done and I only ask that people who feel the way you do simply respect those who have laid down their lives to protect what they hold dear.   A lot of people seem to think very little of the military and that saddens me.  Too many people do their 4 years and get out then go on to belittle their experience to others and it paints a muddy picture of the whole military.  I know a lot more people who love the military and take pride in what we do than those who are just in it for the pay check. I also know many people who joined purely because they wanted to serve and felt they "owed" their country.
0	I whole heartedly agree, I suffered from a break up a year and a half ago, started bad taking a few months in, started taking to a new girl at school, she turned out to knowmy ex, relayed what I said back, ended up being one of the most hurtful days I've ever experienced, I regret every word, even though I did kinda feel that way, telling a person I didn't really know about it wasn't right.
0	In punishing folly, it does not further one to commit transgressions. The only thing that furthers is to prevent transgressions.
0	I understand this part of evolution and could see it playing a larger role in terms of bacteria or yeast competing with each other; but how much of an effect would producing an unnecessary metabolic pathway actually have on a person? Are there any diseases someone could link to where a person is displaying symptoms of producing proteins that hurt their fitness?   And I don't mean diseases with loads of unnecessary protein building up due to lack of regulation. I would assume normal levels expression for the vitamin C pathway proteins varying with the amount of vitamin C present.
1	I think that what a lot of people don't realize is that, while I agree that the changes were not a step in the right direction, and that there are problems in the jungle, the problems in the jungle are not nearly as easy to fix as everyone makes them out to be. The jungle is one of the most dynamic places that Riot has to balance, and it's not as simple as tweaking numbers. As a basis, many of the things which slow-clearing junglers/tank junglers need would be OP when applied to the current crop of top tier junglers (and some of the crop from last season). This creates a problem where creating an item, tweaking jungle monsters' numbers, etc. may fix the B, C, and D tiers, but they will still be the B, C, and D tiers. For the most part, the A tier will still be the A tier, and there will still be a similar pool of meta champions. The major difference will be in the relative power of junglers. Making tank junglers viable using numbers and simple items will usually force the A tier of junglers to become ridiculously strong, snowbally, etc. Riot's problem is that balancing the relative powers of all types of junglers at a decent level is a job that is much harder than it looks.
1	I enjoy singed because singed.   No other hero can have so much FUN running in and causing havoc. You don't have to deal very much damage to create mass disorientation and zoning of the enemy's.
1	I clicked the video for an informed comparison of the dynamic of the two games, not to hear this loser complain about my possible prejudices.
1	You say that the support is supposed to be killed last. However, when the supports had to do all the warding, they would often get picked off while on a warding mission as a way to get the upper hand in a coming teamfight. This way, supports and other squishy champs can ward where it is safe and more tanky champs can do the dangerous warding.   Also, an assassin as support will always be a risky pick, because of their inate weakness in 2v2 lanes. An assassin usually goes in only when a kill is within sight. In a 1v1 lane, if you have control of the enemy jungler, there is noone but your target to stop the assassination. If you go in on a marksman with an oldschool support, you stand the risk of getting silenced, stunned, slowed or exhausted, which usually means the end of an assassin. If the support has a heal or a shield, your calculation of burst vs. targets remaining hp may also be completely wrong. In addition, you have few ways to save the marksman during ganks or other kill attemps. (
1	That Kennen... they all played together so well. The reason I think they won, though, was because the only wards they used were pink ones.. and they would always delay long enough that when they set them down they would catch the other teams wards there.   Each player on poland got sort of fed just from catching stragglers everywhere.. all because of these wards covering the map. In the beginning they were losing teamfights horribly, but as it progressed they were just too strong even for CLG to pull off a team fight (especially because Polands team comp was built for team fights, I think they did this because they knew it would be their weakness against such a strong team).
1	DISCLAIMER: I am still a noob player so this probably doesn't apply to higher levels of playing   As a jungler, I can say that even though this sounds like a good idea, it's really not a good idea.   When they are in a bad position and you still go in, the laner thinks   "Time for me to Flash+Ignite+Ult! That'll get him!"   However, this ends up failing since the enemy can simply flash away and now we're looking at him/her camping turret and the laner we are helping now has only 3 abilities left to use, and this now makes it a win for the enemy laner. This also now also gives the other laners the ability to see that they can gank whatever that lane was and take the turret, and they will probably then start grouping while you+laner  are dead and your team is fighting a 3v5, which will not end well at all for your team.   And now the jungler has 2 options.     Run away, and hope the laner you just helped survives a 3v1, and just continue farming, OR     Sit there with the laner, fighting off in a 2v2, with the enemies having a MUCH better advantage because the person you just helped has used up their ult and summoner skills, but the enemy jungler is more than likely taking all the buffs and warding the jungle as well as running into the battle halfway and you both die.       Meanwhile all the other laners are busy running to help you, or too busy flaming and trying to take turret to think about you guys.
1	Honestly this is sad! Team Liquid organization gives in to the VERY "#KEEPKEITH" Spam that you find on twitch chat or wherever, which.. by the way.. WAS A FUCKING JOKE! It was the first week of LCS everybody is basically warming up to each other. If they believe that Keith is better than fucking piglet it's embarrassing to be a fan of TL. Now, what you're doing is fucking over Piglet and his confidence - making your team shittier + fucking over a lot of your fans who actually NOTICED THAT PIGLET IS GETTING DRASTICALLY BETTER WITH EACH AND EVERY GAME HE PLAYS.   end rant.

On people getting up in arms about blaming the devil for thing that are done: Satan isn't omnipotent, omnipresent, or omniscient. Most of the crap that people do is simply because we are a broken and sinful people. We are plenty depraved without the devil getting involved.

0	Before you knew about the internet, you had the phone. You knew how to use the phone, quite well! A rotary phone at that! But, interneting? That sounds so strange--I mean, sure the phone makes sense--but, images, instant text messaging in real time, videos, that's way too futuristic and, how does that even work?!   Now, maybe you do buy into this "internet" thing and you wanna see it and give it a go.  Now, pretend, that the "internet" is many miles away and only one guy has it, maybe. THIS information, is only based on a rumor, after all; all you've ever really seen is some soldiers from a far land fighting your "bordering state" neighbors.   Well, to get to this "internet" you have to go past that war zone, and with you being stuck in the phone age, what happens if they cut the phone off while you're away? You may never see your family again. Never see your homeland. Never even make it to the internet. So what if it does have all that amazing stuff you hear about; maybe staying with your family is for the best. You may be poor, but you know you have them.   After all, you've never seen evidence that the internet is really there. And plus, what can it do for you? The owner of the internet doesn't know you, why would you get a share of it? No, maybe it is for the best to stay here.  Maybe.   Plus, your family needs you here. Pops is getting old, mom too. Gotta help take care of the younger siblings. Know what? The internet is too much of a gamble.  This is just the cards you're dealt. You wouldn't even know how to talk in internet. Hopefully the fighting will stay on that other side and you can at least live your life in peace.
1	Coast are heavy favorites in this tournament. Noone was saying LoLpro was the best or even 2nd best. They 2-0'd today not dropping 1 game. They may have looked shaky but never for a whole game. In every single week of every sport there is a team that should dominate someone but they only end up winning by a small margin.
0	I don't know about the US but in Australia having a un-managed hive on your property is probably illegal. Firstly you cannot control the swarming, and therefore can be a nuisance to other people. Secondly and more importantly, having a wild hive is a vector for bee disease; small hive beetle, viruses, and other disease which can be transmitted to another hive. And the fact that the hive isn't managed means that diseases go unnoticed, and unmanaged.
1	I hardly think win-rate is the sole determining factor of success. How often a champion is used will certainly impact it's win-rate (mains vs. FotM players). Additionally, many of the complaints about champions has been their impact on the game. With the jungle being harder than ever, it's difficult for many like Sejuani and Amumu to become any more than glorified supports. Their only use is teamfight changing ultimates. That's why they've always (always being very, very relative, but iirc amumu used to have like a 56% winrate) been successful. Not because of their early game impact, but because late-game a 5 man amumu ult is a 5--man amumu ult. No scaling, no jungle successful-ness. He's on the team for the same reason a support is.   Vi: one of the "viable" junglers. Insaeely good clear, healthiness in the jungle, and powerful ganks. Can "carry" the game in the traditional jungle sense.   Fiddle: Always ranked highly in higher Elo, safe clears, powerful ult ganks.   Sejuani: Ult Bot. Poor clears means she can't make the early ganks or counterjungling associated with carry jungler.   Amumu: Ult bot. See Sejuani above (also, it's so easy for a Vi or Shaco or anything to steal his blue and make his life hell)   WW/Shaco/Udyr/Nunu: Sustain junglers. These guys can farm the jungle for days. Shaco is a niche pick that will almost always be godly in the hands of a main. Udyr has no problem farming and splitting, but is the opposite of the traditional ganking carry jungler. WW, sustain farm to 6, point and click ult-cc bot   I could go on but the point is that most of your list is sustain bruiser junglers or late-game ult bots. One farms, another has limited early-game impact, and feww are the strong early gankers. Another fact that's hard to forget is the fact that (almost) every game has 2 junglers, one must win and one must lose. Factor in ban-rates (Nidalee, J4, Vi all very high on the ban list) and you'll see that it's less a matter of who is being picked and more a matter of how impactful they can be. Many, many people's "jungle fantasy" (AKA their ideal of what a jungler should be) isn't a sustain bot or ult bot, it's a champ that ganks or counter-jungles and carries through kills. Tanks junglers who have early CC struggle from poor clears and can't do early ganks, and bruisers like wukong, for example, barely have any hp after camp #3.
0	the problem here is that I've found any good strategies that can be effective at overcoming traditional roadblocks or breaking from the script and which seem smart are only effective for as long as they can remain novel.   Any formalised strategy or approach that one has read about or devised themselves, when employed routinely in a situation where conflict is frequent will eventually be picked up on by the person you frequently fight with and actively resisted.
0	Its not really about what you eat its more about how much of it you eat (In regards to gaining weight, not health). I could eat a McDonald's meal everyday, but if that's the only meal i eat during the day I'm never going to gain any weight because i haven't taken in enough calories.   Where as if i eat healthy but i eat a shitload of it and never stop eating throughout the day I'm going to get fat because I'm taking in more calories then i burn.   (
1	Kind of piggybacking off of the idea with a question regarding shotcalling -   So in my team I think that we would really benefit from a shot caller because our communication is absolutely terrible, everyone yelling etc. The problem is, of the 5 people we have:   myself (mid) , I constantly watch streams and practice new things, all 4 agree that I'm the best all around and could play all but top in the team. because of this, i think that i'd be the best shot caller   a friend that's very angry however once he gets into top lane he's awesome in the 1v1. he's on a very high level of play with 2 champions - darius and garen. he doesn't play garen in ranked 5s and feels the need to take every kill with darius ult. he won't learn new people for more than one game, always goes back to darius. is in complete opposition to me being shot caller   our ADC is very calm and thinks I should be caller, really just been working on cs with lots of champs has been his thing   our support is indecisive and hardly talks, if he does it's hard to understand (MID MID MID = their adc is half hp and we can't see him.) he won't give input on who should be the shot caller for fear of the solotop or myself getting pissed at him (he does this with a lot, victimizes himself irl a lot)   our jungler hardly talks, doesn't say anything about what he can improve though he knows that he needs to improve.   So I've got this - if we go for straight democracy I'll be noted as caller, but our solotop will flip shit. what way of determining caller do you think we should use?   god, that was a wall of text.
1	This has become so annoying. As some other dude said   "Even though SIJ might be the best out of all amateur teams that's how it works. They secured one of the last spots for the promotion tournament which means they have to face the highest placed LCS team."   SO HOW IS THIS UNFAIR? Atn have been a team for like a year now and SiJ are like 1 month old, maybe they are on a winning streak now just as aAa were before 1 year in EU and crushed everybody in online tourneys, yet a month later they just lost to almost everyone.   How can you know which team is better based on 3-4 games? Let me remind you that Wolves were 0-8 in the beggining of the LCS.  You'll say that Bjergsen was not there, still GGU didnt have shiptur and managed to go 2-8. LCS is all about giving the chance to a team to become pro, to have a gaming house and everything needed to compete with the best and, maybe, become one of the best. To me , little does it matter who will get in since I'm sure that whoever goes in will become better and thats the whole point.
1	You know  exactly  what you're doing though. You're not the victim of some crime, you know when you queue up there's a chance of trolls, and you know that you always dodge them and are familiar with the penalties.   As I've said in each of the three posts about this, champ select trolls make up such a small amount of games that queue dodging  is a realistic way to combat them . If you get a troll in champ select when you are 1-1 on promos  this makes up such a vanishingly small portion of the game that it is not worth affecting every single champ select to solve it . Sometimes your luck just sucks, shit happens in life same as in league. That promo will be one of hundreds of games you will play, it makes up a tiny portion of your games.   Do you really not see that adding in a vote to kick system would be far more abuseable and probably cause vastly more problems,  because it is present in 100% of champion selects  than it solves. You're talking about changing the dynamics of 100% of games to solve a problem that probably happens in less than 5% of games overall.   The only thing the system needs, is an option to report in champion select, or for champion select to be included in the report system.   You will  never ever  create a system that is perfect, and it does suck, but even if u solved this problam, there was probably an equal chance that you loaded into your promos 1-1 and someone DCed. That's what kind of chance you're talking about.
1	One solution I have is disable your graphics cards then re-activate them. It won't hurt them or your system. I had major Fps issues during 4.21 and so on then I did that to try and fix another and after doing that it fixed my league Fps issues. I now run everything maxed on my laptop and get 60-70. I recently had to turn them down to medium because I had issues, but I think that was league being a shitter.
1	I wanna say that i came on to this subreddit with the intent to post something to this nature. I feel the hostility is overpowering. I also want to comment on something a little racey!!!! I really do hate when i am playing and a teammate doesn't talk the whole match, follow lane calls, or even when they steal farmed minions. (when you are fighting wolves and they come up and get the last shot on a small wolf)(i mean come on right)so they don't talk the whole match and then near the end after denying 3 surrenders (they are 0/11 by this point) they come in speaking spanish saying something uncomprehendable. Then when google translate comes into play ("I own this game, im the best") is what it translates. I think ok troll you dont speak english, you are playing a team game, and you have nothing to say about feeding or stealing minions except that you own this game and are the best? Sorry got off on a tangent.
0	i'll assume this was real, which it's not.   there's nothing controversial about it.  there really isn't. if a woman wants to feed her baby in a restaurant, then she can do it.   if it's a big deal to you, if you have a problem with this, then leave.  there is no controversy, there is nothing wrong here, the only problem is that a few people have a problem with the fact that infants need to regularly eat and that they naturally do this by latching onto a breast.
1	Maybe but I have been through quite some games and I don't want to "train" myself (maybe because I don't play much ranked) and there are games when you know your only hope is a disconnect from the enemy carry or a really big mistake from the whole enemy team - and it happens sometimes - but it's really rare. I'll enjoy more a close defeat because even if you lose, you know you've been battling fiercely.
1	i love assassins! The only game i cannot stand playing the assassin class is WoW rogues (although i have not capped on them yet so who knows). Zed, Shaco, and Leblanc all came to me naturally. Kha'zix and Katerina were hard at first but i loved every minute of them. my favorite assassin atm is zed, but behind that is full damage yasuo. i count yasuo full damage build as an assassin cause he just jumps on the enemy line with two quick spells and deletes the enemy carries.
0	Parents get into the mindset of "I made you, so you're obligated to obey me".  My mom likes to go on power trips whenever I go to my hometown to visit.  I don't have a social life here, so I try to spend time with my brother and cousin when I'm there.  My hometown is rather dull and depressing, and there's very little to do, so we usually try to go out to the bar to play pool once or twice while I'm home.  My mom knows that she's my best option as a babysitter for my five year old son.  To make things simpler for her, I usually try to go out after his bedtime so I can just put him to bed and have her check on him from time to time.  But no! If I go out to the bar, that means I could drink and, "If you don't get tipsy off two beers and good and drunk with three, then you're an alcoholic."   That's her trump card- refuse to babysit to keep me from leaving the house, "to protect me from my alcohol problem."  But my 22 year old little brother who still lives at home can go to the bar, spend fifty bucks on drinks and walk home drunk whenever he wants without a word from her.  She'll sometimes babysit when he asks her to.  But for the most part, I have to take my son with me everywhere I go, and the highlight of my winter visits is putting my son to bed and drinking beer on the porch with my brother.  Sharing a twelve pack and still being in control of our faculties is our favorite way of infuriating her.
0	As someone who's a fan of the genre and of the idea of the show, I find that it's a show like the X-Files, where you can sit down and watch it from the beginning and plow through, which many people (myself included) have done with both shows (at least new Dcotor Who).   But the intent, I believe, in showing them those specific episodes are to use them to try and create a fan of the show in one episode. Two of the three episodes mentioned aren't typical "best" episodes, but rather ones that establish a kind of reference point for what the show is. And, if you like those episodes, chances are that you'll like the show as a whole.   The show, like the X-Files, is one with a broad spectrum of quality, largely centered in the "pretty good" section. There are certainly bad episodes to go with the very good ones, and because of its genre, it's a show that is very popular in communities like Reddit, so it probably gets more discussion than it merits. But it's still a fun, largely good show.
1	There are a few reasons why this is a counterpick.   1) Riven can't trade with Fiora in the first couple levels because of Fiora's Parry.  Most of Riven's dmg comes from her passive, and to have one of the charges not only mitigated, but thrown back at you, hurts a lot.   2) Rivens usually run AD for the scaling on her E, but Fiora's often run full armor ben because she gets the equivalent of AD Reds & Quints for free with her W.  AD is great for a lot of things, but armor pen is just better for trading against champs with armor.   3) If Fiora gets W'd by Riven, the stun isn't long enough and Riven can't get away fast enough to get away from Fiora's 2nd Q.  This hurts Riven by taking away her greatest strength in lane: the ability to trade harass free.  If any of Riven's CDs are blown, Fiora can go aggro mode.  If she can bait out your W, Fiora can go aggro mode.  And it hurts.   Now, how do you beat Riven then?   USE YOUR JUNGLER.  Fioras will pick Fiora against Riven knowing how the matchup goes.  You can actually blow CDs to bait Fiora into going aggro on you.  If your jungler can wait for the moment she blows her CDs and starts to go aggro on you, you can almost surely net a kill every time.  Fiora has no escapes in her kit (other than Q and E which are situational, and she should've blown Q to get on you and she will have only taken 1 point in E if she's playing the matchup to counter you so its not like 7% movespeed for a couple seconds is gonna help) and is squishy as all hell.  An early oracles on a jungler or, if you know where she is warding, a pink ward, can change the game entirely.  "But a good Fiora won't go aggro unless she has vision"  Well, she can't trade with you then so congrats on the free lane.   And yes, there are other more general reasons why Fiora counters Riven (Riven being no innate sustain, relatively squishy, etc.), but those are the 3 I find most interesting.   **
0	Your problem sounds like you think being a "good guy" is your make or break quality. Yeah, I like people who are genuinely nice people but that is not enough to make me want to be friends with someone if they aren't interesting or funny or smart or passionate or have any other number of things going for them to make them the kind of person I would want to spend time with.   Having someone be nice to me and treat me well is a huge turn on, but that is not all I want out of a relationship. I like to surround myself with people who make me laugh, or have an interesting perspective on the world and can lend a different and mind-broadening insight to things we might experience differently, or people who introduce me to new things that they love and think I might love too. That goes for friendship but obviously extends to anyone I might be attracted to as well. You don't have to be The Most Interesting Man in the World or be James Dean level handsome for someone to want to date you, but you do have to have something going for you.
0	You have been personally pointed at and laughed at while in a gym?   You are implying that people who workout at the gym are the equivalent to bullies, who want to take time out of their work out to stop and specifically ridicule you? No. You are being egocentric. Everyone isn't thinking about you or probably even care that you are there. Stop it.   Do you honestly just feel a bit bashful and nervous to start? Work out in your house then.

1	Wow thanks for the thread. Streaming was always difficult for me due to the need of doing long sessions to pull in viewership as a player. I like to play 1-2 games, take a break, play 1-2 more etc.   Also current limitation is internet at home. It's not very good! but I could try streaming on it, I think my current laptop can handle the load of streaming.   I'll talk to the other casters and they can teach me how stream setup actually works nowadays and I'll give it a try, but I may never be able to pull off the long streaming sessions like Rivington and Phreak can.

0	Well, I personally have given up on Reddit, I don't bother to try and make intelligent comments because they get downvoted and whoever replies to my posts is going to ignore any discussion I attempt to make.  For quite a while now I've just been making one liners and posting on small subs where actual discussion can take place.   I just read others' futile attempts at intelligent discourse and lose my appetite to bother typing out a long reply with sources just to get downvoted and sneered at.   /r/science is full of shit articles, /r/worldnews is the same two simplistic arguments over government and society a week, /r/politics is where the highschool and college aged kids go to be activists,  /r/truepolitics  /r/politicaldiscussion is where those-who-think-they-know-how-the-world-really-works go, bleh.   Too many people that want to just make jokes while pretending to be open minded.  If I want to have a discussion about politics or technology or economics or anything, I'll go talk to a friend.  At least real life interactions require, minimally, an iota of intellectual accountability.  Reddit is for jokes, spreading over-sensationalized news, participating in mock activism and circlejerking.   With that said;
1	I think they should have captions. I watch everything with captions because I used I live in an apartment with asshole neighbors who would complain at the littlest noise. It has gotten to the point where I almost can't watch a movie or show without them because the words almost jumble together in my ears. I love watching esports but its hard to watch them when you also have to be quiet, or if you just prefer softer sound.   Another actual reason is I would really love to listen to music and watch esports but its hard because I am forced to listen to the game.
0	I hate to wreck the party, as this comment is actually pretty funny, but heroin won't pass for insulin. (unless the person who found it has no idea what either one is supposed to look like) From a standard dealer you're only ever going to find powder/pill form. True you could cook it to clean it up a bit, then try to bottle it, but it will clump eventually from what I've seen. Also, If you found a dealer selling "liquid heroin" you're probably getting ripped off.
0	While I'm not sure I agree or disagree with you. My experience was the complete opposite. When my parents split my mom was very open with our financial situation, we lived off savings and her retirement in addition to child support for a good while. My brother and sister were both competitive ice skaters and easily burned through $1000 a month, to pay for this they started doing odd jobs as they were too young to get real ones.   My sister started baking cookies and taking them to soccer games to sell, she was making several hundred dollars a week at the age of 12, 13. Eventually she started babysitting and was very industrious, working 40+ hours a week to support her ice skating.   I on the other hand was a little older, but I got a job at the local grocery store, then moved into restaurant work, I continued to work in a restaurant all through college. Eventually working two jobs while completing one of the hardest majors offered at my school. My brother and sister eventually got into restaurant work as well. I moved out at 18 but eventually my sister started paying 1/3 the rent on the house my mom sister and brother lived in. When she got married my mom asked me and my roommate to move in with her because she couldn't afford the rent.   As a result of all this my siblings and I are much more independent and fiscally responsible than our peers. We are well accustomed to school in the morning, work at night, and 10-12 hour days on the weekend.   My sisters 22 and last year she bought a house with her husband, she still works 2 jobs while going to college (paying for the whole thing out of pocket, no student loans). I recently finished my Bachelors and am starting my PhD at a top University in my field of biochemistry. My brother has had a harder time but he's still managing to pay for his own college.   All throughout history children were not just taken care of but expected to contribute to the family, generally that meant working on the farm or helping in some other profession. In recent years we've lost this attitude and children are sheltered from the real world. Perhaps that is why so many young adults are up to the ears in credit card debt, and student loans, unable to be financially independent from their parents.   Now I recognize that my situation is a bit unique my siblings and I were all homeschooled (which by the way I wouldn't trade for anything) and this obviously allowed us to pursue more options that wouldn't be available to other people during normal school hours. However, I think many of the lessons are still applicable. My advice to parents would be, as far as is within reason share your finances with your children, teach them how to manage money, and think of creative ways they can contribute to the family, you'd be surprised at how much a kid selling cookies at a soccer game can really make.
0	Story time!   In fourth grade I had a friend and his name was Kato. He had come to my house a few times to spend the night and I thought it would be cool if we went to his house for a change. He lived in this giant old Victorian house with his grandmother older brother(7th grade) and father. Now his father was in a wheel chair for something. Could not move his legs but could wheel himself around, he talked kinda slow but still communicated fine. We hung out and played Nintendo until his older brother came home late around 6pm instead of right after school like he was supposed to. They found out his older brother was out and about and stole some stuff from a swap meet. So his dad starts yelling at him in front of us and his grandmother. It gets to the point were his father tries to discipline the older brother but him being handicap made it hard. His older brother fought him off a few times before he ran to the stairs. At this point his brother turned and started taunting his father with stuff like "Oh come up the stairs if you can cripple old man, try and get me, come on you can do it, oh wait you cant walk ahahahah" It got to the point were his dad clawed his way out of his wheel chair and started climbing the stairs on his hands. While he was trying to climb the stairs the older brother would push him down the stairs a few steps or slap him in the face while he was trying to make it up the steps. All while taunting him calling him cripple. It ended with the older brother laughing as he went up the stairs to his room. His father sat crying at the bottom of the steps, out of his wheel chair and his grandmother crying and yelling at the older brother. Kato was in tears but not making any noise. After his dad got back in his chair his grandmother came to me and said "Come child ill take you home now". I asked if Kato wanted to come spend the night and she said it wouldn't be a good idea for him to stay over at my place. Kato left my school after a month and I really never heard from him again. Kinda sad, wonder what happened to him.
1	Are you sure about that?   A lot of people often confuse games won with games played because Riot puts significantly more emphasis on games won. I've played over 4000 matches of league and I'm still sitting on my 999th normal win hoping to get my 1000th with a Rioter. You have to account for the fact that each queue measures win/loss independently, and each ranked season starts you over at 0/0 in ranked queue (I played about 1400 ranked matches alone last season).
1	So this reply is a little late, but it's something that has really helped me out.  From watching a lot of higher elo streams I noticed that they use their summoners spells sparingly.  The biggest example of this would be flash.  Before picking up this little tip I would flash away from an enemy that was going to kill me only to have him catch up to me and kill me anyways.  Now instead of just gut reaction flashing myself out of a bad situation I will wait a little, see if I can walk to a better position and flash myself over a barrier or back to a tower.  You will die a lot less and you may even find that it will help you calm down and evaluate a team fight better, i.e. positioning and targeting a lot better when you know your exit strategy should things get ugly.
0	I live in the suburbs of Detroit, Michigan and nobody dares to keep their shoes on when going inside. It's not as if it's an insult, people will just yell at you for tracking mud around the house (even if there is no mud anywhere), and people will take their shoes off in public for whatever excuse they can think of. It's less that we don't trust the ground in our houses but that we don't want to get the floor dirty. Shoes are seen as protection from the ground, and are therefore dirtied by what is on whatever public ground you were recently on. It's that I don't want muck from the street in my kitchen. If you are sitting on a couch and want to put your feet up, I would rather you put your protected feet or socks up than muck-infested foot-protectors.   Taking shoes off is also like putting hats on a hat rack; it's a sign of welcome and friendliness. It is often paired with the phrase: "come in, make yourself at home." People who keep their shoes on either look like they are leaving or like they are extremely uncomfortable in your house, or they look like they are really stressed about something to the point that taking shoes off seems unimportant, at which point someone tells you to take your shoes off, to relax yourself, to keep your mind off it.   Well, that's my interpretation of Michigan's shoe etiquette, at least.
0	No. People really do judge you if you're a male in a park/playground. Like /u/GotNoms said, some go as far as calling the police. There was a situation once where a guy's daughter was making a scene and crying in a store, and to not disturb/bother others, he picked her up and took her outside. He got the cops called on him. For interacting with his own child... That story ended well, though. The cops saw that it was just his daughter and had a word with the people who called the cops (they had grouped together to watch).
1	Yeah, when I started playing my friends recommended fiddlesticks as an "easy champ to learn" (he was free that week) I only played fiddle, and never an other champion untill about level 25... Looking back to that time, I really want to play him again but he doesn't fit anywhere anymore so that makes me really sad :\   >
1	Hmm would we like it, YES BUT- I think humble bundles really take advantage of the whole thing. They even show you the stats of the avg payment and its always like 1$ for a boat load of stuff
1	I am not great at the game but what I always see when the game is going bad is people who run in after the fight.   If your the other side of the map and you dont have teleport or ghost, only leave if your lane leave. Half of the time if you leave and run in you wil get cleaned up on the way or after the fight. I play alot of support and this what I always see with my ap carries. The only time I have seen it work without teleport or ghost is with very very feed characters.   Next dont push your lane, last hit. My friend is terrible at this and we always get ganked first because we are push up to their towers. Alot of people argue that at your tower you cannot get cs (creep score), however remember two tower hits for melee and one for caster minions. What I find, when I have a good jungler is if they are pushed close to our tower at ~lvl 3,4,5 they get ganked and killed.  I find a similar thing happens to us, if I haven't warded.   Next topic, WARD! Dont be the dick who tells me that I need to ward because I am support. The whole team needs to ward. Do not expect a support to ward your side of the map for you. If you have a free spot in your inventory and a spare 75 gold, your doing it wrong.   Lastly if you auto attack a champion with minions close by, the minions will target you. Save your auto attacks for when there are less then 3 minions (unless you have support etc... just a rule of thumb) how ever use this to your advantage and bait.
1	This is exactly how I pictured it.  Dexter link duo, link feeding, dexter raging.   Now, in 99% of cases (soloq b5 -> D1) I'd say Dexter is the problem, but given that they are a  professional team  it's the feeders fault.  Dexter shouldn't rage, but at the same time, it'd be frustrated to play with a midlaner as mechanically lacking as Link.   edit: To compare to real sports- Tom Brady is praised for yelling at teammates/receivers when he feels they aren't hustling or playing their best.  It's what leaders do.  In fact, sometimes people need to be yelled at/scolded to take a hint.
1	I realize this is an incomplete answer, but something that helps me keep cool is explicitly distinguishing between areas that affect me versus areas I am able to affect.   Here's a (albeit cheesy) framework we can use to categorize events in our life:   Circle of Concern: All things that matter to us in some way.   Circle of Influence: Things we can do something about.   [Illustration](   Our Circle of Influence is both within and significantly smaller than our Circle of Concern. Areas of our life which fall within our Circle of Concern but outside of our Circle of Influence warrant our attention, but we simply are unable to do anything about them (by definition).   Lets take some common things in League that fall within our two circles:   Concern:     I have toxic teammates arguing stubbornly over a lane in draft.        I disapprove of my teammate's unconventional (in my opinion nonviable) champion pick.        I have been counter-picked and have to play a very difficult lane matchup.       My teammate disconnected and I'm forced to play a 4v5.        My bottom lane has been feeding badly during laning phase, and I am now dying as a top-laner to a fed enemy AD carry during teamfights.          (note: These examples are something you could potentially do something about in certain situations, (e.g. politely asking your teammate if they will change their unconventional champion pick) but I feel they illustrate things that may upset us while playing.)   Influence:     I can communicate to my jungler my concerns surrounding my lane matchup and let he or she know I would like an early gank if possible.       I can adjust my build in anticipation of teamfights versus a fed enemy champion from another lane.        I can ignore toxic chat and instead focus on productive discussion that contributes to team coordination.        As a top lane, I can offer to swap with my mid who is having difficulty in a particular matchup.        As a jungler, I can cover mid lane after my teammate AFK's.          We get angry. It happens. The important thing for us to do is ask ourselves:   "Is this something that's in my Circle of Concern or Circle of Influence?"   There will always be many more things in life that affect us than there are things we can do something about. By clarifying which is which, we are able to not waste any unnecessary time and attention in the first area, and we can effectively allocate our limited resources into the second.   Extra notes:   This is not my original idea, but it's something which has been absolutely formative of my attitude in life.   It's true that this framework can be further  parsed into Circle of Concern/Influence/Control, but I believe this is largely unnecessary towards the purpose of this post.

While there are people who argue for the most extreme versions of these statements, I think there are plenty of non virgin, non sheltered, adults who could intelligently argue the underlying sentiments behind the two issues. Such as "you should try to be financially stable before you have kids" or "regardless of the attackers gender you have a right to self defense."

I don't give a crap one way or another since NintendudeX is like 17 or some shit, and a teenager is going to make a lot of stupid decisions and say a lot of stupid. But you should realize that he is digging a hole deeper by responding.   Best course of action honestly right now is just to shut up and wait a week, and then respond after everybody is done blowing this out of proportion and he can think put a thought out response.
0	sigh  so my drive into work today - it's as if someone knew I made these posts and pulled this shit. There is an exit in the passing lane on the way to work, but it's accessible by the middle lane too. Of course the slow guys use the left-most lane because it makes their merge onto the next highway easy.....but they don't need to get in that lane 5 miles before the exit...
1	No, I know what this guy is talking about because it happened to me during Sugar Rush. Little Red Riding Annie was legacy, but when i got Annie in an Aram i decided to buy that skin which opened up the store in champ select and let me buy it, BUT I couldn't select it until the next game because the client only displayed the normally available skins in the sliding list.
0	We get called on a weekly basis. Actually, we moved from Portland to Campbell and then to Walnut creek in just under 2 months. It was butts.   Simply turning our uhaul in in Concorde froze our credit card account. We called and had it unfrozen after confirming the sale. Then we went to do laundry....using the laundromat in Concorde froze our card. We had it unfrozen and went on about our business. Getting donuts in Concorde on the way back from my parents froze our card...had to call to unfreeze it. And once again, doing laundry at a different place (with eco-friendly services) froze our card again. I'm doing laundry again this weekend. Wish me luck.
0	The big thing to remember is that the winning/losing isn't about hurt feelings or showing off; at least in the sense of flirting it is much more complex than that.  It sends a subliminal message about your personality and priorities as they relate to her.  If you are comfortably dating or just friends, that's different.  But I assume here that you are curious about more novel and potentially romantic situations.   Whether or not you should give it your all depends on the person, it's just something you are going to have to learn to read.  Some girls hate a guy who lets them win as they see it as disingenuous, others see it as a positive aspect of his personality.  If you don't know her that well then I would suggest the latter as even the first type of girl will recognize that it is kind of the social norm in those situations.  But if you already know the girl pretty well then you are the best judge.   In the more "traditional" cases, it's good to lose in what I can only describe as a joking manner.  You kind of act disappointed but it is clearly an act (being disappointed) and she knows it.  This opens the door for some flirtatious trash-talking.  It also demonstrates that you are more interested in her than the game.  Generally try to lose by a close margin as this maximizes the flirtatious chatter, which is a good fallback if the conversation starts to get stale.  Flirty lines like, "well if you hadn't distracted me with that smile maybe I would have made that last goal," will usually elicit a positive response (cheesy, but go for it.  It makes you seem funny and daring and the subtle compliment will get her thinking in the right direction).   I guess a cynical person could see it as you just playing a game with her head, baiting her into your romantic trap.  Personally, I just think that kind of flirting is fun.  It shows that you can make light of the trivial things and put the spotlight on her.  Just make sure not to lay it on too thick.  Charmers aren't the ones who seem cocksure and aggressive, they're the ones who seem confident and comfortable in their own skin, willing to just let their personality show without having to prove anything.

1	he sure did,after i wrote my response,not before
1	I feel like literally talking out of one's ass is a pretty amazing feat. That said, in MLB, for example, there is a flat bonus paid out to teams as a cash award for reaching certain playoff goals: winning the World Series, AL, etc.   All active players, starters or not, generally receive the exact same share. The team votes on what share to give to players who only spent a portion of the year on the roster. Salaries, just as they are in esports, are a separate issue.
1	As jinx early on when she was released I got really far ahead in lane with about 5 kills and 2 assists, and was far outfarming the enemy cait. Our top and mid were both holding their own but at about 13 minutes in our jungler starts making some really bad decisions amd gets caught out multiple times, sometimes costing lives with him. At 20 mins he starts surrender vote and when we didnt say yes he rage quit. My support and top (both friends) held our lanes and the mid (the junglers friend) decided to hang on with us. They pushed us back to our base but we aced our outkilled them in teamfights for 35 minutes, even managing to take an inhib before they finally killed us. The twisted fate mid also asked us to report his friend and I added him, really awesome guy and we all joked in chat about going down fighting the whole time.
1	The only time I would watch anyone else play is when you literally know nothing about what you want to try to do.   For example, if you've never jungled before but you'd like to become good at it, it'd be a great idea to watch theOddOne's stream to learn the basics. Once you feel like you have some basic overarching strategy (maybe some items to start with, champions you feel you might like), just stop watching streams and get better yourself. You have to realize that you won't win games doing what the pros do because the pros play an entirely different game than you do.   If we were to talk in ELO brackets, there are different metagames present at different ELO's.  At low elo, for example, amumu is a very popular pick and ban, but you don't see this at mid to high elo. This is solely because CC is king in low elo, and amumu has awesome CC. Nocturne is awesome at low elo, crappy at mid elo, and awesome again at high elo. At low elo, people are so out of position that he gets free kills throughout the entire game with his ult. Then in mid elo, he loses a lot of his power because people learn to play with his ult in mind. Then at high elo he gets good again because players learn to pick champions that synergize with his dive playstyle.   The main point I'm trying to make here is that you should find out what wins the games you're in. Don't worry about what the pros are doing because chances are, unless it's blatantly OP, it's not going to work for you like it does for them. Find a champion that you do well with, and figure out why you do well with them. You'll find that strategies are what wins games, not what champions you pick. Pick champions that accomplish things you want to do in game. For example, take advantage of the fact that people lack map awareness at low elo and play ganking junglers. Eventally, that's not going to have as great of success for you, so move onto something else.
1	I'm not trying to bust any bubbles here, but I feel like top lane is the one lane that is most dependant on picks and counterpicks. Sure, champs like Yorick, Trynd, Riven, Irelia, Singed are good picks, ALMOST regardless of teamcomp, but there's matchups where some champs just get shat on while others really shine. Top lane is such a volatile lane in general, and I really feel like mechanical skills pay off the most up there.   A good example would be Nasus. Nobody will disagree if I say he's one of the scariest late game heroes ever, yet he can easily get shut down by lots of champs early on which are capable of snowballing their advantage to a point where Nasus almost becomes a non-factor besides Wither and his semi-decently farmed Q. The variety of champs shutting him down vary from early game monsters with a comparetively weak late game (Renekton, Pantheon) to absolute late game wreckers (Riven, Olaf, Trynd). I like the idea of a tier list in general, but I am not sure if the top lane is a lane to do a tier list on.   Edit: This becomes even more true if you take all the AP champs who typically go mid, yet are capable of top laning into account, say Morg, Kennen, Vlad, Ryze and such.
1	Yea, it's at like the second to last page or something. But the
0	Well ultimately one could simply ask them, would you rather live in Africa or the First World? And should they prefer the First world, then they themselves got the good end of the deal for their lineage, the suffering of their ancestors, which I am in no way justifying, benefited them in a way that I, among others, view as a very large reason behind their current quality of life, and possibly success.
0	Am I the other one who thinks this meme is pointless, you can grab a comment from one redditor and a comment from the other and put it to together to make a scumbag.   In the end the combined view doesn't exist, and if it does lots of redditors would be opposed to it anyway.
0	Wife here posting this story;husband is trying to calm down.   My husband has 2 jobs currently, a National Guard and a security guard in our town.   Today's shift is usually an easy one, guarding a bank and its parking lot. A 8a-4p shift; usually he is back home no later than 410pm when he has this location.   430p rolls around and he is not home- odd. 5 min later he pulls up; but, instead of coming upstairs to greet me and our dogs like normal, he books it to the downstairs entrance and I hear the shower turn on. He does not take showers right as soon as he walk through the door and it was not hot enough today to sweat soo much.   So I am thinking that something was thrown at him or shat on. I go down stairs to see what happen. I ask the standard question of "are you okay?" and get "yes and no"...   Husband: " I am washing blood off of me and sanitizing myself!" Me: "WTF?! ARE YoU OKAY???" Husband: "yes I am, I treated a guy at the bank who was bleeding."   At this point, my mind is rolling and I just stand in shock. He finishes his shower. I go grab our neighbor so she can hear the story and so he doesn't have to repeat himself.   He was just getting off of shift when he noticed a guy in the parking lot he was guarding wearing a red shirt; he looks away for a second and when he looks at the guy again his shirt is more red.   Husband go to guy to see if he is okay, learns he has been stabbed. Husband tells the guy don't move; runs to his car to grab his med kit. get back and starts to help with his wounds. By sheer luck, there was a nurse in the area who noticed the commotion and stopped her errands to help too.   The victim was already on the phone with police while husband and nurse are applying gauze, pressure, and bandages.   Police and EMTs arrive and take over.   The guy was still alive when husband left. As husband was leaving to go home, he got stopped due a police stand off with the suspect less than 1 block from our home. They had blocked off the road and had traffic at a stand still.
0	Former customer service representative that used to ask some of my superiors the same question. It is a mixture of things but ultimately it is a numbers game. If you are a large company that stands to make 1-2% more by including a scripted line that your customer service representatives have to say. Then you are going to do it. Most people calling in don't have any intention on changing their plan. For instance they could have a deal where you pay $1 for a year of service, but you would never get to take advantage of this offer because you assumed that any offer that they had would no appeal to you. By mandating a scripted offer into the customer service representatives call flow a percentage of people will ultimately take advantage of the offer achieving the end goal and making the sales pitch mandatory for the future. Retention costs are built into the forecasted impact of these lines and if it doesn't make financial sense then the company wouldn't do it.
1	In my opinion by far the biggest nerf is removal of the CDR. It would still be a very good item even if you had to do 5% more damage to your target from other sources.   To be honest I think a DFG nerf has been long overdue, but complete removal of CDR means manaless casters lost (iirc) their only way of getting CDR without buying mana or giving up mag pen on boots. My poor poor Mordekaiser....   Also no amount of nerfing the item (except to the point that no one buys it at all) is going to get people to use it on tanks when they could burst carries instead.
1	I really dislike this. In fact, I hate this. I don't play ranked anymore and this change makes it seem like people will just troll in normals because nobody can see it and their reply will just be "Its just a normal" from the Rammus who builds 6 zeals.   Riot, stop forcing people to play Ranked. It's not for everyone and this just seems like another way of forcing people to just play ranked or you're matches don't count. I do not feel like stressing out over a video game and if this causes me too much stress than I won't enjoy this game anymore.
0	Once the shooter picked up those guns and drove to the school the only thing that was going to stop him was deadly force.  That much I think we can all agree on, yes?  If the elementary school had had a secured entrance (I believe it did actually but he still gained entry) with a metal detector and an armed guard this might have been avoided.  Yes it sucks, no one wants to drop their kids off at a school that looks like a fortress but aren't people willing to put up with that for peace of mind?  I think yes, and I personally would have zero problem with it.  I would actually feel much assured doing so.   As an example: I don't know what the courts are like in your country but over here getting into a court house, as simple as a traffic court, is comparable to boarding an airliner post 911.  And they were like that looong before 911.  Why?  People like shooting up courtrooms.  Used to happen all the time.  My dad was a judge and he showed me one time that the high bench they sit behind is actually a concrete reinforced barrier that will withstand gunfire.  If the shit hits the fan the judge will duck under it, not run for the door.  When was the last time you heard about someone shooting up a court room?   I'm just trying to be practical here and discussing solutions that have a proven track record  in the US .  Gun control, and banning undesirable  elements  (re: drugs, alcohol, abortion, etc) has a 100% failure rate  in the US .  In case you hadn't heard, or I haven't already mentioned, Connecticut has some of the most restrictive gun laws in the US.   Any number of the teachers, administrators, hell the janitors could have been carrying a gun and ended the violence quickly yesterday morning.  At the very least they could have lowered the casualties.   I'm actually a bit irked that no one, at least nothing that has been reported, even tried to tackle the gunman and buy time for the kids to escape.  I'd like to think I would have.  All accounts I've heard so far most of the adults were cowering.  At least some were helping evacuate the kids and what not.  Granted I have very little information to go on but the fact the casualties were so high kind of points that way I think.  I reserve judgment on that for now.
0	Everyone was outraged. Just like they are outraged about the grandfather who was just murdered in a no knock raid. I think everyone who has zoomed out of each specific instance of violence against citizens, you see a huge tapestry of carnage and broken lives that should make any sensible person outraged. Mike Brown's murder came pretty close together with Travon Martin's murder and  Eric Holder's murder, which made people extremely conscious of racially motivated violence and the justice system's unwillingness to do it's job in cases where either people of color are killed or police are doing the killing. The thing that the internet is making us conscious of is a Venn diagram of injustices that don't all fit in the exact same category, but are connected by the fact that they seem officially sanctioned by the government even though these acts are illegal and the means used to defend them are unconstitutional.
1	I posted a post like this below like 2 months ago with similar ideas, I thought I could share it.   >Hi guys, I have some idea that might make 5v5 team more competitive and create a "tournament-environment" that everyone can enjoy at home, at a friend's house, at a club or simply just want to have fun with your team and friends. Below I will try my best to explain my idea about the mini tournament   > MATCH MAKING  : So it's like a 16-32 teams mini tournament. Your team will pay a fee of around 50RP or 1000IP a member (250RP or 5000 IP in total). After your team pay the fee to enter to competition (If you paid IP you will match with teams that also paid in IP or if you paid in RP you will be in an RP tournament), you will wait in a queue to find other teams (base on your league and division your team in). After there are enough teams to create a tournament, there will be a notification to click on to show you the bracket or table that show you what team you are playing against.(If you cancel the matchmaking queue before it pop, the fee will be refund). Your team will then continue to the game, may be bo3 or just bo2. Winning team goes on and losing team will be eliminate from that particular mini tournament.   > RULES : Dodger in the first elimination round will be replace with a random team that's in queue. After the second round, the dodger will be count as forfeit. There will be pause and stuff.   > AWARDS : If you got eliminated from the tournament before the tournament with no ranking from 1-4, you will receive no price and lose the fee you paid. Prices will be given to every member that played the tournament. I don't know about how the award system going to be but here are some examples that I think of:   >   RP Tournament : >   First place  will receive a free pick of a <975RP skin in the store or 800RP and 100LP (so it will be your team's next promotion-too bad if ur team is 99LP-  or gain pts in challenger)     Second place  will receive a free pick of a <520RP skin in the store (on sale counts) or 450RP and 50LP   Third place  100RP plus 25LP for the team.      >*  IP Tournament :     First place  will receive a pick of any champion in the store that not own or 6000IP and 25LP for team   Second place  will receive a pick of any champion <6299 IP or 4000IP    Third place  2500IP      > ACHIEVEMENTS : So team that got ranking will receive Trophies in their tournament that they can brag about and after reaching a certain trophies or achievement points, you can unlock some badass icon that show on your profile or a special badge under or next to your name.   >Please feel free and help me with more ideas on this ! :)   >What do you guys think ?   >
0	Its really easy, vote for the person not the party.  Even if you are 100% convinced beyond all reason that the Republican party is shitting liquid  malevolence all over the  face of society and the Democratic party is literally led by saints and super humans who are beyond benevolent...   At the end of the day the Democratic candidate can be a major fuck up, and the Republican candidate can be a good person even if party wise you disagree with them.   Now if you are a single issue voter and all you care about is marijuana legalization, gay rights, tax code changes, nature conservation, gun laws, or whatever else then you have a pretty clear cut politician to support.  Which in smaller politics (aka state level and lower) often times you will find Democrats fronting conservation efforts (traditionally a rep thing) and you will find Republicans pushing for gun laws (traditionally a dem thing).   My governor (and his competing candidates) don't really have a damn thing to do with with most of the DC bullshit big name people.  Maybe they have future dreams of going national and maybe they don't, but at the core level the policy of Bush or Obama reps or dems is not 100% mirrored within state level politics/branch parties.
1	I have a theory about banning in ranked solo queue, can someone confirm my theory or explain why it's wrong? My theory is this: if a champion has a win rate 50% or below for your tier, banning that champ will actually hurt your chances of winning. Take Shen for instance, with a Bronze win rate that ranges from 45 to 48 percent. Even though your less enlightened teammates will say "shen op gg we lost", giving your opponent Shen will actually increase your chances of winning, since the team that plays against Shen wins more than 50 percent of the time. Janna and Rammus are better bans than Thresh or Shen, unless you are banning out a counterpick of course.
1	people are just total sheep when it comes to champions...they somehow assume everything that is not FotM is bad. Sejuani is totally viable and a very solid pick.   I still can't understand how LoL players are so stupid when it comes to champions: e.g. Cassio was considered UP for 1.5 years and you had to argue with your team when you wanted to pick her...then all of a sudden she becomes OP only because some pro showed people her strength. Seems like 95% of the playerbase (even a lot of the "pro" players) fail at making unbiased analysis of champion skills and their viability depending on team setups etc.
0	This is probably not as bad as me. I was in Paris once for a 15 hour layover and decided to visit Versailles for a few hours. When I tried to take the Metro back to the airport, they had some kind of hour long delay. I had only given myself an hour leeway, so I was going to miss my flight back to New York if I didn't get to the airport in time. So I decided to go outside and fetch a taxi. After about a dozen or so taxis (both empty and full) ignored me, I remembered that I had Uber on my phone. But Uber requires that you turn on data roaming. I didn't want to miss my flight so I decided to eat the few dollars of data roaming that Uber would cause. I also downloaded all my emails with the airport wifi beforehand, so I didn't think it was going to be so bad. Once I turned on the data roaming I realized that I made a huge mistake. Someone had been texting me dozens of pictures at 1-3 mb each via iMessage while I was at Versailles. Once I turned on the data, it grabbed about 50mb worth of pictures. You might think that that's nothing. But data roaming fees are: $.0195/KB ($19.96/MB). The Metro also started moving again a minute after I turned on data roaming.
1	I understand that you feel the need to correct misinformation presented in the community, but comments on a non-Riot-owned discussion board is not always the correct medium, especially in a case like this. As demonstrated with the earlier post, in heavily opinionated cases like this, all these informal comments do is incite witch hunts, hate, bullying, and harassment. There is absolutely no reason a formal post on Riot's official boards can be used to address potentially volatile topics such as this instead of Rioters' personal Reddit accounts.  It is not like it would not hit the front page of reddit instantly and the corrections themselves will gain greater readership instead of hoping that some of the community happens to read all of your posts on the topic.   There is a difference between having a Rioter respond to a post to discuss aspects about the game itself, or player created content, but discussions that pertain to player cases especially those involving youth have no place on Reddit. It is not like a post by a Rioter has no influence on the upvoted/accepted community consensus on emotionally charged topics.  If we use Incarnation as an example we could look at two  cases:   1) Article claims Incarnation cleared for 2015 season.   Rioter Response: "Incarnation will not be unbanned for the 2015 season."   Upvoted Community Response: "I'm glad that jerk is still banned what he did was unforgivable."   2) Article claims Incarnation ineligible for 2015 season.   Rioter Response: "We have completed our review process of incarnation's ban and have decided he will be eligible for professional play in the 2015 season."   Upvoted Community Response: "He is such a skilled player, it is great to see he's reformed and look forward to seeing him represent our community on the rift."   What is the difference between posting these comments in a formal post and as a comment on Reddit? If you post a comment on Reddit, you are facilitating the discussion on a medium for which you have zero control.  If the discussion takes place on a medium that you own, not only can there be better control over the types of conversations that take place there (differing opinions vs "he should kill himself"), but Red posts can be easily found regardless of how buried  they may be in a sea of responses. It is irresponsible to conduct these types of discussions on a third party board. This situation deals with a specific person.  The issue is big enough that the community knows and cares about it. You address the error and any misconceptions in a clear and formal post and if you feel the need to, link to said post as a reply. The point is that the discussion starts there.   Look back at the response from the "XJ9 back" thread. In no right world is that the correct place to make that type of announcement that deals with a specific targetable person or team. This isn't a "Sorry guys we made a mistake in the patch notes." You would not have announced the C9T bans in a comment on here. Not because they're pro players, but because you want better control over your message when it's a sensitive topic that deals with specific individuals.
1	The 10000 RP is received only when you do direct deposit a preloaded credit card.   This means that you need a job that has a regular enough salary that they use the direct deposit system.   Granted if you are on good terms with whoever does the payroll for you, you could potentially transfer it after one week, but the process takes time and you still have a month/week/however you get paid worth of salary on that credit card, and it costs a fee to transfer it to another account.   This essentially means that this card becomes your default credit card, and not one of those department store credit card that you just sign up to get the 15% discount.   If you are doing direct deposit to a credit card you can get some seriously good benefits since all credit card companies know that this card will get a lot of use. Banks make you advantage members, Discover gives bonus cash back, and I think Chase gives you bonus miles.   Finally, you actually need a decent enough credit score to get approved for this card, so that excludes a lot of people.
1	ok, so those are some very good questions and there are some things you can do as heimerdinger to overcome them.  Firstly, if you split jungle aggro with your turrets effectively, then its easy to go machete, 2 pots, and a ward.  I like to use that early ward to give me vision around my red and prevent counterjungling there.  If I communicate with my bot or top lane I can generally keep vision around my jungle early with that ward to safely get my red buff.   Optimally, I go for a smiteless blue and try to grab red right away, safely because of ward positioning.  When it comes to ganking, he really cant reliably gank before level 4 unless you have a laner with cc or other circumstances I won't get into.  I duo queue with someone that usually plays mid or top so we plan it out that way, as heimerdinger can really drop a surprising amount of damage if he can close with the enemy, and if your laner has some cc it gets a lot easier to hit your grenade.
0	I'm a server. I'm American. What I'm about to say is for Americans or those eating at a restaurant in the United States.   As far as wages go, I get paid around $3 an hour. Everything else comes from tips. As far as I know, the restaurant makes up for it if I'm not making minimum wage but I've been fortunate enough to not have that problem.   The standard of tipping is 18%. At the restaurant I work at, and others, whenever I take care of large parties (7 or more), we'll add 18% gratuity to the check. We do that because that is the considered standard. If you think you're giving a good tip at 15%, you're not.   This is the bottom line, if you can't afford the system, don't join. It's our choice to become a server, that's correct, but just how nobody asked us to become a server, nobody asked you to go to a restaurant where you couldn't afford it or don't agree with it. Being able to afford to eat out isn't just the price of the food, it's the price of the food along with the price of the service.
0	Not entirely sure I understand your point. LGBT or LGBTQ is a useful term to describe a community of people whose sexual or gender identity contrasts with the hetero one society traditionally promotes. Its a helpful term to describe a broad group, who stand together often because of a shared concern of living in countries which have historically (and still currently) treat them poorly for how they identify. They are a union of sexual minorities.   Are you suggesting that the acronyms exclusion of heterosexuality (which would serve no purpose) somehow undermines what the rainbow flag is supposed to represent? If so, I don't think I agree. They pertain to two different things. Its a little like suggesting that the US flag isn't inclusive of all states because Texans don't label New Yorkers as Southerners.
1	And just like that your retarded for some reason you let someone on the Internet get to you. Looks like I won and you've lost again. The sooner you realize a troll is a troll the further you will get on the net... When will you ever learn.   Nobody is forcing you to react when you react you give people what they want and you just gave me what I want your no better than the media that hypes up the perpetrator of a heinous crime.
0	I would ask how you would define the limits of intelligence? Do they stem purely from the idea of rational thought and reasoning? Dogs are capable of rational thought and reasoning. Why, the other day, I saw a dog problem solve when he discovered how to get a half-opened door fully opened and enter the house. Or shall you define intelligence by the ability to assess a situation? I'm fairly certain you generally mean to go with an idea of common sense within a being and, to put it bluntly, cumulative knowledge. Cumulative knowledge is how a being stores and then uses information. If you mean to say that the majority of Christian people are incapable of pursuing cumulative knowledge and the reasoning required to use this knowledge in any given situation, perhaps you are correct. But then, that observation would be noted of most every population statistics. It is a widely believed mantra of the internet and of cultures; people are dumb. Here on reddit, we see massive monuments to the stupidity of the average being. The crux of your argument is that the majority of the Atheists have a different statistic, one in which displays a superior percentage of the population as "smarter" than the rest.   Now that the problem has been assessed, allow us to test the validity of it. Let us not start by looking at the Atheist side of it, but let us look at the Christian population. Look at some of the leaders of their respective movements. Apologists, of which there are a surplus, are people who study culture and religion in order to make arguments for/against certain principles of religion. These would be your "scholars" of the "christian" culture as a people within your statistic. In a test of intelligence, they would rank high on the lists with their analysis, reasoning, and fluency skills. Next, let us look at preachers and pastors. Most of which show a degree of higher intelligence by rising to leadership positions and being able to analyze and create their messages. Most show some degrees of wealth, which testifies for their knowledge and problem solving skills. Obviously, they would likely reach higher on the lists of intelligence, but likely would be lower than the dedicated scholars. Then you have the common believer. These are the crux of your argument. Allow me to return to these people.   On the Atheist side of the spectrum, let us look at the scholars and scientists first as well, the political activists and leaders of the Atheism in general. They are the intellectual equality ( perhaps superior, in some peoples minds ) of the apologists, professors, and preachers of the Christian religion, and would arguably show up on the upper tiers as well. Then you have your common Atheist. The thing they share in common with these paragons of Atheism ( just as the thing that the common Christian shares in common with the paragons of Christianity ) is common belief in Atheism. The crux of your argument lies with these lower tiers. The commoners.   However, we must look in depth at what is happening. When you go to a church, you look around, and what do you see? some people will say "christians" but the reality is that you see Steel workers. You see miners. You see electricians. Movers. Politicians. Teachers. Professors. People in a society who are bonded together at that moment under the common belief of "christianity" and thus following their religious practices, making them religious people. However, these people don't all want to be a part of the worship team or do in depth study of the bible and be pastors or apologists. They are content with allowing the paragons to do that and remaining the common christian. They go home and they do their jobs. It is not the topic of religion which decides how smart or dumb they are, their cumulative knowledge or their problem solving skills. They prefer, generally, to use these skills on their jobs and the like. And for many of those people, they rise high, or they fall low, just as any common people do. They use those skills for religion when it calls, for instance, when confronted by people such as yourself, who would pry and question them directly, as opposed to seeking out a paragon or someone whose specialty it was to study the answers or non-answers to the questions asked.   Conversely, if you were to find a cluster of atheists ( since they don't have church meetings, we'll just say they all happen to be together ) what would you see there? Would you see only scientists? Only doctors and dentists? Or do you perhaps think that cooks, teachers, steel workers, and electricians may be in this group as well? These people, with their respective jobs and positions, what makes them inherently more adept at any given time that they can achieve more cumulative knowledge, use problem solving skills, or make higher wages than a christian? The only difference between the common christian and a common atheist is 1.) attitude, 2.) code, and 3.) the distinction between belief, which largely affects the first two. ( so I suppose I could have left those out. )   You'll find that as the population of Atheists rises, the intelligence of the society as a whole will not. Because that core belief is not what creates intelligence and reasoning. There are thousands of atheists who are just as smart of stupid as people of religion. I know many. The common Atheist has no distinction from the common religious person, because they are both just people. Now, what can be taken into account is the amount of schooling received and other such things, which, if we are under the assumption that all of these religious and atheist people are living in the same country ( we'll say America or Europe, as a citizen of America and most of the European countries can generally be of any religious or counter-religious practice they desire. ) would be equal opportunity.   In that way, I would say, no. Atheists are not smarter than religious people.
0	oh man, so this is totally me too but i believe i have good reason.   one time  when i was about 12 or 13 I was at target with my mom and on of my buddies(who was black which may or may not have played a part in the coming story..), as we pass through the security gate it instantly goes off and my mom glares at me. My buddy and I have absolutely nothing, only my mom is carrying bags. 3 security or loss-prevention staff come running over and start going through my moms bags points at my friend and I and tells us to turn out our pockets ect ect. 15mins go by and we're still standing there. They tell us to go-to their office so they can more thoroughly search.. another 25-30mins go by.. they've searched my moms purse.. patted us down.. told us to take off our shoes.. everything.. then it happens.   On the underside of my buddies shoe is a tag that must have stuck as we we're walking the aisles.
1	Like the guy who replied said, E auto does still work, but you have to A click the champion you can't just do it in the air anymore. Also, for builds I personally thing tear + roa is pretty shit and gives you a weak ass early-mid game and the mana isn't too efficient because just one of them gives you all you need (0.25 health per mana is overrated just buy health if want.) Tear into rylais is always strongest for me, you don't NEED boots early because if you really want to go agressive or run away ghost will give way more then the enemys movespeed and move quints should keep you more mobile for quite a while into the laning phase. Singed is best vs AD comps as the only good MR items for singed are merc treads and maybe Banshees, if singed is versus ad top and jungle I like to go thornmail especially if its full ad, if its more mixed randuins is an ok 3rd major item. Assuming you get fed, I always like to skip out on resistances as damage will help you more in 2v1 scenario so I normally get haunting guise. Honestly the best item versus dual resistances is a fully stacked seraphs especially if you are ahead, singed's mid games is really strong and if you have a archangels rylai you are super strong.
1	I understand what you're getting at 100% and I guess in a way I agree. But - take it from someone who WAS in Elo hell for a long time - sometimes you DO need to carry yourself up a little to even have a relevant competitive experience.   Most of the time at low Elo no matter what role you play you're not playing against any skilled opponent so even if you attempt to practice jungling or supporting you won't have relevant experiences because your team won't play well enough. If you try to support a team that overextends - that experience will not prepare you for a team that knows what it's doing; if you try to jungle and your laners don't know how to act during a gank that too will give you unreasonable expectations of how a gank works.   "Carrying" yourself out of Elo hell is IMHO perfectly fine so long as it is done only to the point that you start getting reasonably skilled teammates AND opponents so that REAL learning can begin.
0	Just think for a few seconds.   This post is on the front page.  To get on the front page a post must accrue a high number of upvotes.  To get upvotes a post has to be seen, digested, then judged by a redditor.   You might notice that many people (over 4000) have viewed this post and furthermore one might observe that 700+ of those people have left comments.   Equiped with this knowledge and the fact that comments are governed by the same upvote/downvote system as posts, we recognize that most of the comments you see are what have been filtered by the same audience that deigned to view and assess this post.   Given the facts that the OP dumped a girl and left her 45 minutes away from home, and the appraisers of this post found this acceptable or even humorous (given the post has a positive number of upvotes), we can come to the realization that White Knights and Feminazis would be a minority in the viewers.   If we note that the post was 5 hours old by the time that you  thoroughly  browsed the comment section we could come to the conclusion that if there were White Knights and Feminazis, they would quite likely be buried under comments that the audience of this post found more appealing.   If you would have given it a few seconds thought before posting you wouldn't have been downvoted and I wouldn't have wasted 5 minutes of my life explaining how to use deductive reasoning.
1	You're right.. I didn't read all the way down haha
1	The reason we can relate with Jinx so well is everyone possesses an id, the unorganized part of the human psyche (the only part present at birth) which drives our wants, impulses, as well as the aggressive, and sexual drive.   Freud described it as such. "It is the dark, inaccessible part of our personality, what little we know of it we have learned from our study of the Dreamwork and of the construction of neurotic symptoms, and most of that is of a negative character and can be described only as a contrast to the ego. We approach the id with analogies: we call it a chaos, a cauldron full of seething excitations.... It is filled with energy reaching it from the instincts, but it has no organization, produces no collective will, but only a striving to bring about the satisfaction of the instinctual needs subject to the observance of the pleasure principle."   As a contrast to the ego, or the "mediator between the Id and reality" I feel a lot of people can really relate to the pleasure Jinx finds in chaos and destruction, as violence is a basic human survival instinct.
1	The problem with LCS is that is all run by riot. This is both a blessing and a curse. The blessing comes from the fact that it makes esports, which is mostly unstable, stable. So I won't focus too much on that.   You see in all professional sports every team is an organization in itself with the sport being separate. Look at football you have the owner, gms, managers for specific aspects and coaches. Outside of the owner things start to get spread out. However, that's okay because the owner, ya know, owns the team (lol) so he has an invested interest in keeping things alive and what's best for the team.   With Riot running everything you don't have this hierarchy of control and no one really has an invested interest in the future or things growing. LCS is still  new and it has it's flaws. What Riot needs to do is turn this into an established sport as quickly as it can. They have taken the first step with LCS. Next they need to focus on teams and really switching from where Riot no longer pays their salaries.   Even if riot wants to continue to pay then insert salary caps, and contracts. These would makes things so much more organized and harder for players to be taken advantage off. Plus it makes for a good free market for players, such as yourself Mega.   Riot also needs to not have a system where teams drop from the LCS. You can't have organizations and expect your franchise to grow outside of what Riot puts out if they do this. They are creating a fanbase for those teams. They need to strengthen and expand (I.E. new teams and expanding lcs) if they want to grow as a sport.
0	Damn strait option bear.  I'm guessing we should use our voices and down votes. When I see some bullshit cutsy meme make the front page because everyone upvote sit though I feel like the people have spoken.  I don't know why anyone would shop at Walmart or GameStop EVER, yet people on this site do.  Stupid and unthinking is rampant and seriously become a prevalent part of this site as well.  If you don't like something don't support it for any reason and help other people realize they should also not support it... But they will inevitably upvote cute little kids on Halloween. Bull. Shit.  Add some CONTENT!  Post in the appropriate SUBREDDIT!  /r/Halloween exists for a reason.  There are so many ways to pick apart what I just said and I don't care, I was high up on a stack of soap boxes :)
0	well, I will if you really want me to, but I have no beef with you. I do believe in God, but I am married to an atheist (we've been together 10 years), I really don't agree with recreational drug use (or people who get crazy drunk for the hell of it on a frequent basis, as everyone is entitled to a few, my life sucks ass and I want to forget moments). And while I love animals and have 2 kitties I don't expect other people to love them as I do. I also can't stand Obama. So we can break into fistie cuffs, but I would rather just get along, lol.
1	Resident asshole here   If you ever saw my posts, you would usually see me trolling, being sarcastic, or a douchebag. But one side of me that not a lot of people know about, is that sometimes I do feel emotionless, depressed, empty, sad, lonely, and in general it leads to me viewing suicide as a smart decision. But of course, I do come to my senses.  There are some who don't, though.  People who tell others to kill themselves are just the lowest of the fucking low, who in my eyes lost their license to call themselves part of the human society.
0	Was it like a special family recipe or just something she'd been meaning to eat before she passed? Cos if it's the first one then you could always make more as part of a tradition in her memory instead of hanging onto that one bowl.   Actually you could still make some even if the second situation is true, doesn't matter what you do, long as it means something to you. Food for thought.
0	Why is this downvoted? I was going to say the exact same thing; police have no obligation to protect you, they are there to protect  the law .   Recent example:   "While plaintiffs pointed to the officers’ close proximity to the attack and their perceived ability to prevent it,  proximity does not create a special relationship  (see id.). Mr. Lozito conceded that he had no communication or contact with the police officers before the attack took place. The first prong of the  Cuffy  elements was not met here. No direct promises of protection were made to Mr. Lozito nor were there direct actions taken to protect Mr. Lozito prior to the attack.  Therefore, a special duty did not exist.  "
1	I don't think people really realize what style adc Lucian is meant to be. Mobility, rotation, objective control. He works great on teams that benefit from moving through the jungle and utilizing high mobility. Think 'pick comp.'   His level 11 his ult does MASSIVE damage to dragon. Lucian and a jungler can basically drop dragon in about 15 seconds with his ult.   His ult is NOT meant to be a nuke, or a massive damage spike in teamfights. In fact, Lucian isn't that great in 5v5 team fights. I've had my best success in pick comps. If you force Lucian to fight 5v5, you really limit his damage output. His W, E and R all work great for catching someone out and gunning them down. He is also a lane bully when you utilize his passive to full potential and these mana regen buffs are really going to help him stay in lane and bully longer as well as farm up to scale in to the mid game smoother.
0	According to Zimmerman, He saw Martin at the northwest corner of the neighborhood. It's likely Martin cut through the bushes there because he didn't have a keycard for the front gate because he was just a visitor. Zimmerman passed him in his car and parked at the clubhouse about 150ft down the road to place the call.   While on the phone, Martin passes Zimmerman as he's sitting at the clubhouse. Zimmerman pulls out of the clubhouse and drives about 125ft down Twin Trees and parks when he sees Martin walk down the North-South breezeway between the townhomes. At this point, He gets out of his car and follows Martin. According to Zimmerman, when he gets to the intersection he saw Martin head down the operator tells him he doesn't need to follow. Now, According to Zimmerman, he continues straight instead of going down the breezeway after Martin. His explanation is that he's looking for a house number on Retreat View Cir. When he reaches Retreat View, He decides to go back the way he came back to his truck. He ends the phone call and that's the last thing we have on record.
1	You're pretty late realizing this.  It happens every season.  The issues with all the QQs and stuff is that they think they can not care early season and suddenly want gold and get it. You need to always play like it's end season. Everyone waits till the end it its just too late.
0	Care to elaborate? Cultural influence has to do with how many the country's culture affects. In  direct  influence (i.e. people living in that country) China is way beyond USA's influence. USA's population is (according to [wiki]( is a mere 23% of China's population [source]( Sure, you could try to measure  indirect  influence and taking into account that the western world is greatly influenced by USA's massmedia format but then you'd also have to measure China's sphere of influence, which the dominant one around Asia. Oh and Asia is by the way the leading continent in population.   Economic influence is just as hard to measure, however USA's GDP is ranked nr.1 and China's nr.2 as of this moment, making USA the "winner" of this facet. However comparing the economy between superpowers such as these is naive at best seeing as they're entwined to the point that one cannot survive without the other (try finding something in the room you're in that says "made in china and you'll realize the point I'm trying to make).   Political influence on the other hand is an interesting topic. First and foremost the governments differ greatly. China is, as far as I know, a more totalitarian state which isn't afraid of using force to subvert their population. USA doesn't seem to be all too afraid of doing the same thing but they've got a lot more transparency than China and are therefore restricted in what they can and can't do (take Wikileaks or Watergate as an example). This part of political influence is once again more or less  direct  influence. The  indirect  influence is nigh impossible to measure or quantify so I'll stay away from that subject but it all seems to come down to that China doesn't have the same rational fear of it's population as USA and therefore isn't as restricted.
0	OP here. For everyone bitching about why I left it in my car, they were in an unmarked black book bag on the floor underneath the dash underneath a jacket. And I left them in there while I went into a store that doesn't allow backpacks, and this happened while I was parked in one of the nicest areas of DC during broad daylight.
0	No Matter What, Don't Try to be "Nice"   Year and a half a go, I had some young girl who had gotten her license like a month before run a red light (she was following someone and they sped thru the yellow) and I couldn't fully avoid her. She paused a moment and then kept driving. I had chase after her (losing all my would-be witnesses) and catch her at a stop sign, yelling "Pull the FUCK over!" to break her out of her shock.   She gave me her info, but begged me to let her take care of it without involving her insurance and her mom. I went to get an estimate and when I told her via text, she then tells her mom. Only, she lies and says I ran the light (she doesn't have a job, gets money from the state). She says her mom doesn't think she should pay anything and I realize I'm kinda fucked - because she ran it is now my word vs hers. Then, the light bulb went off in my head - there are 2 gas stations at the intersection, maybe one has video of the accident.   I go to the first closest to the corner it happened at and my heart sinks - seems the idiot who came in that day forgot to put in fresh discs to record on. But when I go to the other one I am saved: yep, on their security cams you can see the light change, everyone next to me begin to move and then her car run the light. I call the mom and I let her start defending her kid before I drop the bombshell: "did she tell you there is video of the accident?"   Yeah, her attitude changed instantly and from then on she couldn't be nicer to me. Wish her daughter got the memo, because every step was a pain in the balls. Every time her whining about how this was costing her everything she had for 3 months. Worse, I had worked it out to only repair the worst of the damage at a shop her mom's company used for their own vehicles so it wouldn't cost as much AND I had to pay for the new headlight needed up front because while the repair guy didn't mind doing the paint/labor, he didn't want to be out of pocket real money.   The capper: she could have been arrested for fleeing (I had her plate# before chasing her down) and repair job wasn't that great.
0	hahah I am doing it in javascript for a few reasons.   1) I want to learn javascript. As it is, I know little to nothing about web stuff (despite almost having a CS degree)   2) I would like my video game that I'm working on to eventually be played on a browser.   3) I need something that I can easily e mail to potential bosses to show them what I've done outside of school.   I actually wrote a lot of my game in python and pygame. But I'll be damned if I know which version of python OR pygame I used. So I'm starting over again, but in JavaScript.   Also..yeah. I might have a death wish. Is there a decent debugger for JavaScript? I need to walk through my code one step at a time because I'm having the WEIRDEST fucking error. as time passes, the distance that my character moves by increases. So initially my character will just move by 1 or so (as I tried to program it to do) but after a while, if you simply wait long enough, try to go in any direction, and he'll move by a few hundred or 1000...whatever. pixels I guess?
1	Mechanical skill can be practiced literally everywhere, be it ARAM or Bots.  Actually understanding the game on the Rift, any person can develop reflex and precision, as both are needed in this game, but you won't learn a thing about predicting the movement of your enemy in the lane, the jungling path of the opposing jungler, the ammount of aggresion you can take at certain times.   ARAMs do give you champion knowledge and mechanics, but claiming they give you a scenario of every 5v5 SR game happening in the middle lane without is straight-up dumb.   And if someone is to play ARAMs only, while neglecting their laning phase expierence then he will a poor time anywhere higher than Plat V-IV, since he will be simply abused by people who punish a laid-back early game.

1	BT and IE are 3500 and 3800 respectively.   Atma's was only 2300. Even removing the Avarice Blade, throwing in a Giant's Belt, increasing the overall price to match, you have an item that gives:     400-500 health   40-50 armour   1.5% of max health as AD) (assuming 5-5.5k health, that's 75-82 AD -  essentially on par with the aforementioned luxury AD items )      ... for less than a Sunfire Cape.   To make it balanced at the target demographic (champions that build full tank and want to blow things up harder), the item would have to cost at least 3k in my eye, putting it well beyond budget range.   The item would be far and away game breaking if it cost what it used to, and that's not a good thing. Think Vi, Sion, and other AD tanks are already obnoxious? Give them a free IE's worth of AD on top of a decent defensive item. There's no sacrifice. Cinderhulk and Atma's, in combination with any single one of Banshee's, Warmog's, or Randuin's would allow a midgame bruiser, on top of their 3000+ health and Cinderhulk passive and good defences, almost a free BF Sword.
0	Don't take her advice.   Just use common sense. Having a three texts a day rule is fucking stupid.   Take care when your texting a girl to make sure you come across as not needy and no overly attached, but still interested and you're fine.  This means that if she's waiting 30 min to respond to all your texts you best not be responding immediately to ALL of hers, though you should to one after you've delayed a few just to show that you really aren't planning the delays, but living your busy life and they are just happening (even though you really are planning them).   Don't monitor it at all and you will always fuck it up, every time, cuz as a guy you are usually going to be much more into her at the start than she into you. Allowing your true emotions to manifest too quickly will always fuck the situation over. Always.   Note: once she's your girlfriend the rule changes. Being nonneedy is still important, but her feeling like she is important to you and valued and loved is more important and it's why the girl above me dumped her bf for his dumbass 3 text rule. (also she did it because his patten was too obvious and the pattern itself, though designed to make him look smooth actually showed her how nervous he truly was. And it killed the attraction.)
0	I think I can answer that as I was in the same situation as your friend until 2011. Basically, a lot of govs followed [WCAG 1 AAA]( which was created back in 1999 when JS and the web in general wasn't very user friendly and had very restrictive accessibility standards.   Fast forward 10 years later, the web is completely different and the rules are out of date. Screen readers for people with disabilities are better and there is no need for all these rules.   Most place now follow  WCAG 2 .
0	Well...same here, except I did well in school, scored high on my ACTs, was involved in a lot of extra-curricular activities in high school...anyways, I had full rides to a few schools, ended up going to a decent one and spent more on car insurance than tuition.
0	Oh my god this sub.   Going online to berate and mock your parents whom you speculate may be suffering from a personality disorder/fairly serious mental illness for some bizarre self affirmation or weird ego massage from your peers is ironically extremely narcissistic behaviour. I wonder how well the sub deals with criticism, seeing as rejection or difference of opinions tends to anger those with narcissistic tendencies.   Edit: judging by the tirade of downvotes, not well it would seem!   Edit 2: I won't be deleting this comment to preserve the integrity of the conversation but I urge people to read the insightful arguments made by  everyone below, in particular those of bigangrydinosaur. It's very rare for a stranger online to profoundly change someone's opinion but I can honestly say that this person has achieved just that. I am deeply sorry for any offence caused and I can honestly say that I now see this sub as something far more positive than what I had given it credit for.
1	You know what sucks is that the majority of times I play with redditors I feel so pressured to play perfectly. I know that's my own problem, but I remember 2 particular games where in the first game, one of the redditors said in mumble "Guys, how does it feel to have a girl have a better k/d ratio than us" (I'm a girl) and at first I thought it was just a joke but he said something similar later on and I think he really meant it.   I'm usually not sensitive about the whole "haha gamer girls lololol" but I don't want to have to worry about that when I'm just trying to play with fellow redditors.   In the 2nd game, I was having a lot of trouble getting turretdove like crazy up top and although I kept asking if I could get some help, they just said "you better step your game up", or "I blame this loss on you".   Sorry, had to let that out.   Feels bad man.
0	As a rule, no.  This was asked somewhere else on reddit... can't remember for the life of me, something about Japanese people being inbred or something.  But if you're Christian or have Christian ancestry, essentially 2nd cousins are considered taboo, were too close, and are only granted by Church authority historically under special or case by case circumstances.
0	I got to see around 30 meteors last night.  It was pretty magical.  I got my parents to sit outside and watch with me.  My mom was full of joy, like she had never seen anything like it.  We saw two in particular that were devastatingly beautiful.  One the traveled a quarter of the sky, fairly large, looked a lot like a sparkling firework.  The other one traveled the entire distance of the sky before disappearing.  It was humongous, it had two tails burning  off of it.  One of the most beautiful things I've ever seen.
0	If you are pursuing just the logic of this statement you are absolutely 100% true. But I think you are missing the point of the morality of this statement. If you are fighting for equality, wouldn't you want establish at least 50% of your own economic security? I think it's a bit immoral to completely rely on another individual for support and think that, that is ok.   Also, look at the double-standard of the situation: A man that works for men's rights, all while having a rich woman support him, undermines his morality.
1	The donations thing is becoming a big deal in the LoL scene.  People are realizing that there's money to be made from the viewers, whether it's intentionally through donations or unintentionally through watching a stream/ads.  The viewers are currently saturated with the touts that are both pros and non-pros alike.   The pros want donations to fund their trips abroad, but they offer what the LoL community sees as valuable insight into the game (and private lessons).  The visual media people are giving the community something pretty valuable as well (insight into the minds of the players and their reactions outside of the game, top 5 clips), but the community doesn't see that as being enough.   I don't think anyone really minds chipping in for a worthy/good cause (i.e. interesting content, unique interviews, sick fam, etc), but most people are hesitant to donate if they have no idea where this money is going, especially when the product/service being provided doesn't hit beyond that threshold of, "dang, I can't do that".  When a pro goes into his/her insight about why they bought a certain item or picked a certain champ, there's something to be gained from that that is useful and unknown to the viewer before hand.  When a player drinks on a skype call for an hour or two and ad libs hilarious comments, well, I guess that's where LoL viewers draw the line from donate worthy or not.   If I give 10 bucks to protatomonster, since he's raising funds for a sick classmate, how do I know where that money is going?  I have no opinion on protatomonster's integrity, other than he's really consistent with his weekly top 5 plays and I enjoy his commentating style/videos.  That's it.  I don't know if he's in high school or college.  The cynic in me wants to say that he'll be forced to skim off the top because people on reddit (and the Internet in general) love giving to causes and he'll get a lot of money.  Maybe if he gets over a grand, he'll spend a few hundred to upgrade his monitor.  And no matter what he says or does, I don't know.  And it isn't his fault or on him to do anything different.
1	Well I think Panth would be a decent counter for these reasons:     He has a ranged harass on a pretty low CD (Q)     He has a stun that he can activate from range (W)     His E is a short DoT       Basically, you can poke at her all day with Q and she can't do much against you. Also, since Panth is pretty bursty (I love QWEQ combo), you can drop her pretty quickly right after a few pokes, at least pre-6. Thus far, the only problem I see is that if you fail to kill her, she can retaliate pretty heavily (if she has enough health or the balls to take you on) or escape relatively easily (stun, run, and E as you toss spears).
1	Simply 'cause you pay so much for stats you do not need
1	Had the same experience, diamond 3 to silver 3. Got back in a week tho since you get like 4 times as much lp as you lose and you also skip divisions.   It sucks but just hang in there and you will get back. You will also have some people flaming you for being silver but just ignore them.
1	I seriously laugh at all those "rumble ults" comments as viktor player.   the freaky ult is easy to cast especially with smart cast,  you press ult and hold it. when you press ult, your ult will be thrown where your god damn mouse is,  Let me ask are you guys blind? can't you see where the fk your mouse is? then you just drag your mouse while still holding the freaky ult down, and then release. You know what?  from the moment you pressed ult.  to the way you drag your mouse, thats how your ult is going to be cast.   Easy Pweasy.
1	The "Kayle: nerfed to death" sentence was some of the biggest BS I have ever read in a reddit thread.Kayle is still viable,for crying out loud it is even played in OGN.If you don't trust your teammates on certain champions just ban them.
0	This.  Someone who just shelled out the ridiculous coin for an engagement ring is going to still have the little details fresh in their head.  The wedding ring?  That's the one they threw in for free after you had to finance the engagement ring.
1	I think You can be right with this e-sport's team "vs" dev team.   E-sport's team have to make great show, create everything for Us so we can feel like we are watching traditional sport's event and everything must be done in specific time to meet deadline. There is no "Oh we can just change AP ratio from 0.3 to 0.4 for now, the whole rework will be done next year" (yeah I know that I'm simplifying but You get my point).   From other hand dev team can say such things because they are probably not accounted for changes in specific time limits. I can't imagine that they have to change a champion, create a new one etc in like 6 months - if not, They got to face the consequances. There is no real rush.   They know that our community always complain so there is no difference between implementing new modes, features, significant changes very fast instead of just implementing new items once for a season, changing only ratios back and forth.   For now LoL is in dominant position in MOBA scene and they just do everything to secure that position. If DOTA2 for example (I've just started to play it and it's super fun, complex and challenging) is very close to LoL position, Riot will start to make a lot of huge changes just to prevent people from quiting LoL, to keep they entertained, but I think that it will be too late:(
0	I worked take-out at a sit down restaurant before moving to serving and here is my take.   If I have to do a million things for your order like get you multiple sides of ranch(which we don't charge you for) I expect a little bit of a tip. If you heavily modify your order beyond recognition and it comes out correct you better tip because I spent time trying to talk with the kitchen who hate takeout orders and speak little English to make sure it is correct. Next time you try it and you do not tip I will make an effort to not give you silverware or anything free I can.   Also to-go will give you free stuff. Like a drink while you wait if it is not ready, or maybe some extra fries. If you tip and I recognize you I will always make your drinks  free.   If you are a repeat customer you should tip because you will get better service and as much free stuff I can give you according to the rules, which is a good amount. If you are a repeat customer and don't tip you will get sub-par service and get all the way home to only realize your blessed fat ass is missing your free ranch, silverware, and anything else I don't have to do.   If you don't like it realize this is a capitalist country and that in the food service industry if we know you won't tip we won't care about you. That is just the way it works.   Please tip your takeout people they usually are hard working people and are trying to move up in the service industry so they can actually make money.   If you get takeout from a bartender and don't tip you are an asshole who just cost the bartender tip out from their overall sales.   Most of us in the industry are just trying to better ourselves through school so we don't have to deal with people who don't tip anymore. And when we do go out we realize the struggle of those that do work it. To-go is seen as a stepping stool to serving for a lot of people.

In short form:  about 4 years ago a law called the ACA (affordable care act) was passed, it was later ruled constitutional by the Supreme Court, and hence is a valid law.  It requires all people in the US to buy insurance or face a penalty from the government.  The law will be coming into full effect on Jan 1st 2014 for individuals, right now congress, specifically the House of Representatives is attempting to add a delay to it (they originally tried to add a complete repeal of the law) as a rider to the budget they are passing.  The Senate refuses to pass the budget as a result of this, which has caused the previous budget to lapse without a replacement, causing all non essential federal programs to shut down until a budget is passed.   This has NOTHING to do with the debt ceiling, which is tackled separately.
0	I think the worst part for me (3 younger brothers) was dealing with my younger brothers fighting. I think it would have been much easier to deal with one younger brother and be his babysitter. He would have no one to fight with, however my 3 younger brothers all have a very short temper. At 12 you don't have the patience or experience to properly deal with this and I was miserable as the baby-sitter. I don't think parents understand that just because we are the oldest doesn't mean we are mature, we are still growing up too.  I had a fight with my parents because they didn't like the way I was baby-sitting them and that I should know better. I exasperatedly screamed that I was only 15 and not ready to raise children and they finally shut up. I think that was the first time they understood what they were asking of me.
1	i'm not sure it's such a good idea to want your GF or wife to play this game with you. Mines played the game on her own accord to know why i liked it so much, and would then become infatuated with the game and in turn loving it. You see it's one thing to tell your buddy that he messed up and this is where he/she should improve, but telling your wife or GF that they may not take it constructively even if you clearly explain your intent. Amount other things, but this was one of the more core problems I've encountered.
1	Haha morons, first off i am bronze 3 in solo Q after 800ranked matches, nice system riot. well and i am challangar on ranked 3v3 cuz i can play with no retards (i have onli played 5games but still).
0	In my experience the scale slides a little differently for each sex.   As in, a hot 9/10 girl will date a guy who is a 5/10-7/10 if his personality makes up for it and he treats her well.   A guy typically will not go more than 2 points below his scale no matter how spectacular the personality. If the guy is a 9/10 he's almost certainly not dating under an 8/10-7/10.   Again, just in what I have observed around me.   But  it should be noted that there is more wiggle room when both parties are 6/10 or under.
1	Actually the last thing that you should be doing in that situation is complaining, you are pretty much blessed if you know how to play versus that. Take into account that the fact isn't only that you are getting camped but that you KNOW that you are getting camped, so you actually don't even need wards, and on top of that just by playing safe and letting the lane be pushed to you you are distracting the enemy jungler while yours is free, which lets the other lanes play freely and safely. That should also give you free dragons btw.
1	upvotes are  meant  to only be for comments which contribute to the discussion, and downvotes are  supposed  to be for comments which take away from the discussion.   thus karma would be a scale of how much you make reddit better, based roughly on karma/years.   however, upvotes are more often than not used for "OMG that was so funny!" or "I agree with this statement, because it is in line with my own views"  and downvotes are being used for "I disagree with this statement" or "that was stupid." It's not like that everywhere on Reddit, but it is enough to dilute the effectiveness of karma for its original purpose.
1	I dunno man...with my trundle build, I've cleared very quickly. Max Q into max W as a laner, and as far as build goes I go 9/21 and flat AD red/quint, per lvl mr blue, flat armor yellow....Go in whatever order needed randuins/tf/bork/merc/sv/either LW or Mogs depending on if team needs you hitting harder or tanking better....You eat faces either way, and you can easily transition from an early/mid game tanky damage menace to a late game peeler who slows divers of your ADC for days. His damage remains respectable all game, and his ult/bork ensures no tanks can easily beat him. Keep in mind my build with LW does 289 AD or so on about a 2.2 AS with 3400+ hp and 160 each of armor/mr at 400 MS or so. It's quite disgusting. LW loses you some armor pen (Armor is an easy counter to his damage, but not his tank shred/peel potential so...) but mogs would make you that much tankier and make his ult that much stronger.   Keep in mind with BORK/TF and the AS boost from 9 offense, he can reach between 2.02 and 2.2 AS while on W...something like 1.6-1.8 without W. He hits like a truck and he hits FAST. Even as a laner, as long as you're not spamming W and running entire durations between Qs, you never really run out of mana especially if you pick up an early mana crystal and/or sheen for the mana.   EDIT - On the other hand, as a jungle trundle you'd wanna max E into Q if you're gank heavy. E for improvement of ganks, Q for early/mid game damage steal. if you're a bit more farm oriented in early game with him, rush a lizard or golem fist into cutlass/bork with merc treads whenever possible, and you can slow even better at a time in the game where people are transitioning to mid game tactics, leaving some lanes rather vulnerable to ganks they'd long since think undoable. Ya gotta know timings for that though, farm too 'long' and you've missed your opportunity...farm too 'little', and you've likely missed timings for early ganks with pre boot situations where your E is strongest.   One could argue jungle trundle doesn't need E maxed first if he's farm heavy as Q would suffice with slow or W could give MS for chase...but honestly with my idea of 'farm early' with jungle trundle, you'd start ganking at 8-10, so you'd still need E maxed first, or at the least at 3-4 points.
0	It's a double edged sword, especially at the intro level courses.   1: Expect most of them to be dumber than rocks. It's not their fault, for the most part they have not been taught how to think critically in High School... so that will be a significant portion of the intro level classes. One example: Intro to chem, lab experiment to measure the density of an egg by measuring the density of the solution it "just floats" in, they hear the instructor talking about weighing measuring the different volumetric devices  to get the mass of the solution. First instruction in the manual " measure out 500mL water and add NaCl until the egg floats between the bottom of the beaker and the top of the solution".... what do they think to do? "Weigh the empty beaker right?" The good part of it is, in lab or group based classes, you have to teach them, and the best way to  really  learn something is to teach / tutor someone else.   2: It gets better once you start getting to 200 level classes.  By then the ones who can't / won't learn to think and the ones who don't even bother to show up to class are weeded out.  300 level classes generally are the dedicated ones who will graduate with you, you probably won't even notice the age gap anymore.
1	You just don't get it, the development team at Riot is probably really small in comparison to some other more well known places. I mentioned this in a thread last year, the other offices they have around the world probably aren't developers they are just office workers who work for Riot to promote the game in those regions.   I'd wager their "Lore team" is probably less than 6 people in that company if it genuinely is 30 people like some have claimed then I would have to wholeheartedly agree that their output doesn't justify their wages as they haven't been doing anything substantial....So from the perspective that the community could probably pump out more content than Riot..You'd be correct because there would be so many of you doing it the problem is the quality and the direction of what you wrote.   You guys need to climb down from your inexplicably high horses for one moment..
1	It was last year on October.   I was addicted with Steam/Valve games (TF2 in partcular) and one of my friends asked me if i wanted to play LoL, i installed it, played 2 rounds, didn't understood anything at all (he was very bad at explaining) and i left.   December kicks in and my brother asking me countless times to let him play (his PC fucked up) so i let him and started getting some interest, and before he went away from home i still didn't touched the game.   Sick and tired of Team Fortress being nothing but hats and misc i decided to finally to play game (during Vi's release/january) andpicked Gangplank (because pirates are badass) i loved it to the point where i wanted to get good it, i got to Gold so i still have a lot of practice to do.
1	In a way it's a win-win for the troll and a lose-lose for you in the case he doesn't get banned. He does this to get people either dodge and make them lose Lp off the spot and end up not getting reported, or play the game with you where he will intentional feed and make you lose more Lp than if you dodged. Since the tribunal is down, his best chance of perma ban is basically in the 2nd screenshot as Riot Lyte mentions they have no tolerance for: racial slurs, homophobic remarks etc. Plus they know that once the game starts you're stuck with then til the end and can't leave without getting punished yourself.
1	In normals you can play whatever you want but in ranked you better not be fp'ing that shaco or picking him into their tanky/aoe team. That is tantamount intentional feeding as your pick has made every teamfight a 4v5. Ranked is about winning and if you are not picking the champ that gives you the greatest chance to win you are doing it wrong.
1	With huge fat tanks like Sion running a muck in this meta, double lifesteal works great way late game if lockdown (qss) or fed mages (banshee) are not a problem for you and you can keep good positioning.   IE -> Boots -> PD -> LW -> BT -> Bork   I've been going BT a lot first before LW if the enemy team are not building a lot of armor. Usually, when it's just one super tank, it's manageable to not go Bork. I don't think I would ever replace BT with Bork first. I would get Bork as a 6th item.   Double lifesteal does a few things. It gives you a surprising amount of survivabilility if nothing locks you down, and kills you immediately. (Ahri Charm, Lissandra Ulti etc.) Things that can be immediately chain CC'd. You shouldn't be that close to begin with. Taking damage is fine, you get full health with 1-3 auto attacks. It is great for things like Gnar, Pantheon, J4, Udyr, Renekton, Sion, just to name a few. Usually, these guys can probably all 1v1 you at full build. They just dive you and stick to you, and do not give you space. Let's use a Sion with Frozen Heart, Randuins, Warmogs, Thornmail, Merc boots, and banshee. He's beefy as hell, probably sitting on 4.5K+ HP, and you likely will kill yourself from his thornmail before making any noticeable impact to his HP bars. Banshee as a defensive 6th item will not help you deal with Sion. A Bork on the other hand, gives you % damage, a slow, and more sustain. Exactly what you need to deal with him as his stats gives him sustain over you otherwise. Sion doesn't do a ton of damage alone. His E hurts quite a bit, but when you can heal that up with consistent auto attacks, it's no problem. It may take awhile to kill him, still, but at least he's not killing you every team fight.   Credibility: I'm an ADC main since Season 3, although I've been playing since season 1, in high plat currently, and Caitlyn is one of my favorite champions. Currently at 63% win rate with her on my main out of 16 played, and is my most played this season.   ee-el-oh, below, mentions Crit, consistent DPS, and why BT over Bork is built on Caitlyn. Positioning is always crucial on ADC.

0	I rode my bike to the park (very nice neighborhood) with my 2 year old son. I considered not stopping there since there was a group of 6-10 yr old girls having a picnic near the playground. I decided to go ahead and not deprive my son of a fun couple of hours at the park. I'd just keep him on the other side of the play set to avoid any misunderstandings.   About 5 minutes after I showed up, the girls packed their shit and left.  Awesome , I thought,  now I can enjoy this time with my kid without being afraid someone is going to think I'm a creeper . Right? Right!?   Wrong. 10-15 minutes later mom and dad come bearing down on me asking me who I am, why I'm in the park, who my son is, what I did to frighten their daughter and her friends... WHOA!! I calmly tried to explain I was just in the park letting my son play, and that we come to this park a couple of times a week because it's close and his grandparents live in the neighborhood. They weren't listening at all, and I could tell dad wanted to escalate things.   Luckily there was a family setting up for a birthday party near the playground, and the mom came over and told this couple that she had taken note of me as soon as I arrived and hadn't seen me doing anything other than being a good dad playing with his son at the park. God bless that woman, after hearing her talk mom & dad settled down, apologized, and left.   I can't imagine what would have happened if that woman hadn't come to my aid, probably a call to the cops, possibly a physical confrontation, and all in front of my son.
1	Players who spam normals (i hate to say this, but it's true) just aren't tryhards. I'll admit I don't try my best in normals, I try new stuff. But the other day i queued up for a normal as vayne. The opposing jinx just let me freefarm, no harass or all ins until level 6 and then they telegraphed it quite obviously. It was so passive that it made me want to go back to ranked. My team took its time and didn't really do much at all. they grouped when they wanted to, not when we had to, dragon wasn't taken until level 13...etc, etc.
1	To be honest, i kinda liked the idea of the whole thing, but it didnt really worked with this low ammount of people. It could have been fun with a full room cheering, like it is a blast in NBA allstar games, etc, when the well-known players comes in 1 by 1 while the crowd cheering and goes mad.   There was some funny moment though. Cop's Annie imitation, Saint slapping Rachel's ass, etc...
1	SGS had a really strong early game in mid and top lane.  Tofu's Rumble snowballed pretty hard, and Chawy's Karma always had ReginaId pushed under his tower.  However, a combination of TSM's botlane outperforming SGS's and a few mistakes from SGS put TSM back into the game.
0	Ptsd affects I think about 1/3 of experienced soldiers and can vary in severity and triggers. As someone who had Ptsd I would advise not asking about it, if they bring it up they obviously need to talk about it and you should listen, but otherwise I wouldn't. Even if you don't think they have been diagnosed you shouldn't because it goes undiagnosed in some individuals. Mine wasn't from war, but was the same condition. It is not pleasant. Luckily over time I have gotten better, some never do.
1	Great job man! I'm an aspiring ui designer and love seeing other peoples work and learn from them. In my opinion, you definitely had it with your original concept. What I've learned throughout the years is that non designers def request things and think a way looks better, but they don't fully think about how each element works together and contributes to the whole.. You know the saying, too many cooks in the kitchen? I definitely see where you were going in your original design and I definitely prefer that one. I just feel that it is more efficient and makes sense, user friendly, and innovative.
1	Waveclear, burst dmg, cheap itemization, movement spd for bigger catch potential.   Early ludent burst more than any other possible item in a shorter period of time.   Faster movement also helps with roaming, positioning.   In fact there is very few a who doesn't buy early lucent especially in diamond plus level of play.   I know my points are not well expanded, it's basically a
0	I do that, but only because I would finish before everyone else, and a teacher would yell at me because it was "impossible to finish a test that fast." So I would go and sit until about 5 people turned theirs in, then turn mine in without changing anything.  We get it back, and I had an A+
1	If the question is serious, here.   Imagine we have two champions , X, and Y.   Both have 100 ap.   X champion's Q is a skillshot that hits the first target for 50 + (80%ap) dmg.   Y campion's Q is similiar, but hits for 140 + (35%ap) dmg   This means that "X" is gonna do 130 dmg with one Q, and "Y" is gonna do 175.   130 dmg comes from 50 + 80 percent of AP, and 175 comes from 130 + 35 percent of AP.   However, even though "X" will do less damage now, he scales better into the lage game, when the AP gets higher,   so if now they both have 400 AP,   Champ "X" will hit for 370 (coming from 50+400 x 0.8),  and "Y" will hit for 280 (coming from 140+400 x 0.35).
1	I main jungler. I loved s1 jungle so when they said s3 would be a mix between s1 and s2 I was pretty excited. I found s2 boring because the most viable junglers were the tanky ones and it was hard to play anything else in ranked. In the end I find the new jungle even less fun than s2 because you merely have more farm but with the oracle's nerf, the massive warding (sightstone), the early safety (bot usually have wards early, and now top+mid can start flask+pots/ward to  have huge sustain and map awareness),  and the fact that junglers can't really start boots but the lanes still can, you can't pull off ganks easily.   They wanted to diversify the champions in the jungle but what they did is quite the opposite imo. Since you have the same farm as before but ganks are harder to pull off, you need to play something that has huge cc, can gank through wards or can towerdive and doesn't need that much gold to do its job. Exactly the same type of junglers we used before the s3 changes.
1	Adding into this (probably solve most of laptop user): I used to run LOL in 60fps stable at the start of season 2, but then I started to get spiky 20-30ish during teamfight and sometimes even 0-10ish fps during teamfight or shop. I thought it was my laptop spec was outdated or something, turns out I got stable 60FPS again after I clean my laptop motherboard (I asked a computer shop to do it for around 10 bucks or smth) even when I use heavy program such as OBS (Open Broadcast Software).
0	OP, avoiding things that scare you teaches your brain that avoiding fear = reward ( not doing the thing one is afraid of). This teaches your brain to want to avoid any future social interaction and cause you to experience more fear in the future, this is how a phobia is strengthed. It's called operant conditioning/fear conditioning.
1	Ya Lot of Supports who scale so fast..  Meanwhile people who play carries get stuck...
1	MMR is your hidden rating (elo). It's used to provide a basis for matchmaking and LP gains/losses. That's why you can get matched up against for instance Gold II players when you are currently in Silver IV.   Also it sure is worth it. The higher you get now, the higher you'll be once the reset kicks in. Your "Reset-Day-MMR" will be used for the reset.
1	With the jungle being buffed a bit again, you may be able to once again carry a bad team from the jungle... Take a top level ganker (Udyr, Noc or whatever) If you want to win at all costs keep ganking the same lane over and over, the enemy is likely to ragequit, particularly at low elo.  Potential trolls/ragers on your team won't manifest unless they are losing usually, your job is to make the trolls appear on the other team.   You said you picked a tank because you were last, did you pick a tank who jungles? If your team needed a tank and a jungler there's no reason why you can't be both... If you didn't play a jungler because you can't then you need to learn how to, if not just for playing the role but for understanding your teammates better.   Cho works pretty well as a jungler/tank. :) His ganks are pretty annoying if the lane has cc. Stun>Knockup>Silence>other lane CC > NOMNOMNOM. You get to help the lane and get HP stacks from your ult! Not being able to do anything for 5 seconds while you die often causes ragequits...
0	Former driver here...(3 weeks into a desk job)   Generally it's just a matter of paying attention.     Give space on both ends.  Make sure you can see both mirrors.  When passing a truck, make sure you can see both of their headlights in your rearview before changing lanes again.  Also, when passing, even on a 4 or 6 lane, do it quickly.     When you want to pass, we want you to pass us too.  Just don't do something that is going to force us to make any sudden changes to speed or direction.  If we have to brake, to let in some jackass who thought he could beat oncoming traffic, it creates a chain reaction with other cars behind us rushing to pass because of how slowly we accelerate.     Likewise, when it's safe to pass, JUST DO IT ALREADY! Almost nothing worse than having a car tailgate you for miles, clearly wanting to pass, but can never make up their mind.  A good trucker will communicate with traffic behind them when it's safe to go (Either flashing their trailer lights, or moving to the inside of their lane)     If you see a truck trying to pass you, slow down a little bit.  Many trucks are governed which makes it a pain in the ass to pass when some numbnut doesn't want to disengage the cruise control.  Also, we don't want you beside us if we have a blowout. Because of regulations and deadlines, sometimes that extra 5 miles an hour can be the difference between making the load, or even making it somewhere they can have a shower in the morning.       example: I was rerouted to rescue a driver who was broken down in the middle of nowhere, in -50C weather.  It was a 3 hour drive to get to him, and I was the nearest human contact dispatch could find.  This was a health and safety issue.  I come up behind a car going 60 and my truck is governed at 65.  Once I get a long enough stretch to attempt to pass I go for it.  He ends up speeding up enough that I'm still gaining on him, but I end up driving side by side with him for over two miles.  Had to give up and slow down, but the whole time I was worried about getting there in time for my stranded coworker     On the flipside, don't be too courteous.   A good driver will always signal his intentions with their lights, and driving.  Just because you're going 20mph under the limit doesn't mean we will automatically want to pass you.  We might be getting off at the next exit, and realize that it would be more dangerous for you if we to try to pass and then make the exit.
1	I think a lot of people have a big misconception on why certain champions are "nerfed" in League.   First off, they need to keep the game flowing. Pro players will look for picks that give them the most valuable output for the least amount of practice effort. For example, while Draven is a very strong pick in and of itself, no one wants to bother having to play a mini game just to deal damage (juggle axes). This is a meh example but hopefully it makes sense.   Furthermore, adjustments are aimed at champions that give affect game play health in a negative way. For instance, Veigar proved very problematic to play against for most people. If it makes people frustrated to play against chances are they will want to change something. Veigar didn't really see competitive play all that much either.
1	The biggest difference is items. In league items are focused on providing a tool that makes any champ of that role good against something or just do its role properly.  Take morellonomicon for example, it's not an item that has any particular synergy with certain champions, it's a niche pick against certain champs like mundo or heal comps.  Other good examples include most ADC items and AP mid items, none of these items have particular synergy with any champions so when everyone buys the same ones, obviously you have to pick the champion who has stronger abilities, stats, ect. Items should not be designed to be a counter to certain champions or to be a "one size fits all" but should instead be designed to make certain champions excel or even just be more viable when buying them.  Two good examples of this are essence reaver and ardent censor (while arguably they may not be tuned to where they need to be, they are steps in the right direction) ER allows mana gated AD champs to be more appealing where they wouldn't be without it, Ardent censor is focused on helping more passive supports bring something extra to the table.

1	I've already done this and it helped a little bit but I'm still experiencing slight fps issues that end up affecting my gameplay. The 5 second freeze in shop has been mentioned by many players and it is drastic. There are many things that have been reported that make it sound like the issue is on Riots end and not the player's.
1	I am not praising myself.Its just a straight up question. Supposing I destroy my opponent in top or mid lane by playing champs that have early lane dominance or any champs for the sake of argument.What should I do after enemy mid or top tower falls?Even though I am plat,after crushing my opponent I just run like dickless chicken not knowing what i should do.These 10 minutes of midgame usually 20-30 mins I lose my immense cs lead,not able to pressure bot or any lane.
1	I know of 2 ways to go about this:   1: Stop caring about your division. That way you it won't matter if you lose or win. (I do this, because I just like to learn from soloqueue but don't feel the need to gain Diamond Elo or something.)   2: Play believing you'll reach your goal elo someday anyway. I think this is what pro players do, they just play.. because they like/have to play. And sooner or later they'll reach that Diamond 1 anyways.   So...

1	What most people don't realize is how snowbally the game is, this applies especially to top lane. Most of the time you can die to a well-performed gank by the enemy jungler and top, and if the enemy top so happens to get the kill, then it's just hell from there. You literally cannot CS properly without being interrupted by him or needing your own jungler's gank.
0	I was pulled over by some LEOs the other day at 1:30 AM for the dumbest reason. It was an early Sunday morning so they probably thought they could get an easy DUI on somebody that had been partying late on a Saturday night. I was driving perfectly and I was the only car on the road.   So they pull me over, ask me some questions and proof of insurance/registration, etc. I could have invoked my rights and a bunch of other bullshit and given them a hard time but these guys are just trying to do their job and it'll be over with quickly if you don't give them  a hard time. What lasted 10 minutes could have lasted  a lot  longer had I started pissing them off.

I work for "Big Oil" and we have a department who's job is to facilitate communication between the landmen (those taking the leases from the mineral rights owners), roughnecks (people drilling the actual well and setting up the pumpjack operation), and our analysts (keep up with the property statistics and financials, which is what I do).   This department that facilitates has to deal with some really stupid owners sometimes; some of them have no idea how valuable oil and natural gas are, some try and act "smart" and try to over-negotiate and end up not getting leased because we don't have to deal with people like them and they often try to cause a lot of trouble, and then there's this guy in Alabama, I swear to god his name was "Bubba".   We called Bubba to let him know we would be sending some techs out to scout the land to decide what we'll need to set up a wellsite, which we are 100% legally allowed to do. Well, Bubba doesn't like the idea of "strangers" on his land, so he locks the gate to his property (it is illegal to keep us from entering his land in this situation) and is sitting in a plastic lawnchair with a side-by-side 12-gauge shotgun, which he promptly loads as our truck pulls up.   Our techs nope'd the fuck outta there and called our legal department to have them work on getting some legal assistance, which we did and Bubba got a nice long trial.
0	Woe... So true. Its worse for you than smoking. Less than 100% of smokers die.  Example.  50 smokers in a group.  Then 10 quit smoking, and are no longer smokers. All 50 people die.  That means that 40 smokers died and 10 non smokers died. So out of the original 50 smokers, only 40 smokers died...  Which means  only an 80% death rate.
0	It's worth pointing out that every single person I worked with at taco bell (except this one teenage girl) had a college degree. One even had a  master's in economics  - but directly after 'the great recession', that wasn't exactly in high demand.   Also, the whole 'put out enough resumes and someone will hire you' thing is total BS. That's not how hiring works. It's very possible to apply to hundreds of places and not get hired, simply because you aren't qualified/they aren't hiring/your resume is crap/you don't fulfill a needed quota.
1	My problem with building a new passive on Taric is that he's already quite strong.  He was originally designed as a fighter type instead of a support, and while the ult didn't carry over from that idea, the passive did.  It doesn't function in his primary role as a support, but any realistic change to his passive would be a buff, since it's really almost never relevant.  Sans hybrid/bruiser/jungler/non-support items, he doesn't attack fast enough to get regularly relevant cdr on his heal (yes, people get clutch heals sometimes, we're talking consistent help), and the mana he gets back from the hits are kinda pathetic.  The mana regen is even smaller than Kassadin's passive on his dinky little sword buff, and Taric's heal is pretty mana inefficient, considering the more popular healers like Soraka or support Kayle.  Most Taric players smack people for the damage and pretty much get mana only from towers or dragon, because pushing is not worth it and champions are better killed than leeched for mana.
0	These traits don't really add up to being fooled by that manipulative crap.   Not at first, no. But manipulation tends to be a gradual process. If you look at people in abusive relationships talk in therapy, they're not under the pretense that they're in an unhealthy relationship. It is often seen clearly by the therapist but making it known to whom are often otherwise very stable and good people can be very difficult.   Highly subjective, without a doubt. But the vast majority of people are vulnerable to this kind of manipulation, I'd say.   > Bitter guys who are tired of having girls manipulate them and walk all over them in the past go way too far and end up just treating other women in exactly the same manner.   There's no justice in collective punishment.   > I guess I can objectively see the appeal just because I'm aware people love power.   It can also be an acquired taste. Another reason, perhaps, for why the doctrine can be so well rooted in some people.   > But for me, relationships are about being equal partners in life.   As for me. There shouldn't be any particular conflict between partners. It should be, really speaking, the two joined together to tackle each others' or both of their issues and make the most out of their time.   > Yeah fights and disagreements happen but when they do I prefer to sit down and sort it out, not play games or manipulate someone into doing what I want.   It's not... well, it's not "convincing" someone to stay with you or to see your side of the point if you do it slyly, really. Arguing isn't my strong suit, because I don't see the point in it -- you know, the arguing that involves yelling and name-calling. When it comes to disagreements, I just assume debate-mode and go from there. Find the cause of the disagreement, find the reason for the disagreement and, if I still think I'm right, try to convince my girlfriend that I am.   It often works, and that's partly because I chose to be with a girl that is logical and fair. Most of the "Common GF problems" haven't applied to me.   > I mean I personally am actually very good at manipulation (it's not hard), it's just never something I've felt the need to bring in to a relationship.   I feel the same way. Manipulation, people don't realise, isn't like in the movies. It's not evident until it's already occurred, or not even then, if you do it right. A lot of my 'technique' stems simply from my openness to discussion with practically anyone. Because I can have a legitimate interest (and not even fake it) in someone's hobby, or just our subject of conversation, I can easily get on the good sides of many people. That works to my advantage a lot, without trying to be manipulative at all, to be honest.   > but taking that a few steps further and using it to justify mental abuse is going too far.   Whenever they try to put forth a generalisation about women, it tends to be too far. Sometimes, they're actually alright, but many of them believe that it applies to  all  women. Scientific bases for some of these things are fair to use, but, as Mathematics is scientific as well, you cannot assume the probability that all women adhere to the same 'rule' or 'function' is 1. And there's a million reasons for why that is the case. But many of them don't see women as the same, self-help and logical beings that, well, anyone can be.   > End of the day I think that sub and the philosophy does far more harm than good.   Absolutely. Which is unfortunately, really. It probably could've been used a lot to help people in general with low-confidence.   > There are other, better ways to boost your confidence rather than going all out.   Definitely. I've never had an issue with confidence, though I'd love to learn how to boost others' more.   > For instance, I'm sure you may have heard of Tucker Max and how he got tons of girls to sleep with him by being an asshole and having 'game'.   Honestly? Not heard of him. But it doesn't sound far-fetched or even particularly unusual. Playing the 'game' isn't my objective, and I don't see the "thrill of the hunt" when all you're doing, really, is  being an asshole.   Doing something that is innate to you isn't really... rewarding  or  skillful. Capitalising on naturally attractive features that so many females -- like most humans -- wouldn't think about falling for (but will, naturally)  isn't  "having game". To me, at least.   I think better of my having a 2-year relationship without having an argument with a girl that, like I'd said earlier, is logical and fair, than people who've slept with tens or hundreds of girls. One is more difficult than the other, because it's work and commitment. The other is frankly the 'lazy' route, and I'll never understand some people who glorify something so mundanely easy, to be frank.   With that said, you can have a listen at much of the mainstream music and note that people will glorify just about  anything  mundane and easy. :P   > Some girls found it amusing but unlike Mr. Max, this guy didn't happen to look like a male model with a ripped body.. something rarely mentioned in his stories.   Presentation is the  most  important, but a lot of the "cheeky" approaches  really  need a first good impression.   > Don't get me wrong, I'm sure the guy was excellent at getting women to sleep with him, but having a baseline of being good looking and in great shape removes a lot of obstacles when it comes to getting girls.   It can easily increase the chances, although it's hardly a necessity for a lot of guys, I think.   > however in his month of being a complete dick something had happened. He'd gained huge amounts of confidence in his ability to walk up to girls and speak to them, brush off rejection and move on. From then, he really didn't have many issues with women. Because he could actually approach them, speak to them and not be a doormat.   Which is quite useful. I wouldn't like to say that the approach was worth it -- I wouldn't argue for the negative effects on others just to boost one's confidence or give him a positive effect. But it is good, nonetheless, that something good was achieved out of it.   A shame that gaining confidence took such an extreme measure, though.   > I'm rambling a bit here but I think my point really is that while some of the ideals behind TRP are valid and beneficial... the way the entire philosophy is presented in that sub is utterly destructive.   I think that is the
1	That doesn't happen though. The teams that dominated this season - TPA/Koreans - are all super agressive teams who play super aggressive in every lane. On the other hand, only CLG.eu has had any success with their passive play, mostly due to specific champion choices (Anivia/Kog support passive play/turtling, and are the core to their best comps).   It's pretty simple really - assuming equal skill, aggressive play is more powerful in lane, at the cost of being vulnerable to ganks. If every lane is agressive, the jungler is faced with a choice of sacrificing 2 lanes and ganking 1 lane. This is a net win for the aggressive team.   Of course, this requires too much co-ordination for soloQ. On top of that, skill tends to vary greatly in your average match, and aggression done badly tends to do more harm than passivity done badly.
1	I do enjoy having both limited and legacy skins, but for different reasons and for different circumstances.   Limited  is, as everyone knows, great in the idea of exclusivity you get when you own a skin like it during a certain point of time (ex. S2 WCS, Closed Beta, Vancouver 2010, etc.) because it signifies the significance of that skins' connection to that era in League of Legends history, however small the era may be. OP already said this, but S3 won't happen again and having a skin that comes back to signify S3 years later speaks inconsistency and disappointment that the skin's connection with that moment.   Legacy  is great in the fact that sometimes people aren't playing until after the skin is gone, or actually just can't get the skin at that time. I have spent a good amount of money on Riot's game and I will continue to do so, but sometimes I just can't dedicate $10-20 every time an awesome skin or bundle of skins come around. The winter skins this past year are a good example for me personally, because I couldn't get BS Veigar or Slay Belle Kat then. You may agree or disagree about how good those skins are, but the point is I wasn't in a good position to just convert more money into RP and buy them. This is where I also think holiday skins as a collective whole need to become, simply because Halloween 2011 isn't much different from Halloween 2012 aside from being a different year. The FIFA World Cup 2010, on the other hand, is a big deal and it should be recognized as extra-special because of it.   I hate to jump on bandwagons, but there needs to be explicit established procedures for how they're doing skins, particularly on both present/future skins and past skins. It's not wrong to assume that S3 Champ Thresh would have been limited, because S2 Riven was and it makes logical sense. It's also not wrong to want it to be limited because of its connection with this past year in LoL. But then again, it's also not fair to switch over the policy of having holiday skins become legacy when there are still skins that are holiday-themed and limited, because that inconsistency is what frustrates people.   This is all just my view on this, but I'm more comfortable with having certain guidelines on different types of special skins with  consistency  on being limited/legacy, as opposed to some being one way and some being another.
0	In college, I was living in a house with 8 other guys. One day, I sat down to take a dump, and before long I feel a very strange and not very nice sensation starting from the tip of my penis and down one side.   I pull it up to find some giant fucking bug that looks like the offspring of a walking stick and a praying mantis hugging my wang for dear life. I try to pull it off, but it won't budge and it hurts like hell where its legs are poking into me. I don't know what it is, I'm afraid it's going to bite me, and I don't know if it's poisonous and also I don't care because  it's on my dick .   Fear has claimed nearly all of my available mental faculties by this point, so I do the only rational thing: I scream bloody murder for my roommate across the hall to come help.   I will never forget the look on his face when he entered the room and learned of my predicament, nor ever forget his kindness in gently de-mantising my junk.
1	Firstly, I haven't been playing LoL very long, although I played a lot of DotA and HoN. This is my first LoL account and I'm only level 25, so most people on here have more experience than I do.   Secondly, I've been maining Akali (at least since season 1 haha) and I'm pretty sure we're both using the same guide. The guide is really good and there's a lot of theory behind his build, but if you can't match his runes and masteries then you lose the perfection that makes his build so great.   --- Items ---   Anyways, **[here's my recent evolution of Akali builds]( I've found that this item build works the best for me:     Regrowth Pendant OR Amplifying Tome + HP Pot   Mejai's Soulstealer (optional)   Mercury's Treads   Rylai's Crystal Scepter   Hextech Gunblade   Lich Bane   Zhonya's Ring     And now for some comments about the build.   I don't get Doran's Blade off-the-bat like he recommends. With his setup, he's got just over +4 to dmg from runes, so that with the +6 from Doran's Blade he perfectly activates his spell vamp passive at level 1. In my case, I couldn't afford +4 to dmg through runes, so I've avoided Doran's Blade at the start, and avoided activating that passive altogether until later in the game. With Doran's Blade as my only +dmg item, I find that it takes me until level 8 or 9 until my spell vamp passive naturally activates based on only my Doran's, my runes, and my masteries. One alternative that I've found is to try rush a Hextech Revolver and get your Hextech Gunblade as quick as possible, because the component items help you get your passives really easily (+25 dmg from 975g Pickaxe, +20 AP from 435g Amplifying Tome).   I'm tempted to say that you should get Mejai's Soulstealer every game. Out of the 10 games in the screenshot, I only got Mejai's in 4 of the games. In those 4 games with Mejai's I went 54-20-74, whereas in the 6 games without Mejai's I went 27-20-34. Personally, I'll probably get Mejai's more often than I have been after seeing those numbers. However, it could well be that I only bought a Mejai's in those games after I already knew the game was going to be easy or I was doing really well early game, so the Mejai's is probably more the effect of doing well and not the cause of doing well.   I don't rush a Sheen like he does in the guide. Mostly, I just don't like the idea of spending 400g on a Sapphire Crystal during my first or second trip to the shop when I could get like boots+potions or items that help my passives. I understand the benefit of Sheen as Akali has very nice back-and-forth cast-attack-cast-attack combos, which is why I do get a Lich Bane along the way, but I always try to build Mercury's Treads and Rylai's Crystal Scepter before anything else (excepting maybe a Mejai's Soulstealer in between).   --- Ability Order ---   At level 1, start with Q. I used to start with E, but it doesn't do as much damage and won't help last-hit as well as Q. I've even tried starting with W, the smoke bomb, which is actually the most fun way to start and doesn't work out too badly, but it's still not as good as Q.   At level 2, get E, unless you're already facing heavy harass, in which case get W.   At level 3, get whichever ability you didn't get at level 2.   From there, your priority is R -> Q -> E -> W. Your ulti is the chasing tool, so it's the number one priority. Then, obviously, you need as much damage output as possible, so Q and E are the second and third priorities. The smoke bomb is primarily an escape mechanism, and level 1 should suffice until late game.     Q     W/E     E/W     Q     Q     R     Q     E   Q   E   R   E   E   W   W   R   W   W     --- Summoner Spells ---   In terms of Summoner Spells, Masteries, and Runes, the main point is that I used to run totally defensively, and eventually migrated into an entirely offensive setup. In my 10 games as Akali from the screenshot, my total damage output is 747,144, while my damage taken is only 200,394. So I'm outputting almost 4 times the damage I'm taking.   For the Summoner Spells, I've been running Exhaust/Ignite to max out my killing potential. If you have a hard time remembering to use Exhaust or Ignite or using them at the right times, then it's much more important to grab the spells you're comfortable with here, such as Ghost, Flash or Cleanse. One minor point here is that, if you get the Improved Ignite mastery, you may want to cast Ignite whenever possible early game, as the 10 ability power can help your passive.   --- Masteries ---   In terms of Masteries, I started with Akali by putting all 25 of my points into the Defense tree. Eventually, I put 9 points into Offense for Archaic Knowledge (+15% magic res penetration) with the rest in Defense. Currently, I've got 25 in Offense. I get both Improved Exhaust and Improved Ignite. Of the Offensive masteries, the ones to avoid are attack speed, critical strike chance, and critical strike damage, although I personally still prefer to get those over the early Defensive masteries.   ---  Runes  ---   With runes, try to match what he does in the guide, as I don't think his rune setup could really be improved. I'm still trying to buy up more champions, so I couldn't afford much on runes, but I did manage to make a custom rune page specifically for Akali for only a few hundred IP (excepting the quintessence runes) using only Tier 1 runes. From the red marks, I get +8 physical damage at level 18. From the yellow seals, I get 1.9 health regen per five seconds. From the blue glyphs, I get +12 ability power at level 18. For the purple quintessences, I just used the move speed ones that I already owned, although you should try to get the +damage ones like he recommends.   ---  Random Tips  ---   I'm sure you know this, but  always go for an ability power build , not attack damage. Nothing usually bothers me more than stacking AP on a hard carry, as I absolutely HATE a hard carry with shitty auto attacks. Consequently, this is the reason why I LOVE Akali. According to my calculations, at 220 AP your hits deal 50% bonus magic damage. Now consider that it's really easy to break 500 AP on Akali, and the fact that the bonus magic damage usually takes a fair bit less resistance than the physical damage, and you've got nasty auto attacks with an AP-stacked champion. So yeah, always stack AP.   Mid and late game, you do ridiculous damage to towers.  I don't know exactly how it works, although I believe it's due, once again, to the bonus magic damage that your attack gets from stacking ability power, and I assume that towers have really high natural armor but very little magic resistance. Basically, if you have a chance to get free hits on a tower, you should definitely take it. During late-game you can solo down a turret in under 5 seconds. I'm pretty sure that even Alistair won't hit towers as hard as Akali, even with his passive maxed out.   In terms of smoke bomb usage,  [I made this visual guide]( When possible,  drop your smoke cloud right next to a tall grass patch**. Sure, the benefits seem obvious, but when I first started Akali I highly underestimated how many times that transition to tall grass would save my life. I'm sure you understand how this tactic can be useful, but it's probably way more useful than you think it is.   This one relates to that last point. I believe that there's about a  half-a-second delay before you become visible after leaving your smoke cloud , although this may be a combination of delayed animations plus delayed enemy reaction time, so I may be wrong here. In relation to the last point, you can leave a small gap between the edge of your smoke cloud and a tall grass patch.
1	I guess you could be correct.. But I have a color deficiency (color blindness) in the Red/green spectrum. I Think remember someone quoted as saying that 1 in 10 males have it.   Therefore the colors on Dota2 are ridiculously hard to see for anyone with the same affliction. The colors (for me) just merge into a sea of green and browns that I can't differentiate what is what. Add to that the Mostly RED and Deep Blue tonned Spell particles and I seriously can't see anything as the colors all merge together.   For me Greens and Browns look different to me. My wife tells me that I have trouble telling them apart from each other. And I have real trouble seeing Dark Blues on a screen also. Dark blues tend to look black to me, which in Dota2 makes them disappear for me. (minion are blue I think) Similar for the Deep magenta color.   So what I say is actually accurate. despite your immature protestations.   LoL on the other hand has a Colorblind mode which is just the best. But even before they had this the colors of LoL were much much much easier to see than Dota 2 for me. The whole color spectrum used was brighter and much much better IMHO. Clearer Crisper and amazing.   Dota2 has lots of bleeding edges (colors become transparent at the edges so makes it look really fuzzy) and , nighttime was almost impossible for me.   LoL didn't used to, but now has it creeping in to meet the requirements of China players as they are used to that sort of over the top graphics in their games.
1	Just in case this doesn't get answered ill answer to the degree I can being a diamond 1 player (~30 points). I play all roles so I'm by no means an expert and will delete this if lemon responds.   Lulu is reasonably weak in lane right now. Even though her poke is still strong, she lacks sustain in both the form of a heal for her ad and mana for herself. In previous iterations of the game lulu was a stronger version of Janna, but after her nerfs it seems Janna is filling that role.   Janna is a stronger peeler late game (arguably the best in the game) and that is great in the current game where team fight execution during extremely lategame scenarios is important (think CLG...they've had tons of games go past 40 minutes).   I feel as though both Sona and Nami are currently stronger in lane than Lulu in their trading potential and their lategame teamfight is slightly stronger. Lulu's ult was primarily used as followup for wombo combo comps, and that is effectively the same with Nami's tsunami and Sona's crescendo. To top it off, lulu is a little bit harder to play properly IMO due to her many variants in skills; thus meaning the trade off for playing a top-notch lulu is not worth it comparing to a flawless Sona.

0	I woke up early at around 7 am to get dressed and go vote. I'm 19, being the youngest in line this early didn't really surprise me.   My circle of friends however didn't vote. They all said that politics gives them headaches, and that voting is stupid. A considerable waste of time to them.
0	I work in a small retail store located in what most would consider the ghetto we have customers all the time who come into the store and leave their stereos in their cars on full blast. I usually ask them to shut it off as were also beside a restaurant and wouldn't appreciate that if I was eating. A few weeks back one guys came in and the entire building felt like it was shaking. I asked if next time he came in the store to cut off the music. He didn't respond and left.   30 minutes later he strolls into the store to have a chat about what was wrong with his music. I informed him its disruptive and rude to others who might not want to hear the music. He immediately pulled the race card. It took about 5 minutes before I finally said "I don't care if you're white, black, hispanic, Asian, etc. Its disturbing the customers in my store, the restaurant next door, and the employees here. If you don't like it then don't shop here." He then proceeded to cop and attitude and ask if I stopped the motorcycles and import cars going down the street for being loud. I then had to explain that they weren't sitting outside reving their engines and disturbing people so no I don't stop them.   Ever since that day he pulls up the the store with his music just as loud and sits in his car for 2 minutes before shutting it off and coming inside.
1	This last week will be insanely intense. Assuming Gravity loses to C9 and T8 loses to CLG, Gravity vs T8 will surely decide the 5th spot in playoffs. Then if TL beats with DIG and WFX, then there will be a tie breaker for the last spot between TL and Gravity/T8, since TL has a 1-1 record with both teams. If Gravity beats C9, T8 beats Gravity, and TL goes 2-0, then there will be a 3-way tie.   Then there's also the shenanigans of the top 4 spots, since there's a good chance there will be a tie breaker of some way for top 2 (most likely 2nd spot). There's also a possibility of a tie-breaker for 8th and 9th place...
0	I used to be a cashier and an old man shook my hand after I gave him his change. It caught me off guard, and when I saw a middle-aged woman reaching for a reciept on the counter I recognized what I thought was the "I want to shake your hand" body language from earlier. For some reason after she dodged my outstretched hand and we both realized what was taking place I grabbed her hand anyway and shook it. I guess I was trying to cover it up or something. God it was so awkward.
0	I feel the same way about the physical abuse I went through as a child with my ex stepdad. He was really sadistically power hungry. There was one incident when he gave me 5 minutes to get all the pants on that I could. I got on three pairs of jeans and a snowsuit, then went and got him the back scrubber from the shower, and bent over the couch. The first hit put me on my knees, and I know he hit me at least one more time. Apparently my aunt and grandmother noticed I couldn't really sit comfortably, so they planned for my aunt to "accidentally" walk in on me in the bathroom when I came to her house after school. Instead, she walked in on me changing and pretty much forced me to show her my ass. Not gonna lie, it was pretty much all just black. She started crying and got her now ex husband and they took me to DFACS. There, they made me stand against a wall with my pants down, while a lady took pictures of my ass with my aunt holding a ruler next to it (measuring the bruises). The whole experience was absolutely HUMILIATING. On the bright side, I've always felt a strange sense of safety around my aunt ever since.
0	Background and Story   I’ll post this as a comment and will just link to it when folks ask for the story.  It’s been explained to me that this is the proper reddit etiquette.   I was just hired to a new company.   I’ve been there since the middle of December.  I don’t have a place to sit in the local office, they’re going to move me to the main office quite a few states away once I deliver some key local projects.   So I’ve been squatting from place to place.  I ended up being told I could share this guy’s office.  I’ll refer to him as the Cancer Guy (or CG for short) since he made that comment.   So, I’m there, in this small room.  He has a desk off to one side and I have a corner table that’s actually behind him.  Now, he could have moved shit around to make so I had to sit in front of him, but he didn’t.   I walk in and he alt-tabbed out of a screen pretty quickly and I see its reddit.  So I start the conversation to get to know him.  Oh, you reddit?   He then asks me if I reddit and give a partial truth.  I tell him I have an author’s account for writing hobby.  I have self-published two novels and some short stories and we talked about that.  In fact he even bought one of my books (no I won’t share that as I don’t want my r/l linked to this account).  Edit to this he actually bought everything I’ve written…damn… okay, I owe him next lunch.   He shows me his account, what he’s doing, and some other guy he’s arguing with that he’s “about to let have it”.   Then I leave to do work, and am off by myself sitting on a con call for a meeting and I make a meme.   It blew up.  I never thought it’d make front page but it did.   And he saw it.  He saw it that night when he was at home.   He freaks out.  He copies all my stuff from my account and then deletes his account.   Then I go to work the next morning.   I walked into his office this morning set my laptop up to start checking shit and he just looks at me with this weird grin and says "Well, good morning Goblin Dick Smasher".   I was like "oh shit, well, let’s get this done" and I start talking to him about it.   He kept it secret that he had taken copies of my stuff until we were at lunch.  He said he was really afraid of me getting him fired and he wanted a “mutually assured destruction” option.   I told him if I wanted to get him fired I’d end up being fired as well since I’d have to share my account as proof, and losing a brand new job and that wasn’t on my to-do list.  That I’d rather deal with him honestly, with honor and integrity and he liked the idea and deleted his stuff while I watched.  And I know, how do I know he doesn’t have copies?  I believe him.   We ended up going to lunch and talked a lot.  This is in the morning, lunch, and at times in between while I worked.  I’m a project manager and he’s a developer so right now I’m way busier than he is, he’s also fucking brilliant at his job.  The reason he’s at the smaller company is interesting.   But, we talked about why the vitriol on his arguments and he honestly didn’t know.  HE talked about himself and his life a lot.  He doesn’t have any friends outside of the MMO’s he plays.  He was married, met a woman in the PI, married her, had two kids, when she was a citizen she divorced him and them moved across the country.  He didn’t handle that very well, didn’t get a lawyer, which he should have, and she took him for everything, including 60% of his pay to child support.  She’s married now to someone else and he never sees his kids.   This is why I think, and he thinks I’m probably right, he’s mean to people on-line.  He can’t be mean to people in person, but he has to get it out.   His way out of the debilitating money was to become unemployed and then argue for a reduction.  So 60% of what his unemployment was is what he was paying for.  He also argued for visitation, bus since he was remote he couldn’t get in person, but the judge agreed to open communication and summer vacation with him.   He then got another job and got a place for them to stay at when they’re with him.  They don’t want to come, they aren’t happy when they’re with him, and they are happy to go back home.  Thing is, this guy is a genius at what he does, but has zero social capability, and has zero notion of how to be a dad much less a single parent for a summer vacation.   Anyway, I’m digressing from the point.  The other guy, the IT guy, CG knows he’s a slimy guy.  But IT Man is a one-guy IT shop for a small company and is  heavily  relied upon by the owner.  I don’t have the time in service with this company nor the confidence of the owner just yet to be able to fix that.  Just yet.  And I’m too new to try and do some “get someone fired” stuff.  So I’m going to let it go and table it for a time when I am in the position to do something about it.   Now,
1	thats such a retarded statement. anyone with basic knowledge of control theory could tell you this.   just consider this simple example: if you have a car you can either use the brakes to slow down or stomp on the other one to go faster. now how does that apply to what OP said? pretty simple, you take one of those 2 options away and drive your car with only acceleration or brakes, pretty damn fucking innefficient huh?   so saying: <<if you don't have to say anything positive (accelerate) don't say anything (don't use brakes)>> is beyond dumb.   obviously there is a huge range of negative feedback, so telling someone "wow" or "dat ulti miss" pretty damn useless, whereas saying: "stop position yourself behind me as a tank" is very useful as it gives clear and simple advice on how to improve next time.
1	Building ADC's is a matter of preferences most of the time, however, sometimes it also depends on the matchups(Whole enemy team).   You need to think(Yes, theorycraft so to say) the game and predict how the game will go in the future. As an ADC your job is to do as much dmg you can before you die or need to retreat from the fights, hence why you build damage.   When talking about builds, it depends on the champ on what you do. But the standard builds so to say is to go, Lifesteal item(BT/BoTRK), AS(PD or Shiv) into Last Whisper. I'd personally recommend you to always get LW as 3rd item.   If we talk BoTRK and BT, I'd sum it up like this, do you need to get close to dmg, get BoTRK, if not, get BT.  Vayne = BoTRK  Caitlyn = BT   Lets say the enemy has one hell of a fed Jax player, and you know he'll dive you, and the teamfights begin to happen rather early, then you should get a defensive item early too, to counter their aggression and make sure you can survive, this can be done by getting either GA or Randuins.   In terms of Inf Edge first, it's mostly done when either ahead, or building for something special, like Twitch ultimate, hoping for crits in early teamfights(Inf Edge/PD -> Teamfights).
1	The biggest issue isn't even if you will allow it, because most unknown streamers get insta downvoted by BM redditors. Not saying that everyone is like that. I say bring it back and just crackdown on spammers. As many posts should be allowed, BUT with that being said if you spam and get no responses or is downvoted and you keep spamming your stream you should be banned for xx amount of time from the sub-reddit. This way streamers who are on the rise or are interesting can post on a daily/weekly basis until they establish a twitter/facebook etc to notify people who are interested in watching their stream.

1	Down in The Netherlands, allot of people tend to take a year break from Collage to Uni transition (not sure how the system works in other countries but just to give the idea) They end up either traveling 3-12 months (after saving up, or going for a low budget adventure trip), work for a year to get some good money, get their own space and have no debts after Uni or something else in this kind of way. Basicly, you follow your dream for a year.   If you want to try becoming a pro LoL player, it's something you could do if you really feel like your capable of doing so, and your able to get the money for it, or have parents supporting such things.   However,  I do feel like it's something which is highly unlikely if you don't have a strong sense of self-reflection (You wont grow fast enough, if your not honest with yourself, in lol term ''Elohell/DivisionHell'')   If this is something you really want to put to the test, then give it some good think trough, make formats, goals etc. (Info for yourself, and to the community) Note everything you do, check your mistakes.  If your going to stream, notice that most of the time it's harder to be the ''tryhard guy'' making it impossible to talk much..well atleast in most cases.   Make plans for the future..what if your getting bored to death because of playing so much? You might quit..What then? Got your CV ready to pick up some work for the last months? Are you able to enroll halfway?
0	If you make it a habit and it becomes a habit you can use habit as evidence in court. In case some low-life officer tacks on failing to signal on to whatever else you're getting ticketed for. Yea I was speeding, changing lanes ridiculously, BUT I SIGNALED! Boom! Knocked off one charge.. boo yah!
0	Just my 2 cents ... Both my sons have almost choked my 14yrs old swallowed a penny when he was 4 or 5. He comes into my room turning blue .. My wife panics and starts screaming! I calmly grabbed him and covered his mouth and nose with my mouth and blew a big breath so I could expand his lungs, ( if you try to stick your finger in there mouth you could cause more damage and might get the object stuck or cut them) he swallowed the penny... My youngest son did the same thing a couple years later my wife didn’t panic this time she handled it like a pro... My 3 sons all know CPR now, I have watched my sons give each other the Heimlich
0	Whatever happened to skepticism? Why do all of you trust a story that has no photographic evidence? Or any other real evidence otherwise? He provided a name and a hotel name and was ambiguous about the year. From the little gif stoy he told he says that they wondered who the older dude was who walked in. So he isn't even sure it was Woody in the first place. Add on it was "somewhere between 13 or 20 years ago, give or take a few years" and you could have a very fuzzy memory of a drunken party that took place after prom in a hotel.
1	Let me tell you this... Yesterday we had a Cassiopeia on our team.   We were losing every other lane than bot, and cassio had something like 0/6 so she didn't do any major damage to the enemy team.   Enemy team was pushing to our top inhibitor. Cassio flash+ulted all 5 players stunning them. That ult won us the whole game, we managed to get baron and finish the game after that. We were seriously 20 kills or so behind at that point. We had no enemy turrets down before that and enemy Irelia was just freefarming top lane.
0	My brother wasn't a glass blower in college, but he  did  make a ton of bongs.  Not a ton of money, he traded for weed.   Here's the anecdote:   I went up to visit him while I was on break in high school, but he still had classes.  Stayed in the dorm with him, and he'd make a bong a day, out of  anything  he could find.  MacGyver type, you know one, or are one. I tested out his creations while I was there. Anyway, one morning, he built a monster bong out of some sort of high density cardboard tubing and some bits of metal from the shop (he's a mechanic, was going to school to learn more then).  It was about 4 feet long, and the bowl was probably teacup sized.  Monstrous.  He told me to get into the closet (typical dorm non-built-into-the-wall kind), and handed me The Beast.   I sat there on a shelf while he packed the utter shit out of that bowl.  After a little bit of trouble getting it lit up to his satisfaction, he slapped some metal lid contraption with a hose coming off it onto the bowl and slammed the closet door, with me in there.  I had no idea what was going on, but then I heard him fire up an air compressor.  The next thing I knew, my eyes were burning, my lungs were burning, and him and his roommate held the door shut, until the smoke pouring into the room died down (I think it was less than a minute.  Air-powered turbo bongs burn very quickly, that's why he packed it so much).  I don't remember a whole lot from the rest of that day, except wanting [these]( really badly.   He sold that for 50 bucks, complete with (stolen) air compressor, and that's 1982 bucks.
1	It's not explaining anything really. It has a small chance of tilting them, and is relatively harmless. I wouldn't just throw that out there unless they'd been shittalking and I clearly felt like it was skill. If I actually think it was luck i'm the first person to say "yep". Whatever has the most likelihood to make me look calm and them look stupid is what I'm going to say (or just keep my mouth shut).
1	While I agree that it is nice that c9 are very composed, I think trash talk and bashing other times creates a lot of hype around games and around league in general. It's one of the reasons that imo NA is more interesting to watch than EU cause there's so much more hype around NA games often created by the bashing/trash talking. I also feel that in the end trash talking can only damage your play on the rift.
1	Back story:     Monte and Thorin are up to their normal cunty rude shenanigans during their show and say some rude things about Dig team   Odee flips out in Twitch chat trying to defend his team and calls Thorin, Monte, and Patoy cunts.   Odee rightly gets fined $1000 for losing his cool (hes lucky that's all it was), as he has been known to do in the past.   Monte continues to act like a smug prick and makes another snarky comment on twitter because Dig got destroyed today.
1	It's Evelynn because one of the clues is "assassin". This means the only ones that can be included are Xerath and Evelynn. The "six" clue could be involved in both of these because of the two both having SIX letters in their name. The "hide" clue is in favor of Eve though. Hide could be another word for stealth, meaning Eve would get the skin. Plus, Clue "J", could mean Jungler, which also supports Eve. Also, the "S" clue could also stand for Stealth, so another clue pointing at Eve getting the skin. Plus, Eve hasn't received a skin since October of 2010 (Xerath's last skin was in July of 2012), so most signs point to Eve getting the skin.   (P.S. I am not an Evelynn main, nor do I play any jungle at all.)   (P.P.S. For anyone that is curious enough, I like playing ADC/Support, see in:   (
0	I have crohn's. I once ran into what I thought was an empty bathroom, went to a stall and just let loose. After the flood was over, I hear this girl in another stall awkwardly sniffling and telling someone on the phone that she'd call them back. She was crying on the phone to someone. I felt kinda bad about that one.
1	Sometimes I counter jungle, but usually what happens for me is to try a gank anyways.  If you do get it, great.  If not, you denied your enemy some farm/xp, putting your laner ahead, even if just a little.  Who knows, the chunk of health you took off them coud be the difference later in a 1v1.  To me, a successful gank is one where no allies die, or are forced to back.  If they burn flash or ghost to get away, mission greatly accomplished.
0	i find meaningless conversation just that, meaningless. why drone on and on a topic that neither party has direct control over. Get an idea out of me, don't use me as your excuse to inflate your ego or up talk something i clearly have no opinion on.
1	I really really fucking wish riot would follow a major corporation in terms of how to do releases and patches. Especially for things on the server side.   The amount of bugs that are released with every patch even though they have PBE is just horrendous. They NEED to make sure the environment of PBE is EXACTLY THE SAME as release and work with that. Edge case bugs are hard to find, that I understand. However, server connection issues, fps drops, client bug, etc. Anything that is general and wide-spread SHOULD have been caught before release. If it is game breaking enough (like a day or two ago when League was unplayable) they need to roll back the patch.
1	For being someone who played a lot Nautilus top, i dont recommend it. You're able to trade well only when your shield is up, and in laning, it gets destroyed quite fast. You build tanky ? Useless dmg, condemned to lose the lane. You build dps ? You'll be depoped and cant use your cc at their maximum efficiency.   You especially dont wanna lane against ranged champs and late game champs. You dont want early trades cause you'll be squishy. Even fed, you wont be able to be a big deal to your opponents. Nautilus top doesn't bring enough utility to his team compared to the dmg he wont bring, unlike a Maokai or a gragas.
1	Wukong can become really tanky without the need of stacking armor and magic resistance. With his passive and masteries alone you can get around 140 armor and 110 mr by the passive and masteries alone. So what you want to focus on is building things that gives armor penetration like black cleaver and last whisperer, but a tank item that is very useful is is randuins.  With randuins activated you will slow enemies inside your ultimate so you can succesfully hit with your ultimate 100% on the priority target.  If you need magic resistance then Banshee's veil would be good, it helps you get into a fight without getting knocked away, slowed or being stunned.
0	I had always wanted to randomly follow someone and when I found out a few of my friends had done it I immediately knew I had to try it. So this time we all piled into my car and started driving around at midnight looking for cars to just follow. We did this a few times over the course of about an hour, pretty uneventful, until we decided that we'd follow one more car before going home. So this guy catches on pretty quick, we made it obvious, we wanted the chase! We're banking turns trying to keep up with this guy until he goes into a run down neighborhood with cars parked on both sides of the street (so it's essentially a one way. This car starts to slow down.   Fuck.   So this would be the part to mention how we're all gigantic wimps. Everyone starts freaking out as we realize this is a dead end. The car we're following starts to turn around at the end of the road. I put the car in reverse, look over my shoulder, and haul ass to the intersection, swing the car around, and gun it. After two random turns I realize I fucked up.   Dead end.   Fuck.   Shut the car off, turned off all the lights, nobody moves. We see the car go past the street we turned into. Waited a few minutes before turning the car back on and driving home.
0	My mother could have abused me to no end but losing her still would have made the empty hole I feel today without her.   This is one thing that I will never understand. If a mother abuses her child and pretty much ruins his childhood why would she deserve his love?  My mother have done a lot of fucked up things to especially me but my brothers as well. She left me many miles away from home when I was 12 with nothing in my pockets and I had to hitchhike with strangers to get home. She basically brain washed me to thinking that my dad is a monster. And she told me I was fat all my childhood which caused me to suffer anorexia nervosa for over 3 years and she blamed it on my older brother for being a vegetarian. She threw me out so many times that lost count and she was violent.  I'm sure that she is mentally ill (although she would never admit it or even agree to see a doctor) but she knew what she was doing. Whenever someone outside of the family was around she would act like the most loving mother ever and it made me sick.   I moved far away from my family at 17 (I am now 19) and even though I miss the rest of my family, I've never felt this free. There are many times that I cry in my bed, calling out for "mama" meaning the mother that I feel is missing from my life but I know that she will never come.   Just because you brought a child to this world does not mean that they should love you no matter what. Act like a loving mother and you will get that love. When I tell people about her almost everyone will respond "But she's still your mother so you must love her, right?" No. Why would I have any positive feelings towards anyone who fucked me up like she did, mother or not?   Sorry about the novel but that really offended me so I wanted to share my story.

1	APs don't scale as well into lategame because all of our items are so much cheaper now. The stats reflect this, and even when you do well and get money there's very little to spend it on that's worth more than 3K gold. To get much lategame scaling at all on a nuker you need to either get Deathcap+Zhonya's+DFG, or just play Veigar.   Furthermore, I don't see how it's possible for Riot to make itemizing any more "fresh and appealing" because when you play AP you're basically just stacking one number as high as possible, Your Ability Power. There aren't a whole bunch of ways to make this fun with the items unless you want a confusing array of actives to keep track of.   That being said, I find AP much more fun to play because you don't just Point-and-click to attack things. You have to order combos and aim skillshots. Doing this perfectly is a more satisfying experience than autoattacking/QQ-ing someone to death as Caitlyn or Gangplank if you ask me.   In terms of more and more bruisers going mid... Well AD Midalee is a bitch. Often I want to go back to the days of being against Orianna or Brand every single game, when the meta was predictable and could be intelligently countered instead of a hotchbotch of ADs and APs going mid. These are turbulent times.   However, if bruisers do so well in mid, why not just play them? I enjoy playing fun AD casters like Zed from time to time and it makes a nice change from fighting Orianna every other match like the end of S2. What Riot has done is destabilize the meta quite effectively and as such (in my experience) people are playing "All-Round" hybrid characters like Nidalee and Teemo just to make sure that all roles are fulfilled.   I'm sure the Meta will settle someday, and we'll all be comfortable again.

Women want a man, not a suck up pansy.  Believe me I have tried the whole do more for her thing,  it will just make you mad unless you actually talk to her and say I do X to get sex.

For example i never get flamed if i'm carrying. lol.
0	where does it say this?? Not your verse...   1:27?   In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed shameful acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their error.   again, Bible condones gay sex (like every other types sex), never for loving another man. Even then the rest of the verse talks about other sins as well, it never isolated homosexuality as THE sin. Even the verse that talked about gay sex is in the same paragraph as unnatural sex. In the Bible, anything other than 1 to 1 penis to vagina is considered unnatural. so that includes hetero-anal   I checked out the whole ch.1 of Romans,

It felt like Satan was sucking my dick and my pubes were fire ants. I tried dunking my dick in the toilet to alleviate the pain but it was no use. Finally I resorted to sticking my dick in a tub of pistachio ice cream, which actually worked.
1	Reddit: "OMG Vayne too powerful, 3 steroids give way too much damage."   Riot nerfs everything but her steroids   Reddit: "OMG Vayne is so bad, terrible character, Sivir new OP."   You guys really think that Vayne is at a huge disadvantage now that she only has a little more movespeed than anyone she's laning against instead of 40-50 more movespeed than a given ranged AD or Support? Her base values are still going to be fine in lane, especially compared to the slow movers she's laning against.   They changed aboslutely nothing about her late game damage, they just changed her stealth so she can't 1v4 people. Oh noes, now Vayne has to play like  any other ranged AD  where she stands behind her team and does damage rather than running in on her own against their whole team.   She still does far more damage than any other ranged AD at the end of the game. Forcing her to play like every other character in her class doesn't even  begin  to render her underpowered.
1	Wall of useful information. Enjoy. :)   RECALLING   Choosing when to recall is very situational. The basic concept is: Will I die if I stay here? If the answer is yes, it's probably a good idea to recall. It's worth a 30 second trip back to lane versus potentially double that. Risk verse reward. Also it is a good idea to try to recall for a core purchase like Infinity's edge or an early B.F. sword. I say try because as long as you stay stronger , you can stay longer and come back with even more items instead of just buying the B.F. sword. This is just a general idea around recalling.   PUSHING MINIONS   Pushing the minion wave is a very fun tool once you learn how to command your minions. When pushing there are several reactions that can happen: Your opponent starts taking more minion damage when he trades you. Your opponents will either become more aggressive or more passive. Jungle pressure increases on your lane. Mid lane pressure becomes higher. Top lane tp ganks will become higher. (Only applies frequently in some elo's) Your opponent will lose creeps to tower. You may want to take their tower for global gold and dragon control. You may want pressure in your lane so your teammates can catch up in exp and gold.   OP SKILLZ   A great skill to master after knowing when to push is: CS'ing while pushing. Doing this strategy will cause the opponent to lose CS by forcing him to race you or losing his minions to tower. The enemy team can also turn and fight you if they want so be careful. This only works on passive or weaker lanes, unless you are certain that you can outplay your enemies. (Outplaying your enemies means that you are stronger in the current moment; higher value items in terms of stats and effects, break point levels like 6, 11, 16, your own jungler presence (situational), summoner spells on yourself and your opponent, knowing where your jungler and mid are as well as your top lane, knowing where the enemy players are with wards and such, and much more.)   TRADING EFFECTIVELY   Ok first of all, you should just focus on being able to cs and not get out traded. To poke efficiently, you want to watch your own minions life. Because the enemy adc will auto attack a minion when it gets low, so you know when and where he will stand to shoot it. Kind of like you would predit what he would do based on what you would do if you were him. When he CS's, auto him and back up. You are backing up because you dont want him to hit you after you got a free shot off on him because he CS'd. Also you want to back up after hitting him to reset minion aggro off of you. This will save you a lot of health in the long run. There are a few things to consider when choosing one of these trades; How is he reacting to me before CS'ing, how strong item wise is he, where is his support, where is my support, etc.   PHANTOM VS SHIV   There are so many different ways to justify each of these items but mostly it comes down to personal preference. Static shiv is used primarily to push waves, clear jungle a bit faster and poking with shiv procs. Phantom dancer is used for quick auto's and taking objectives quickly. Both are arguably equally useful in team fights.   RUNES, MASTERIES, AND MUCH MORE   For runes and masteries, I would find out what Gosu uses and copy him. (Sorry to busy with writing this heap of literacy to be bothered to look them up. ;)) For item builds, always build the same 5 items every game. The 6th item can be bought whenever you want and it is a situational item.   CONCLUSION /
0	Stupid? Now if someone told her beforehand and she did it anyway, that's stupid. But not knowing beforehand? That's ignorance not stupidity. You can't get mad at someone for being ignorant because they don't usually have control over it. I never knew tattoo's like that were a thing in the holocaust until this thread. You calling her stupid is similar to calling me stupid. Are you saying that I'm stupid because I've never come across this before? No one ever told me about it and I can't do research on something I don't know about.

Then there are people who literally just have applications out for UE reasons or are mooches and don't even show up to interview.

Nobody actually wants to work except for a few who enjoy it.

0	Not all teenagers are violent assholes!   Me & my friends play football (saccar) outside my house a lot. The ball is kicked off a fence, and there's other people nearby, so sometimes they'll want us to quieten down. Specifically, 3 guys. All around 40 years old in different houses.   Guy #1 usually comes out with a knife, threatening to call the police and he'll pop our ball if it goes anywhere near him. He swears at us and is just generally an asshole.   Guy #2 usually comes out and just asks us if we can quieten down or move somewhere else. He seems a little annoyed, but nice at the same time.   Guy #3 comes out shouting at us, threatening to kick all our asses if we don't get the hell out of there.   Guess which guy we normally listen to? Yep. Only #2.   With guy #1, we just end up hating him. Some of my friends try specifically to annoy him, and the only thing we do when he comes out is just keep playing or wait til he goes away.   With guy #2, we normally respect him and try to leave/be quieter. I mean some of my friends will still say stuff like "What a grumpy asshole!!", but most of us like him and listen to him.   With guy #3, we just laugh it off. A 40 year old guy is going to come out here and kick our asses? 1 vs 5? That's an empty threat if i ever heard one. We're going nowhere.
0	See, you can say this in almost any other context and your opinion would have to be accepted as valid, because, well, there are more Christian denominations out there than stars, and they all reserve the right to interpret things slightly differently from everyone else. That said, the Philippines is 80-85% catholic and ~93% Christian. Roman Catholicism has Very well defined views on the nature of contraception, and they do not consider it to be murder.  Islam is the second largest religious demographic there, ranging from ~5-11% depending on who you ask, and, by any mainstream interpretation of the Quran and relevant Hadiths does not consider contraception murder. Some interpretations of Islam consider it to be sinful, but no interpretation of Islam sees it as murder.^1 The third largest group is a filipino christian denomination called 'Iglesia ni Cristo' which makes up just over two percent of the population and recently publicly indicated its support for contraception.^2   In other words: one or maybe even many of the few hundred protestant denominations with a foothold in the Philippines may believe that contraception is murder, but even if every single protestant in the country suddenly converted to this theoretical sect, they would make up 11% of the population at maximum, and it's Very unlikely to be the case that as soon as a denomination takes one step away from Rome or a weird indigenous cult they'd suddenly hate condoms with the white hot intensity of a thousand suns.
1	Solcrushed if you're still around answering questions I have an issue.   It sounds like these jungle changes don't do anything for the ganking jungler. Right now it feels like when I play a very good early game as a ganking jungler and take all the kills I've just hamstrung my entire team. I lack the ability to take my lead and turn it into something great.   Late game I never have gold because I can't farm, I can't farm during the mid game and I can't farm early, I will always have less power than my team no matter what. Is Riot saying the only way around this is to fully commit to farming the jungle? It looks like the only jungler gold benefits are to dedicated farmers. Every time I read a change it's another nerf to the heavy gank playstyle, and now I hear that individual camps give less so I'm further penalised for taking camps on the side after ganks.
1	Honestly some people are going to tell you to try to carry the game with "carry" champs or "practice more". After climbing to high plat on multiple accounts the one thing i'm sure of is that every low elo player underestimates the power of TEAMWORK. I know this is the cheesy answer and it's easier said than done, but one day you will look back when you're gold/plat and realize the insane amounts of selfish decisions you made at low elo and how they seemed like a good idea at the time but in reality they cause you to lose.   When you are playing try to consciously think of what you should be doing as a TEAM! Always act as a team, try not to react to the other team (especially when you are ahead).   Also I realize that a lot of the time it's hard to work as a team when your teammates don't want to, but if you personally work on it, that's the biggest thing to set you apart from other low elo players, and mechanics are important too but that just comes with time.   Sorry if this post is really sloppily formatted I just threw it together real quick, hope I could help.

0	Story time Mofos,   Let me set the scene for you. The weather is cold enough to make a polar bear wear a sweater. The time of the finals has arrived.   1 week before the final, our esteemed professor proclaims that students who failed the midterms and are at an average for the quizzes should not bother coming to write the exam. They will fail the course unless they pull a 92 percent in their final. The midterms weighed in at 20 and 25 percent respectively and the quizzes weighed in at 10 percent total. The rest was the final. The passing grade for this course was a C-.   Now there is jerry (not his real name ofcourse). Jerry was what you would call a carefree individual who simply ran out of fucks to give the day he was born. Jerry had impressively failed both the midterms and was below average on the quizzes. Even a curve would not help his sorry ass.   Jerry who I had a distinct pleasure of being friends with, looked at me and said. " Motherlode, I dont want to repeat this course". I looked at him and explained to him that there is no way he is going to pass. He looked at me and said the single most glorious thing I have ever heard. "watch me".   End of class, he walks upto the professor and explains his situation. The professor explains to him that it is downright impossible for him to pass, there is no way it is happening. Jerry takes a deep breath and then there is silence in the air. You could feel it, The tension between two titans. Jerry looked up and said. "Professor, I know I am going to fail but would you care to make a wager". The professor curiously inquires, "what wager, jerry".   Jerry wagers that if he gets a 100 on 100 on his exam, the professor will give him a solid passing grade and if he fails well he fails. The professor with a smirk on his face says, "I will do you one better, get a 100 on 100 on the exam and I will give you an A+. I will transfer over the weightage from your midterms and quizzes to your final". Jerry, without hesitation agrees.   The whole final week, I promise you with my life, Jerry was out drinking, playing games and just aimlessly browsing youtube ( a favorite past time of his, He claimed that he once found a porno on youtube). He used to have his headphones on all the time listening to what he called "vocal trance"   On the day of the final, a 3 hour one, we are sat down at predetermined spots and the exam commences. It was no easy exam, it was harsh. Required a lot of analytical thinking, it required a lot of calculation. It was after all a calculus 2 exam.   At the sound of the one hour mark, Jerry raises his hand and says he is done. The whole room turned around to look at this mad man. This mad human being had finished a 3 hour exam in under 1 and that too without his calculator (he claimed that his calculator had lost its digits).   For a week I pestered him into telling me how it went, all he said, "time will tell my friend".   When the results came around, Jerry had received an email from the prof and said he needed to see him. When Jerry came back, I asked him what happened. He said well he had to give me an A+. I aced that bitch. He(the prof), just did not believe it was possible but commended him after Jerry proved to him that no illegal methods were used when he gave the test. I looked at him and asked how he did it, what was his secret to learning everything so quick without actually learning.   He looked at me and said, "that is my secret, I am always learning". Remember the vocal trance he said he was listening to. Well turns out Jerry had collected a massive library of audio recordings and digital lectures and was listening to them non stop. He was learning while partying. This mofo, never stopped learning.   I know the story seems far fetched but it truly happened before my eyes. A lot of people find it hard to believe and I dont blame them but I have used his methods and found out that I have an easier time in courses now than before.
0	As someone who overcame this same challenge, I think /u/Ascian5 has the best advice. Ask questions to get people talking about themselves, and if they're a nice thoughtful person they will ask you questions about yourself, too. Then you can also remember things they told you and ask them about the same thing later. But as someone said below do NOT pepper people with a million questions. That will become awkward seal.   Other advice that worked for me is reading the news, particularly related to any topics they might discuss at lunch, or common interests that you have with everyone else. So if they talk about movies read about movies. Then you can just bring up a story you've heard ("Hey did you hear they announced that Starry McStarson is going to be in Big Budget Box Office Disappointment"). That should get them away from telling personal stories, at least for a bit.   At some point you're going to have to talk about yourself. I HATE talking about myself as we'll but it's just a reality. Maybe think out some SFW stories from the weekend and if anyone asks you'll have that ready to go.   Finally, I found for me that part of my paralysis in conversations was due to a lack of confidence, and when I exercised and lost weight I had much more confidence, and could chime into conversations more easily. If you are able to exercise more that might help, but once again that is what worked for me.
0	This comment will probably go unnoticed, but here goes anyway.   I'm a woman who spent 3 and 1/2 years of my early 20's in an abusive relationship. The guy was charming as fuck (as abusers tend to be) and I was young, naiive, and fell hard for him. I once went to a support group where it was said, "the abuser doesn't show up on the first date and punch you in the face." They work their way up to that, slowly whittling down your self-confidence and undermining you and brainwashing you until you actually believe that you're deserving of the treatment.   If you'd asked me about abusive relationships before then, I would have told you that I'd never put up with that kind of treatment, that if I was ever in that situation, I'd just leave.   Speaking from personal experience, trying to leave can be one of the most dangerous things you can try to do. Abusers need to be in control of their victims, and if you threaten to disrupt that control, they freak the fuck out. I've had my computer smashed, my clothes cut up, and my dog nearly choked to death, not to mention getting pretty much raped and beat up on a daily basis.   When my abuser was warping my mind and brainwashing me, he also cut me off from most of my friends and all of my immediate family. They probably all saw and knew what I was going through, but I was blind to it, because I was in love, and because "I could change him, I know I could."   So for 3 and 1/2 years, I stayed with him, biding my time, fighting back when I could, calling the cops when I could, and knowing I would probably end up dead one of those days. I finally ended up getting away from him, and it's been almost 4 years of freedom now. I actually have a friend who is going through an abusive relationship herself, and it's nearly impossible to get through to her, because of the garbage her boyfriend is spewing at her all the time.
1	I look for people to explain their thoughts and why they are doing what they are doing. It allows me to look for those situations in my own game and integrate it into my own play. Explain stuff that may seem obvious to you. One example I have from when I was learning to play AD well is that you shouldn't try to fight when their creeps outnumber yours or when they have a siege creep in early levels, and should push an engagement when you have creep advantage (if you are playing a lane that wants to go aggressive). So for how this would translate to stream, you would explain what you are looking for to go aggressive, point out that what you are looking for has happened, and then execute so people can see how well it works. This is just for AD, but I'm sure there are things like that for every role and that is what I look for in streams.
1	No I agree that the difference in mechanical skill between high golds to low diamond is can be minute. Imo there are three types of diamonds:   1) High mechanical skill, stomps lane to diamond   2) Good map awareness/control, takes objectives to diamond   3) Diamonds who can do both and actually climb past diamond 4   Well, I'm just a lowly plat myself and can't climb atm due to school (or maybe I can't because I'm bad. w/e), but I believe this is the case talking with diamond friends and playing with/against them.   Anyways, my point in that post was that bronze players and perhaps silver don't know how to play the game yet generally. For example, to write a good book you also need a decent vocabulary and grammar. Players of all elo can say that have the vocabulary aspect of league down through theorycraft. However, if these players don't know the essentials of laning (grammar in my analogy) such as not taking free harass,  last-hitting,  positioning yourself in lane to react to ganks,  last-hitting,  to understand when to push or b depending on the enemy jungle's position.... Most gold players understand the basics of this in their play, even if not on a cognitive level. This may sound pretentious, but until players generally conceptualize how to play league on this level, I don't think they should worry about being innovative because it won't matter since they can't pull it off. I'm not trying to bash low elo players but I think it's safe to say that they just haven't learned the basics of the game yet.
0	I can't help but notice how OP views the problem as a lack of respect for him instead of a lack of respect for his girlfriend's comfort and boundaries. Sexual assault prevention so often becomes more about respecting the guy to whom a woman belongs than about respecting the woman. Because somehow it's easier to be mindful and respectful of another dude's perceived property than the boundaries of a woman, since the later requires recognizing women as a human being.
1	Well my story is something like this: Started season 2 by not playing ranked almost at all. About 4 months passed with me just playing normal games and just playing the game for fun.   A few more months passed and I started watching the "pro's" play (hotshotgg most notably), which inspired me to start playing rankeds. I mostly played support janna for starters as all my friends told me that it was one of the easiest and strongest supports. As i won a few games and gained more confidence on my skills I started playing other classes.   A few months later I found myself in 1300-1400 elo, where I was stuck for a long time. I was mostly playing top/jungle/support only.   It was only recently when I really got inspired to get that gold status. So I played the strongest champs I could find, which were for me Kennen, Malphite, Shen, Alistar, Graves, Maokai. Eventually I  reached my goal 1500 elo and passed even further to 1630 max elo where I sit at the moment. It was a journey for me where I developed as a player in many ways.   The thing about soloqueue in my mind is setting goals for yourselves and having the right mindsetup to achieve the goals. Communicate with your team and support each other. As a jungler it is very important to help the lanes that are losing. Oh and make sure you know the champions you are going to play in rankeds. Play a lot of normals to know your skills.   For next season im going for plat...
0	So if you are driving down the road, a police officer should be allowed to stop you just to check your identification to see if you're legally allowed to drive a car?   Delaware v. Prouse, 440 U.S. 648 (1979), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that police may not stop motorists without any reasonable suspicion to suspect crime or illegal activity, to check their driver's license and auto registration   A police officer asking you for your personal ID is considered a search by the Fourth Amendment, and they cannot stop you and search your ID unless they can provide specific facts that you are or are about to commit a crime. Simply carrying a weapon where it is legally permissible does not constitute reasonable suspicion to conduct a search. In the same sense that driving a car where you are legally allowed to drive the car does not give the police the authority to stop you and demand you ID yourself.
1	Well it's a small lane, mid lane, then there's also the fact that he can ride the minion wave pretty well, so there's not a lot of outrunning to do. The main thing I do to yasuo, is play off the weakness of his Q cooldown at early levels. Most people think he's OP because he can just knock you up & all in you with ease, but actually it's pretty hard in most cases. If you give a solid line of minion wave & standing a fair distance away from tower, he's going to stack E & walk up to you & auto+knock up you down before hitting you with the max damage E. On the flip side, if you shove his lane & start harassing him, Yasuos tend to slip up & miss the knock up(if they have it) & it takes around 40 seconds before they are able to throw another one.
1	I have never once been raged at for what I build or play. More often than not it's an issue of how you are playing and people will call you out if its not working. You start stacking BTs on lissandra and feed horribly and people probably won't like that. Every player in this game likes to point fingers at someone else for why they are losing. If you happen to be building something really strange and aren't doing well because of it, 9/10 times they'll point at you.
0	I had a friend who was diagnosed with ADD. Really smart kid, wasn't having problems with school or anything. Always had time for his numerous hobbies while doing great on homework. Anyway, he was diagnosed and was skeptical but decided to try the meds and go from there. He likes the extra sharp focus it gives him and now insists he knew he was ADD because he "found background noise distracting."
0	Fool proof eh?   I'm not much for gambling in vegas.  Betting my money on the chance the Casino is going to grant me my luck is something i've never been into.  I'd like to think I can create my own luck.  It started in 1987; I remember walking out of the movie theatre thinking, "damn...greed...is good."  Well, like most things during the 80's I probably missed the point.  The lavish life style, the feeling of absolute control.  "That could be mine!"  As it turns out, I was also graduating from college that year and I felt somewhat obligated to use the chemistry degree I just spent thousands on.  So, I ended up teaching at a private high school containing my inner broker to trading as a hobby.  I eventually settled down and became a father so I didn't really have any money to risk.  I guess I kind of blamed my son for ending that dream.  Every time I looked at him, I saw the final nail in the coffin that contained my million dollar apartment and brand new S550.   It wasn't healthy. I got the sense that he could feel the resentment as well.  As he got older I found myself with a little bit more money and started dabbling in the game again.  I found now that I've been working at the school for 14 years I could really devote as much time as I want and put no effort into teaching.  My son had been trying to connect with me, I felt bad for him too.  He knew trading was my interest and so anytime I was on the computer looking up stocks he'd be there over my shoulder.  Wasn't the brightest kid in the world, but he just wanted to make me proud.  I'd even give him the login information to my Schwab account so he could browse around and read some of the articles.  By this time there were a few stocks I'd been looking at.  It was 2001, and like the rest of the country I'd been astonished at one  particular companies performance for the past few years.  Like usual I did my research and kept an eye on it.  It was March 8th 2001, and I had been debating whether or not I should go in.  The stock had been at 70 and it looked to go only up.  I decided that if I was going to make a move I'd be ready.  That day I transferred my sons college fund over to my Schwabb account and over half of my savings.  I should have told my wife but I couldn't picture anything but good things to come.  I came home early that day and I say at my computer debating.  Is this the day? I should take the risk, why not? Did you see their profit?  On March 9th 2001, the stock took a little dip but nothing it wouldn't bounce back from.  It seemed just right, it was a little down, good time to strike.  The weekend came and I was still tormented by the decision.  Sunday was March 11th.  I had to make my choice.   I set my alarm for 3:00am.  I sat at my computer desk to not wake my wife and passed out.  I suddenly awoke too, "break on through," and I grabbed a pen and paper and wrote my decision down.   I shut the alarm off and went upstairs.  I woke up a little late for work and I hurried out the door.  I left the piece of paper on my desk.  I remembered what it said but I still had the car ride to think it through.  It was March 12th 2001.   My son stayed home sick from school that day.  He wandered into my office and saw the note on my desk.  This was the moment the little fool could make me proud.  He was so excited to tell me he managed to buy the stock for me.  He would finally earn respect from me.   I spent the car ride thinking in my head.  Those numbers make no sense.  I shouldn't buy.  I shouldn't do it. It's too much money.   By the time I got home the market had closed. I heard on the radio that the stock dropped 10 dollars.  I was relieved I didn't follow through with that decision.  I pulled into my driveway and opened the door.  My son ran too me and pulled me to the office.   That fool.
0	Of course, this is also when "choose the most correct answer" comes into play, and somehow A was more correct than B, thus, choosing either C or D is wrong.   Yes, it seems blatantly obvious what the teacher intended. It doesn't solve the problem that we're sweating bullets during exams and really rather not have to figure out whether you're fucking with us or just slipped and made a mistake.

0	internet couch lawyer here" If you go to the meeting because you are a alcoholic. Then he fired you because of it. Then yes you have been discriminated against. Handicap is one of the federal protected groups that can not be legally discriminated against with out facing a lawsuit you can't win as an employer. You fire on performance never cause he was drunk at work. If you fire because he's a drunk you are required to put your employee through rehab at the employers expense.
0	Haha wow. Okay thanks. I'm a janitor because I decided engineering wasn't for me. I'm just doing this until I figure out what I want to do. I won't be doing it forever but I sure am glad I decided to. I bet I have a better life than you do. I'm happy where I am.
0	so just the other day i was parked like an asshole. i normally don't park like an asshole but today i needed to give a guy at work a boost who was stuck at a mall. so to make sure the cables made it all the way across i.. you guessed it, parked like an asshole! i then leave, grab a coffee, come back and get into my van to notice that a guy has parked beside me and is now returning to the vehicle. i wave to him, give a nice "sorry dude! needed to boost a friend!" and he just started screaming about my shitty parking job, that i'm an asshole, i'm an idiot, that i drive a minivan(excellent observation) etc. now i hate anyone who owns a white KIA. i should've punched him.  was the better man... regretted it.
1	Dont give a shit about bad losing sprees and stuff. Dont moan too much, man it up and move on. Dont be a bitch about teammates and dont cry after first 2 kills like "gg surr 20 its lost" etc.
0	One early Easter weekend morning (~ 6:30 am?) while working at a gas station I'm sitting there doing a crossword and eating a 'liberated' *Rolo ice cream bar when I had a regular customer come in, quite drunk, and asks to use the phone. I say, sure, why not. I normally don't let the sketchbags in the area use the phone (or have free coffee), but this sketchbag gives me the heads up about other uber-sketchbags that might be doing sketchy things while I'm working and looks out for me when I do night shifts. It's a feel good sketchbag-symbiosis relationship we have.   Anyway, he gets on the phone and starts arguing with someone on the other end. Fuck this. Fuck that. Fuck you. Etc. After a couple of minutes of that he hands me the phone back, thanks me politely and leaves. Fast forward like 15 minutes later when he comes in and asks to use the phone again. Oh, as a side note we used to have payphones in the neighborhood but crackheads kept taking or breaking them. Now while he's on the phone I notice he's got these huge pair of scissors. Like...just massive. You could slice a sail in half with one snip huge. So he's on the phone screaming at whoever and telling them to come get him and that he'll fuck them up...when across the lot I can see some dude walking towards up yelling on his cell phone and carrying a big ol' knife. I say to the regular, hey man, I think you're friend's here to see you. He turns around, passes me the phone (thanking me politely again) and goes outside.   The two rush each other and meet under the gas pump canopy. They square off, then dart to the squeegees. Now equipped with a squeegee and a sharp thing they start trying to pelt and stab one another. I'm inside using the camera controls to zoom in while humming Duel of Fates. I probably  should  call the police, but this isn't any of my business so I'm staying out of it until someone goes down. They sketch-fence for a bit (even so far as taking it out into the completely quiet Easter morning street), until the newcomer with the bowie knife bails with the regular in pursuit (charging after him with the squeegee like its a battleaxe) and out of sight.   So i go back my crossword for a bit when the cops show up. They come in looking really perplexed because someone in the neighborhood saw the fight and thought we were getting robbed (the regular customer had a shirt the same color as our uniform shirts). They say, are you okay? I say yeah, why? Someone said you were being attacked. Oh, that? Yeah, I say, two guys were trying to kill each other outside the store but they ran off. S'all good guys. The cops look at me like I've got two heads. What did they look like? No clue. Maybe one had a black jacket. Where'd they go? No idea. Ummm...that way. Maybe? So they shake their heads and tell me if they come back to give them a call.   A few hours later the regular comes back with two broken squeegees and apologizes for breaking them. I say no problem man, happens all the time. We fist pump. I'll just tell the boss what I told the cops. I have no clue how they got like that.   I didn't ask what happened. The first rule of Squeegee Fight Club is you do not talk about Squeegee Fight Club.   And that's what happens to squeegees some of the time.   *Depending on the microwave you have available, take out of Rolo ice cream bar and pop it in the microwave for like, 15 sec. It melts the inside caramel warm but the ice cream and shell are still cold.  Fuckin' baller.
1	I thought about this today, but I've decided, not really.  I've been suffering from the major lag issues as of late.  Since I only play ranked, I find playing with inevitable lag to be a dumb move for someone wanting to hit Plat this season.  So I just haven't played at all (other than a bot game to get my first win money).  Over the past few days, I've been pretty depressed.  I don't really have any other games to play right now, and League's the only one I really enjoy playing.  It never gets old, and every game is something new.  But I also haven't really had a hard time NOT playing either.  I've got other things in my life that I'd like to do.  I've got a demo reel that needs to be finished by the end of 2013, so it's given me plenty of time to do the other things I enjoy.  The lags been gone for all of today, but I still haven't played.  I don't think you really understand what addiction means.  An addiction is a physical dependency caused by chemical imbalances (usually caused by chem. baring drugs).  The only way this can happen to a person through a game is through insane amounts of Serotonin dispersed at once.  This is incredibly rare to feel, being as our bodies are pretty well built most of the time.  The chances that you're addicted to the game physically, are slim to none.  No matter what CNN tells you.
0	One time a lady called on the phone when I was younger asking for my mother(I thought it was a telemarketer.. I told her that my mother was in jail and would be out in two weeks. ( she really wasn't) So about two weeks later we get another phone call from the same people, this time I said my mother was dead. About 3 weeks later I went to visit a friend from anorher state, and about 30 minutes after I got off the train I got a phone call from my dad asking me why the hell my grandparents got a request for a death certificate for my mother in the mail. Turns out it was the student loan company and I made a big mistake. They ended up needing to fill out a whole assload of paperwork to remove the death error in their system. So faking a death probably isn't the smartest :p
0	Indeed. As this illustrates, automation isn't the main issue in our society. The main issue is that the fruits of the automation are hoarded by a small class of capitalists, rather than shared with the wider society.   Scientific, artistic, and technological advancements are not the results of individual brilliance more than they are culminations of the societal and cross-societal collaborative efforts. The fruits of these advances should be shared more widely; not used as a tool to further disenfranchise those who labour for their living
1	I kinda approve, but challengers point is to have what top 100players there. So if you let more ppl to challenger it would be just like league after diamond not the top 100 players so the whole point gets ruined there. Also  you probably get out of 99 points cycle when you surpass someones MMR in challenger.
0	It's easy. She stuffed her tongue into someone elses mouth. So I stuffed anti-freeze in his gas tank and verbally assaulted her to tears as to how fucked up she was.  She tried to kill herself and I didn't care.  I'm not saying what I did was right, but it definitely got my point across. It's not that I don't care about her, but I just tend to burn bridges and sometimes those that are on the other side tend to get burned.
1	I feel like Nyph should be higher on this list. I think it wouldn't look like, you know, you only do this because he is on SK.  In my opinion, he is not only one of the best supports, he is one of the best player overall.  His playstyle, containing his huge overview and his calm nature (I never heard him raging even a little bit on stream), that all is making him to a perfect example what a good support can do for a team, just like you saw it on the IPL with b.e. Chauster.
1	Shouldn't have rushed the Spirit of Ancient Golem if the enemy team has a Katarina...   If it wasn't a straight rush (aka midgame) then you should have auxiliary MR items (Runic Bulwark's item tree comes to mind).   To be honest, a straight rush of the Spirit Stone upgrade items is actually not very optimal because part of the item's stats is only effective vs jungle creeps and not vs champions.   Mercury Treads have a combine cost of 850 gold from regular boots while the Negatron Cloak costs 810 gold total and offers 45 MR vs 25. Once again, Katarina has no cc.
0	Whoa buddy, slow down. Let me try and help you out here.   Every household needs equal input from both parties. They need to share the load of responsibility. This does not mean that JUST because you are a stay at home mom, you HAVE to be the one who does a majority of the cleaning, even though that is a traditional view.   Some relationships are built differently than others. And while it makes sense that the responsibility of domicile upkeep would fall on the person who spends a majority of their time in the home, different relationships will have different setups.
0	Am i the only one that thinks they are missing the point? Their 'motive' is to protect under 18's and they will spend millions on this. Before ignoring it by censoring it i feel the government should have sex ed actually taught to kids. Im 17 so fairly recently out of school per say, and i got litterally no sex ed. If kids understood it i dont think it would be an issue.   Edit:
1	Let me reply to your replies:   > This is also an inaccurate statement.   Obviously I can give nothing but innacurate statements since I have no access to riot's source code and such.

Said a guy with zero programs being used by millions world wide XDD  How do I know? Easy, because if you were to be working for a big company like Google/Microsoft/Apple/etc you would have started saying it.   > try not being so negative   Said the guy who started first saying:   > People just like to whine about it until it becomes a pitch fork mob. Or maybe you have a bad computer filled with malware that just crashes all the time   Also, about this:   > IDK, I have never had one single login error crash the client in the years I have been playing.   That only proves that you're not playing on EUW.
0	The circumstances were very weird, and this was one of many OAG things said. I'm not going to post the story, but
1	I was going to say the same. Soraka is such a strong support that she almost always gets played that way. However, I picked Soraka to support the other day, then a teammate who picked later also picked a support champ with CV, so instead of calling him a douche, I just played Soraka mage. I went mid. It was awesome. Her silence range is huge when it is one of her main AP nukes. I ended 16/0/17. It was disgusting.
1	absolutely awful concept and heres why.  over half the champs would be unplayable because how viable is jungle anivia and miss fortune! meaning players without all the champs are gonna be screwed in terms of picks.  then theirs the fact that pushing is near impossible since it takes twice as long to get to an enemy tower as it would to defend it meaning pushing is non existant.  every fight is impossible to do under a tower since it will be completely one sided each fight as a tower hitting 5 people is worse than on a singular target, unless u make it so the toweres do 20% of summoners rift towers each shot which is like 20 damage which is negligable.  then theirs the baron problem making baron fights impossible because, hey, this maps tiny and it wont take me 5 seconds to be responding.  and then theirs the problem of 5 smites making barons fucking unpredicatble because its "we have almost 4k true damage in 1 button press, who will get the baron".
0	Sounds like someone needs to GROW THE FUCK UP.  When you were unemployed and basically being a parasite and contributing nothing worthwhile to society, who paid all your bills?  Who bought you all the pot and video games you played?  Did you live off welfare and basically make EVERYONE ELSE take on responsibilities of keeping you warm fed and clothed? If so looks like you are just sad that you cant fucking mooch off anyone anymore.  Your happiness doesn't mean a God damned thing to anyone but you, do you think your hungry kids and wife care if your happier?
1	dont forget about the fact that MMR also keeps the enemy MMR in mind
1	They buffed his E by bug-fixing it. He'll still be really strong and do giant burst.   All the champions they nerfed will still be fine. They just wont be OP.   I play Evelynn a lot and I'm not crying about her Ultimate being nerfed so hard.   I mean, sure Talon's Q and R has lower base damage. But the bug-fix on his E means that all his attacks will now do 15% more damage, like they're supposed to, so it balances out reasonably well.   If you're literally in-capable of winning after the nerfs then that's more of an indicator of your skill level than Talon's viability.
1	Simply put, AD Kog is idiot proof. AP Kog relies on some of the harder(read slow0) skill shots in the game to do consistent damage. If you're alone, you're probably dead. If they're alone and have seen a Kog'maw before they're going to just dodge your ult and merrily run away.   That said, I love playing AP Kog as an alt to AD if the team has a slot for it, not to mention the awesome harass. Although as far as AP champs go, the popular choices are the ones that don't rely on nicely timed skillshots, or the enemy being distracted/just plain bad.
0	Story time. VZ customer service is GARBAGE. I had FIOS installed at my old apartment - got the triple play (even though i don't use the landline) because the package was cheaper than the 2 play - ok all good. Fast fwd to a year later, now I'm moving to another apt in the same building, try to get my service switched over. I ordered a triple play that was pretty much the same base cost (they didnt have the exact same promo available so i had to downgrade my internet speed - no biggie).   I get the bill estimate for my new contract - remember base cost was pretty much the same - with taxes it's like $50 more per month. The extra charges are NOT itemized on the estimate, they show up as "taxes, surcharges, and other VZ charges". I flip out and try to get answers from VZ. At least an itemized list of extra charges so I know why I'm bending over before they fuck me, right? I go through 5 different agents (phone and online) who all give me bullshit, but different forms of bullshit. It becomes a clusterfuck of no one being able to explain the extra charges but not knowing why and not being able to provide an itemized list until my first actual bill. So they wanted me to pay first and then contest.   Finally I got through to a person with half a brain and she explained that because the same triple play promo was not available, they were passing through a shit-ton of phone related taxes and charges - like $40 per month. So needless to say, at that point I canceled the triple play and went back to double play.
1	Riot, there's recently been a lot of people requestion RP for a drawing of something League related. I tried this, but it didn't work. Someone suggested UNINSTALLING THE FUCKING GAME THEN GOING OUT TO RAPE A HEDGEHOG, which I attempted. Thing is, the instructions weren't 100% clear, and it turns out that I now have a Hedgehog's penis attatched to my hard drive.
1	I wouldn't call this a "pointless feature" as some others are calling it. It can make champion select easier for some, particularly people like me who have all of the champions and play some roles they aren't tagged in (Such as lane kha'zix, jungle pantheon, support zyra, ect)   The "we have other features that are more important to add first" is a valid argument, but is aside from the point. It's a helpful feature many would appreciate.   Also, I HIGHLY doubt we are getting a "new" client as others are suggesting. I don't think we are going to migrate from adobe air anytime soon. It may appear new to us through new interfaces and such, but in the background, it will still be the same client. Even if much of the base is re-written, features like item/champion grouping or mastery pages likely have some sort of structure to them that allows them to be easily altered to fit the new system (relatively speaking).
1	I spent 15 minutes trying to get back into a game after the firewall error. According to my friend who was in the game, it never said I DCed. When I finally got reconnected to the game after 15 minutes, it gave me the pop-up saying I've been inactive and will now be booted. It counted those 15 minutes as AFK, not DC and so I was out of the game again! Hit reconnect and firewall error yet again.
0	ITT: What people think they would say in this situation.
1	I gotta say, she's not as strong in soloqueue as in organized team games. You may have an awesome record, but you can't help your lanes as much as other junglers. Therefore, you'll end up with a bunch of games in which you have a good personal record, but still lose.
1	What I've noticed is that the bans of many "average" tier solo queue players fall into a few categories that can be generalized pretty well.   That being said the most popular five bans I've seen these days are Shen, Alistar, Blitz, Malphite, and Morgana. The sixth ban has a little more wiggle room, I tend to ban out Amumu, but I also see plenty of diana, rengar, eve, and kass.   With most of these guys, the largest common denominator is that they have huge ganking potential. Many are mid-lane assassins that can shove lane and roam easily (diana, eve, kass) With the exception of blitz, the rest are hugely strong gankers themselves. Shen has a built in teleport, and amumu, alistar, malph, and morg have AOE cc that is hugely disruptive in teamfights.   Basically I think the assassin bans are always based on fear, rather than them actually being "op." Fizz, for example, deserves more credit as a midlane assassin that can win games practically by himself, and if a pro played him in a tourney with positive results he could probably become a flavor of the month.   As for the rest, it's hard to work around AOE cc. Even pros have trouble, and we've seen it in these finals. As an example with CLG.eu and WE focusing on who gets Orianna.   Sorry for the wall of text.
1	As an avid CLG.eu fan if I'm not mistaken CLG.eu tends to go turtle based comps such as anivia, and maokai, irelia(for some aggression incase they win the laning phase), and then they just farm for a while and wait for the perfect moment to fight in the late game and that one fight turns the game around pretty much, because the enemy team is dead for so long, they did this to M5 if I recall correctly a while back, I can't remember the match this was but I'll edit in if I find it.
0	To expand, its a specific story to an alien race about two men who were stuck on an island and survived by cooperating to fight a monster and became bros for life through this experience. The statement basically means that they want to forge a friendship, to be like Darmok and Jalad when they were stranded on the island of Tanagra. The thing is that their language is all about metaphor and historical reference so communicating means being able to see the meaning beneath the story being referenced.
1	I have never had a d/c where it wasn't riots fault, good news about this is when i dc i can just go surf the web. Don't QQ at players when it isn't there fault they are just trying to relax and play a game.
0	I appreciate your multitude of sources, but most of them seem to be pretty... awful.   The main contentions about aspartame (negatively, at least) are that 1) it increases tumor rate, 2) it increases blood concentrations of phenylalanine (which can be toxic in high levels, and is dangerous for phenylketonuretics), 3) it increases weight gain, 4) it generates formaldehyde.   Sources for #1 seem to suggest that there's no significant increase in tumor rates until you hit the absurd amount of 5g/kg body weight (unless their SEM is crazy low, but I didn't see errors shown). That'd be the equivalent of a ~140 lb person ingesting 300g of aspartame acutely, which would be roughly 100-150 cans/bottles of diet soda. The lowest data point I've seen with an increase obviously not caused by error is ~400mg/kg, or ~25g/10 cans of diet soda. Acutely, which would be over ~6 hours based on the experiment. The only thing this tells us is that obviously, consume aspartame in moderation, and unless you're drinking CRAZY amounts, you're probably safe.   For #2, increased phenylalanine concentrations... *(&%ing duh. Aspartame is a 2-amino acid molecule, it consists of one phenylalanine bonded to one glycine. The natural metabolic process here would be to split the two amino acids. Producing a free phenylalanine and a free glycine. In normal circumstances, the human body can deal with extra phenylalanine, so again in moderation there won't be an issue. However, phenylketonuretics lack the enzyme to process phenylalanine, so they shouldn't drink things with aspartame, as they should avoid anything with phenylalanine.   3 is a tricky one, it seems to be supported mostly by surveys and by animal trials. There's not really a suggestion of mechanism, as aspartame (and most artificial sweeteners aside from acesulfame) doesn't trigger an insulin response. Animals obviously aren't the best model for this if it's a psychological response. It's possible that people who drink more diet drinks are weaning off of non-diet, so they're more likely to be obese from all the delicious sugar. Or they're eating more because they believe "diet soda" means they're on a diet. Or there could actually be a physiological effect, I just don't think we have the evidence to say one way or the other yet.   The formaldehyde one is... peculiar. The only scientific study on it was the Trocho/Pardo/Alemany one that you linked. It's shit. I don't say that TOO often about research papers, but it's atrocious. Reading their discussion, they found roughly equal evidence both for and against their aspartame -> methanol -> formaldehyde -> adducts hypothesis, but were obviously biased towards supporting their own idea (which most of us scientists are, really). Their main assertion is that when they give animals C18 labeled aspartame, they find C18 in DNA and protein. But when they check DNA components that COULD do the 1-carbon transfer of formaldehyde from aspartame, they find no C18. Therefore, formaldehyde could not be the transfer mechanism. However, there are plenty of metabolic pathways that move carbons around, and there could be catabolism of the amino acids in aspartame and eventual anabolism into DNA bases. As for the protein assay, it's just... well, again, shit. They isolated amino acids and measured C18 content. So... they pulled out whatever C18 they'd just added in the aspartame anyway (remember, it's two amino acids, it's basically a tiny protein) and measured that. So the protein results are out.   Anyway, the science behind aspartame is really, really tricky. What we can really say for now is the same thing for everything; moderation is the key. Except phenylketonuretics. They should stay away from it.
1	So, here is a story.  When I first started league I played fiddlesticks a lot.  I remember I saved up 6300 for him then went to buy him and he was one of the cheaper champions.  I played mostly him until about level 20 when I quit for awhile.  That was at the end of season 1.  After a few months I kept getting a craving to play league.  I started playing again right when Xerath came out.  I like the look of him, so I bought him on release. Before this I had played a lot of champions due to their aesthetic.  I bought Galio because he was a golumn.  I bought Yorick because I wanted a little minion army to fight for me.  One of the reasons I bought Xerath however was because he was so long range and I wanted to begin playing in unlocked camera mode.  Anyhow, I then played him (Xerath) exclusively from level twenty well into level 30.  At this point I got a few of my friends into the game.  Now I have expanded my champion pool and I don't play him as much.  But from all my experience with him he is still one of mt best characters.  The End.  P.S. Now I play Zyra, and I am getting into Lux and Orianna.
0	From [A Brief Primer on Vampire Biology](   Homo sapiens vampiris was a short-lived Human subspecies which diverged from the ancestral line between 800,000 and 500,000 year BP. More gracile than either neandertal or sapiens, gross physical divergence from sapiens included slight elongation of canines, mandibles, and long bones in service of an increasingly predatory lifestyle. Due to the relatively brief lifespan of this lineage, these changes were not extensive and overlapped considerably with conspecific allometries; differences become diagnostically significant only at large sample sizes (N>130).   However, while virtually identical to modern humans in terms of gross physical morphology, vampiris was radically divergent from sapiens on the biochemical, neurological, and soft-tissue levels. The GI tract was foreshortened and secreted a distinct range of enzymes more suited to a carnivorous diet. Since cannibalism carries with it a high risk of prionic infection2, the vampire immune system displayed great resistance to prion diseases3, as well as to a variety of helminth and anasakid parasites. Vampiris hearing and vision were superior to that of sapiens; vampire retinas were quadrochromatic (containing four types of cones, compared to only three among baseline humans); the fourth cone type, common to nocturnal predators ranging from cats to snakes, was tuned to near-infrared. Vampire grey matter was "underconnected" compared to Human norms due to a relative lack of interstitial white matter; this forced isolated cortical modules to become self-contained and hypereffective, leading to omnisavantic pattern-matching and analytical skills4.   Virtually all of these adaptations are cascade effects that— while resulting from a variety of proximate causes— can ultimately be traced back to a paracentric inversion mutation on the Xq21.3 block of the X-chromosome5. This resulted in functional changes to genes coding for protocadherins (proteins that play a critical role in brain and central nervous system development). While this provoked radical neurological and behavioral changes, significant physical changes were limited to soft tissue and microstructures that do not fossilise. This, coupled with extremely low numbers of vampire even at peak population levels (existing as they did at the tip of the trophic pyramid) explains their virtual absence from the fossil record.   Significant deleterious effects also resulted from this cascade. For example, vampires lost the ability to code for -Protocadherin Y, whose genes are found exclusively on the hominid Y chromosome6. Unable to synthesise this vital protein themselves, vampires had to obtain it from their food. Human prey thus comprised an essential component of their diet, but a relatively slow-breeding one (a unique situation, since prey usually outproduce their predators by at least an order of magnitude). Normally this dynamic would be utterly unsustainable: vampires would predate humans to extinction, and then die off themselves for lack of essential nutrients.   Extended periods of lungfish-like dormancy7 (the so-called "undead" state)—and the consequent drastic reduction in vampire energetic needs— developed as a means of redressing this imbalance. To this end vampires produced elevated levels of endogenous Ala-(D) Leuenkephalin (a mammalian hibernation-inducing peptide8) and dobutamine, which strengthens the heart muscle during periods on inactivity9.   Another deleterious cascade effect was the so-called "Crucifix Glitch"— a cross-wiring of normally-distinct receptor arrays in the visual cortex10, resulting in grand mal-like feedback siezures whenever the arrays processing vertical and horizontal stimuli fired simultaneously across a sufficiently large arc of the visual field. Since intersecting right angles are virtually nonexistent in nature, natural selection did not weed out the Glitch until H. sapiens sapiens developed Euclidean architecture; by then, the trait had become fixed across H. sapiens vampiris via genetic drift, and—suddenly denied access to its prey—the entire subspecies went extinct shortly after the dawn of recorded history.
0	It is so easy to assume the person trying to get in is just some asshole.   The reality is that bumper to bumper traffic can get so long that by the time a driver sees a sign indicating that their lane is going to become a turn only lane for a turn they don't want to make or that they need to merge it is too late to get in at the back of the line in the lane adjacent to them.
0	Yeah I hated that. I worked at an afterschool program where my younger brother attended. He and one of his other friends would always ride home with me (because both their mothers are like "woot free ride."   Anywho, one day a mother was running late. I said that was fine, I will lock up and take them out to the playground until she gets here. When she showed up it was her daughter, my brother's friends, and my brother. She joked, "Other mom's running late too?"   I said no, I am taking them home. She just instantly looked mortified and started demanding they come with her. I tried to explain it was my brother but she kept saying ignore what he says come with her.   I had to call both of their mothers out there because she called 911. It was fucking ridiculous. The best part though is that, instead of apologizing, she pulled her daughter from our center.   Edit:
0	Please don't decide what everyone else's opinions are for them, that makes you no better than the people you dislike for deciding that your opinion is wrong.   EDIT:  I'll try to simplify it;   snap_wilson and Commander-Mander believe that nobody actually dislikes this song; they are just angry because they like it but are 'too cool' to openly enjoy it. They're annoyed by the fact people are saying this song is simply bad, and therefore undermining their own opinion.   The hypocrisy is that by saying this, they are undermining everyone else's opinion.
1	Most profesional teams have a map (a picture or a table usually) to plan strategies and lvl1s. I don't think neither you or him were the first ones to think of implementing it online. I would only consider it as stolen if he somehow used your design and changed trivial things.   Even if his inspiration to do it was your post, if he still created his web by himself I think it is completely fine. May the best (this includes making it public) one win.   In general, when millions or people are doing similar things, a decent number of them are going to be thinking the same ideas. That means that the value is in implementing the idea, nor the idea itself. Ideas are only valuable when the number of people is inferior (like in a top-level field of science, where only a few people in the world are working on).   Plus, if you share an idea, you have to be aware that other people may do it faster and better. They may even think that you have abandoned the project.
1	I don't think you know what being decent at something means. If you tell me half of the players currently playing ahri is decent at her you're really just dreaming, most of them picked her up cause she's popular and has no idea on how to play her. Also, what if there were 2 godlike urgot player, and only those 2 played urgot in the whole world? one wouldn't be decent cause he'd be the lower 50%? Not to mention you can get to gold by playing everything else, if you've never played her I doubt you can be considered decent at her.
1	Camp a lane if they are not warding. If your mid helps your gankings, it is ok but not necessary most of the time. Camp a lane and enemy laner will be dismoralized and his team will rage him. Counter-jungling can serve to this purpose well, but you need wards for counter-jungling.
0	This. I agree with you completely. My dad didn't go to college, and my mom did. They both work at my local school district. My dad is a custodian, my mom works in special ed (senior assistant in the district). He makes more than her, at about 14.50-ish an hour. Together, they make about 30k a year.   The only reason they can support us (3 kids) is because of government programs. For the longest time, they were full of pride, and wouldn't take charity. When the economy tanked, and we lost our house, they finally caved in.   We afford rent because the house is owned by my grandparents. We eat because of foodstamps and the local foodbank; and when school is in session, free breakfast/lunch. With sports, we have to work off our fees. We have to go with a private donation fund for athletes to get soccer shoes, or the like. Yet, are we a drain on society?   My mom works with special ed kids. She is on the high and middle school PTOs. She spends most of her time volunteering for them, or for other community events. My dad works as a custodian. While he just got switched to nights to keep his job, when he did work days he gave away most of his time. He coached soccer, basketball, softball, was involved in the high school PTO, volunteered at most sporting events, and still managed to make it to nearly every game/play/concert.   Then there is my siblings and I. They have great grades (3.9 and 4.0), though they are only in middle school. They are both 3 sport athletes. One is involved in band, one in choir.   Meanwhile, I am a Junior, top of my class. I am the youngest in my year, because I skipped a grade (1/2 7th, 1/2 8th). I am taking the hardest classes available, and am actively working with the community college to visit other schools, and seek scholarships. I am a member of my school's ASB (Associated Student Body) government, being the IT Director. This is my 2nd year doing it. I was until this year, involved with soccer (injured, lost will to play), have been involved with the drama department (plays + musicals. Will be acting in the play this fall, and backstage work for the musicals). I am also the wrestling team manager/stats person. I am one of two programmers for our robotics team. I also attend all home softball games, and the away games that I can. It was neglected for many years, and is now being rebuilt. In a place that rains a lot, I spent a lot of time in the rain, running the score clock. On top of that I have  a job working at a local radio station during live coverage of games plugging ads, and reffing youth soccer games every Saturday in the fall, four games a day, in the rain (8-1ish).   We are all outstanding members of the community, and would not be so without government aid.   Edit:
1	If the rest of your team is doing poorly, I'm not going to sugar coat it, some of those games you cant win unless your adc is ahead. Aside from that, playing support is about positioning and being able to make plays. There are blitz games that I've won where my team was doing poorly, my adc was doing well, and I just ran around making hooks and climbed ourselves back into the game.   You need to understand when you're ahead as a support and position according, whether it be gold, jungler presence or your minion wave larger than theirs. Noticed those small factors can turn an engage in your favor.   Something I liked to do with Blitz is look for a low minion that my ADC is about to last hit and see if the enemy ADC is standing behind it then toss out a hook right when he kills it. Keep in mind tho, thresh is not just about being able to land hooks in lane, sometimes a good flash flay while using a lantern to pull in your jungler is all you need. Then using the hook after they flash.   Hope this helps
1	I haven't been following LoL for very long (since about mid S3) and I have to say, the first time I heard about/saw some analysis from Monte I thought "oh, this guy seems to know what he's talking about. He seems to be well informed on the Korea scene and wants to see it applied in NA". then I found out he's the coach for a team, okay that makes sense. Then I found out he's a caster for OGN, hmmm, that seems odd considering the time differences.... Then I found out he lives in Korea: Wat. How do you coach an NA team if you live in a different continent??
0	Both sides hate her. I consider myself slightly right wing and she makes us all look like cross burning homophobes.
1	I didn't realize that the fanbases of League of Legends were concentrated around Taiwan and Singapore. If my memory serves me correctly the demographic for League of Legends' player base is heavily centered around China and Korea, hence the greater amount of money sponsors are willing to throw into their scenes.   Plus, this is Inven. Sorry that a Korean site is not reporting about people from other countries.   EDIT: And wait a second, "consoling" Koreans? First of all, one thread on Reddit highlighting a problem is  NOT  consoling anybody. It's just highlighting a story that's been going on in a website many American's can't (or don't) read. Second of all, the thing here is that, prior to this announcement, fans in Singapore and Taiwan weren't expecting anything out of the S4 Worlds in their region. If the entire thing was held in Korea then they wouldn't have any reason to be angry or disappointed because the option wasn't even discussed as being on the table. If the entire thing isn't held in Korea, then Koreans have every right to be angry and disappointed because having all of S4 Worlds in Korea seemed like the only option on the table from Riot's press before this announcement.
1	Claiming that Riot only balances based on competitive play is flat out wrong. Do you really think they are ignoring 99.9% of their customers entirely? The reason it seems like Riot balances based on competitive play, is because competitive play is the closest you can get to seeing the true power level of each individual champion.   If a champion still seems way overpowered when someone's playing them vs five of the best League players in the world, then that champion probably IS overpowered. Someone going 30-0 on Akali in Bronze 2 is obviously irrelevant when Riot think about balancing their game.   basically, Riot don't balance based on any particular skill level, they balance based on how powerful each champion each relative to the other, assuming completely equal skill levels, as well as taking into consideration the wishes and opinions of the community. professional level play is the closest you can get to truly equal skill levels, thus the balance changes seem to reflect the way the pros play the game
1	Which does kinda suck that we have to wait so long. Currently we have around 15 supports and ADC's that are considered "viable", whereas the are many, many bruisers. While there is twice as many "slots" for bruisers (Top and jungle.... and even mid, I suppose),  there isn't much of a variety for adc's and supports to pick from compared to top lane.     I personally would like to see Riot spew out a few more adcs and supports to give more options, but for adc's (A role I enjoy a lot) it is extremely difficult to design a champion based around autoattacks that doesnt "feel" like another adc only worse/better based off of stats. :( We had a good run w/ Quinn, Thresh and Nami but I'd love to see more to flesh out the smaller champion pool for these roles.
1	Despite the champion choice, which imo was amazing considering how season 3 meta evolved, the combination of Crystalline Flask + Spirit Stone will become a fotm. Probably, for the whole season. I recommend it for EVERY mana hunger champ or any champ that were dependant on Philo Stone in season 2. The cost of both items ia 1075g while Philo Stone is 700g. Also, you build it in a much easier and better way and it pays off faster than Philo Stone itself. And it's not all, Cryst Flask will make the purchase of hp pots on Nasus useless since he has a great passive that works really well clearing jungle camps. Anyway, Diamond is BY FAR the best jungler of the world considering his champion choices and playstyle. Season comes, season goes and he continues on the top.   Edit: Also, if you buils Philo Stone, I'd assume that you will basically lose 300g because it won't be smart to build anything from the initial jungle item. So Philo Stone would cost 1000g, actually.
0	Thats simply because its not SciFi in any sense. Its much closer to a pure fantasy show that just happens to go into space on occasion.   If you just call the Dr a Wizard instead, absolutely nothing changes.   The new Dr is an average action fantasy show with a terrible soundtrack. Its quite fun at times too!
1	I used to play Zac but currently, as is the nature of tank jungles, he gets to be kind of boring to use as a main, and not entirely as influential as other jungles (think rek or vi). That, though is not entirely the point. Have you read the jungle changes that have occurred in pbe and are likely in the next patch? Quick summary, they make tank jungles op as hell and give them TONS OF BONUS HEALTH. If this zac buff were to go into place, he would, after the new patch changes, quickly become just slightly, or largely perhaps, overpowered.
1	Blitzcrank by nature is a champion all about risk vs. reward. Land Rocket Grab on a priority target and you've single (robot) handedly won an entire teamfight - miss, and you're out of a sizeable cooldown and inviting your opponents to a big ol' counter-attack party. For a champion so steeped in this mindset however, Overdrive's up-time mitigated Blitzcrank's risk a little too much, leaving enemies still fleeing in fear even after a grab gone wide. Shortening the windows 'Crank has to make his big plays while increasing his burst of speed pushes this dichotomy further, but beware running out of steam if you misplay the moment.   Source:
1	Meh, her gameplay was different, she wasnt really a jungler but a top laner, mostly because her mana cost :   Her Q cost 60 mana at ALL ranks, had a higher cast range and dealt more damage  (now it is from 80 to 100). Oh and her spinderlings and herself in spider mode were more tanky
1	Actually, he's right. He shouldn't be downvoted.   It's very true what he just said. You don't have Freedom of Speech at your job do you?

1	It goes both ways, in that having a small champ pool means you only need a certain amount of rune pages, but also having a small amount of rune pages means there are certain champs you can't play efficiently to justify playing them. Having sub-optimal rune pages won't lose you a game, that's a dumb notion, but it does cause a higher chance of you losing the game, I don't think that can be argued.
0	Bullshit, I'm a woman and I imagine the banter went as follows - guy "I'm fat no one fancies me, I need to lose weight but I cant stick to it" girls reply "I tell you what lose a few pound and we will all bang you" boom welcome to incentive town. Its win win for the guy and the girls get to fulfil a fantasy with a guy the currently find cute and trust.
0	I do hate how a lot of people who claim to follow God completely forget how just He is. I am under the impression that no good man, atheist or god fearing, will be left out of heaven. If there are things they need to get done before they can go to heaven I'm sure God will give them the chance anyway. Heck millions upon millions have lived and died without ever hearing of God. I am 100% sure they will all get a chance. God isn't going to let someone sit high and dry and thrust them down to hell just because they never had the chance.
0	Don't let what your fellow Christians are doing pollute your faith!   People who claim to be Christians have been doing horribly embarrassing things since 0 BC.  Just remember that these people are being un-Christ-like.  They are Christians without the Christ.  They are Ians.   Ians are self-righteous, ignorant people who are too lazy to read their own Bible and spend all the time they should be spending on some introspection judging other people in a horribly un-Christ-like manner.  For some reason, the like to drive Hummers with Jesus fish on the back.  Would Jesus drive a Hummer?  I won't presume to say.  Perhaps Jesus, were he to need some earthly form of transportation, might choose to either drive or ride shotgun in an immaculate, shiny black Hummer with ludicrously perfect chrome bumpers.  I'm no theologian and that is really not the issue.   The issue here is whether you should be embarrassed to follow the teachings of Jesus Christ simply because of people who don't but still call themselves Christians.  If I were Jesus, which I am not, I would be embarrassed by these people and the fact that they were using my name to condone their bigotry.  However, as to your embarrassment, I would be like, "What the fudge, bro?  I died for your sins."

As I was grabbing my things a cop pulls around the corner.  He gets out of the car and tells us he was called about a different car that was parked on the same street and was reported stolen then asked us what we were doing.  I told him that I came outside to grab my bag and that we were going to walk back into my friends house.  He proceeded to yell at me every time after I repeated what we are doing saying "Kid you're starting to really piss me off, you need to cooperate and tell me what you're doing here." Or some variation of that.  He then asked us what school we go to and I told him. (It is a nice school that is known for having a lot of rich kids go there and we were in a bad part of town).  Assuming that we were rich he said "Oh so mommy and daddy are gonna come save you, huh?  What're you doing in this part of town anyway?"  I then had to inform him that we both lived not even a mile away from where we were sitting.  I had a small bag of weed in my pocket that I threw on the ground when I saw him.  When he took a walk around the car he found it and then searched the car.  (Throughout this time more cop cars are showing up.)  I had a regular brownie in my bag (I'm a fat boy) and when he found it and threw it on the hood another cop whispered to others "Of course that fat kid has a brownie in his bag." And they all giggled.  Before calling our parents he said he'd give us one more chance to cooperate and tell him the truth, I told him that I was telling the truth, when I did it pissed him Off even more and he told me that if I didn't cooperate he was legally allowed to taze and or mace me.
0	I love how some people think when they go to a game (or other certain places) that regular manners and common sense don't apply. I saw a case of total self-ownage involving just this once.   A few years back I went to a Mariners game. My brother and I had the two seats on the end of the row. Sitting right in front of us was a man and his son who was probably about 12-13 years old. During the second inning the kid starts eating sunflower seeds. He would put some in his mouth chew on them then spit the shells everywhere. He would spit several times to get rid of all the shells then repeat the whole process. After about 20 minutes of this the stairs next to him and the floor in front of him was covered in seeds and spit. He was even spitting on the handrail on almost spit on people walking past a few times. It was disgusting.   On top of it every other word out of his mouth was fuck. Personally, I don't care. I don't swear a lot, but most of the time I don't mind if others do. In this case it seemed weird and wrong coming from a kid and you could tell the other families sitting around them were getting uncomfortable.   After about 45 minutes of this kid has coated everything within about a 10 foot area in front of him with spit and seeds. Finally someone a few rows in front of them turns around and asks if he can watch his language. His dad says, "We're just having fun at the game." The guy who asked basically said, "You can have fun without screaming fuck 10 times a minute." The father says something to his son along the lines of," just be a little more quiet."   I then lean up and ask if he can spit into a cup or something. They both look at me and the dad say, "What, now he can't eats some seeds at the game?" I reply, "I don't care what he eats, but look, the stairs are covered is spit, your kid has nearly hocked one up on a few people and it is just disgusting. I feel like I'm sitting behind a snot sprinkler."   The father got pissed, got up, got an usher and asked to have us moved because we were harassing them. When the usher came everyone in the area ratted out the guy and his kid and I asked if I could be moved because I didn't want to sit in this kid's spit any longer.   In the end the father and son were removed (likely just moved to another seat, but these were good seats so anything he was moved to was not as nice) and my brother and I got moved about 10 rows up to better seats. That guy getting the usher actually led to his own downfall. Had he just told his kid to stop swearing and spit in a cup it would have been find.
0	Actually, dumbass, you asked for "evidence", not proof.  Evidence doesn't have to 100% prove something one way or the other. It just has to be something like makes it slightly more possible. For example, your lack of reading comprehension and knowledge of what words mean is  evidence  that you may be stupid, but it's not  proof  that you are stupid (because perhaps English isn't your primary language).

1	And now I had a game on 1,8k ELO!, in which a guy in lobby wanted to instalock eve + troll roaming and feeding. Somehow I told him that trolling is bannable and he stopped his idea, picked Corki (while we already had Graves) ...went top and lost it, because he couldn't play like not having vision - he was autopushing and let skarner gang him 3 times. We also had a dc karthus till 0;00 to like 10;00! So when he went back, we were loosing so hard that we couldn't stop it I guess.   In such situations/games there should be a "loose forgiven" - for the players in the lost team and elo decrease should be done only to the players who was afk or dc 2+ min... ofc the winning team should get their elo increased. Also there should be a REMAKE + PAUSE options. They are on the tournaments = competetive games, but WHY NOT ON RANKEDS??? AT LEAST ON THE TEAM rankeds...
0	Saying liberals are the reason /r/politics is shitty isn't gonna solve anything and doesn't make you any better than the idiots over there posting/upvoting bad links.  What /r/politics subscribers need to do is stop voting links up/down based on conservative/liberal.  Right now a lot of them are down voting good, insightful links because they're conservative and up voting lying, manipulative links just because they're liberal.  Stuff like the Chick-Fil-A bullshit you see on Reddit a lot today, just a giant lie.
1	900 elo scrub calling you for ksing him when you're playing graves and he's playing jungle alistar? no.   However, pro players do try to implement the strategy of KSing in competitive play. Junglers / support try and let them carries last hit the kills so the money goes to a more effective champion. I do this all the time when I play ranked 5s with my team, I would effectively hover around a champion, knowing the kill was secured, and wait until my lane can't take the kill before taking it.
0	Competitive Melee player here! Boy, you guys are missing out! Believe it or not, the Smash games are as deep as any other fighting game, though the casual learning curve is a little more relaxed, since you don't have to memorize a slew of button combos. However, it's virtually impossible for a regular player, no matter how long he/she has been playing, to keep up with a competitive player. This is because the competitive metagame has had 10 years to develop, and there are many techniques and insights that casual players will most likely not discover themselves.
1	Ranked games tests.   These games should be taken with a grain of salt.   First: Renekton Vs. Nasus:   Once I got BoRK and Brutalizer he couldn't trade with me anymore, Early game was decent and the late game felt better than the times I built Hydra and Black Cleaver by killing the enemy Caitlyn every fight, I engaged her with E > Ghostblade active and once she used her E and kited I activated my BoRK catching her every time despite Nami's help to Cait. Mid game, I was dealing a lot of damage and tanking some, too. Late game, I didn't last long in fights or deal a lot of damage. We were behind.   Second: Renekton Vs. Trunde   Trades were in my favor before buying BoRK but I couldn't kill him at all. Once I finished BoRK and Brutalizer (Both in one buy) I was able to kill him by keeping BoRK as the element of surprise.   Mid game to Late game I killed the enemy Jinx every fight and stay in fights dealing amazing damage to Ziggs/Vi/Trundle.   Late game I was able to solo a full HP Vi (Elder Lizard, Omen and Tri force) while I was at 2/5 HP (BoRK + Ghostblade + Omen).       The Ideal build in my opinion would be: Starting with what ever item, Building Bilgewater cutlass, farming 1800 Gold for BoRK to buy at once (Don't buy daggers, you're better off buying any Tier 1 or Tier 2 items to finish later) or buying Brutalizer then finishing BorK.   Buying Brutalizer > Ghostblade at once > Then going for Sunfire and Spirit Visage (Sunfire is better THIS build than Omen).   Finish with Omen or Blood Thirster.           Final Thoughts and Summary     As you can see from test's Combos, you will use your auto attacks more than you think you would.     This build in my opinion is the best for Renekton and it is what I'm going to use from now on.     Of-course you can build what ever you like, but I wish if you take these tests and calculations in considerations. My brother didn't change his build because that's his play style and what he is most comfortable with.     This took me 15 Hours and 10 bottles of water.     Please keep your feedback as constructive as you can, this was a lot of hard work and I aim to improve the next time I do something similar to this.         Summary /
1	You said you aren't a TSM fanboy so why would them winning or losing affect if you want to kill yourself? The community doesn't need a thread after every time they rage or every time they act like normal people.   If you weren't a fan boy you could just watch any other stream. Look at CLG.eu they have great discussion all the time. Curse is laid back so is EG. CLG.na has a bad rep sometime but they actually have some constuctive conversations.
0	There's a kid from high school who is really attached to me because I'm one of the only people who ever wasn't mean to her/accepted her when she came out as trans. But honestly while I wish her the best in life I have absolutely no desire to hang out with her. She keeps trying to invite herself to stay in my apartment (in another city), or to hang out while I'm visiting my parents and I always tell her I'm too busy or whatever but she keeps asking.
0	Well....they are both Democrat, you have that. BUT, as everyone else has stated the New Deal programs did nearly nothing and WW2 increased production which raised us out of the depression. To be fair, Obama has much less support and time and so it's virtually impossible for him to push through significant long-lasting legislation. In truth, they are just not comparable nor does your meme even hold a complete truth. I do relinquish though that FDR, unlike Wilson, played some part in arming America prior to our imminent involvement in the war. (Though Wilson faced massive opposition to war-involvement and was elected on a promise to stay out of war so it's not entirely comparable)
1	From my experience many of the worst players ( flame wise rather than skill wise) are older , judging from what they say and how they say it  .ie the People who think they are fantastic at the game and call out very misplay by everyone , and go on rants and rages, tend to be more verbose than the people who just grief for the hell of it. Younger players tend to be worse and when called out on it are more likely to feed or just run around doing there own thing . I think this is moreso due to embarrassment , where the older "pros" due it more out of self righteousness . Complete generalities of course , to be taken with a pinch of salt :)
1	The biggest problem is that NA scene is literally just 5 guys on a team.  There is no fear.  There is no replacement that can come in and WildTurtle anymore... not really.  Mid split, the synergy difference is too great.   In order for NA to catch up, the LCS teams will need to actually field 7 man rosters, and be serious about it.  The organizations will have to actively pursue developing talent.  Easyhoon was good when SKT picked him up, but him playing against Faker everyday (and vice versa), it catapulted him to the top of the world.  Imagine Bjergson 1v1 Froggen every day... or AlexIch... OMG... TSM would actually stand a chance!!   Ultimately, the coaches need authority, and more importantly, they need options.  Look at TL this last split!  Being able to bench Piglet is why Piglet was world class by the end of the season.  His attitude sucked.  His replacement was talented and won games!  They went back to him when he was ready, and then he performed the way they needed when it mattered most.  The time off he received, the benching persay (without actually being benched forever) was important and humbling for him..   On a brief aside, lol, the benching in NA is insane.  "We are benching XYZ player".  When do they ever come back?  Rarely... it's more like a "cut" that they don't have to pay someone (if an organization ends up cutting a player under contract, generally speaking they get a separation payoff).   In order for NA to compete, you need 7 like minded individuals who think, eat, breath, sleep the same way about the game.  Like Link said, this is a team game... Personally? I probably couldn't carry myself out of Bronze like I did in season 3.  I'm actually Bronze 3 right now mechanically.  I play 3 games a night.  But I breath this game, the theory, the jungle paths, the early game.  I shot called for a team that made it to Gold in season 3.  I did it in 3's as well.  I didn't get carried, not one game.  I actually carried more games than not, but not because I did the most damage.  It's because I was able to outrotate the other teams.  My team was able to rotate better than our competition, and that's why a team that was made up of Bronze 1 Mid laner, Plat V Top laner, Silver 2 Support, Gold V ADC, and Silver 3 Jungle were able to take games off 5 diamond teams...   It's not that impressive what we did.  It was just team mentality, the need for everyone to play perfectly [I]together[/I] instead of alone in order for us to feel like we had a shot... that is what drove us to play the game so well (comparatively speaking).
0	It's unfortunately a sad truth. American here, and some of the states public education system is down right awful. I have lived in a few states where I attended school and got a chance to see the different sides of teaching. I have seen a pristine rigid school, a downtown public school in a major city, as well as a heavy funded but poorly run system in the south.  The diversity of our education system is a great and terrible thing to have. Not all of the schools can keep up due to state laws so kids leave it not knowing basics. Our national standardized tests are easier to pass every year, due to our "No child left behind" act. Which causes the system to get even lazier and less strict. The only good form of learning we have is the secondary stage of college or a university. Where the curriculum is up to par and you're not, either study more or go home. I know this was a tangent from a person from a different nationality learning it as a second language. I just wanted to point out that America does not make it exactly easy for us either.
0	Feminism is gender specific in name.   That's because it's 100+ years old.  I modern corollary is the "Gay Rights Movement".  Gay Rights isn't about giving rights to gay people that are denied to straight people... it's about equality for people of all sexual identities.  The fact that it's name is specific to one sub-group is because that is a notable subgroup that is lacking their basic rights.  Feminism started the same way;  it's for gender equality, but was named for the group that was lacking rights.   > Feminism is gender specific in message   Well yeah, it mostly focuses on women.  Because (for the most part) men don't need that much help.   Now I need to be clear here.  I'm  not  saying that men have everything perfect.  Gender roles  definitely  hurt men as well.  But when you put things on a theoretical scale, it's clear that women are more disenfrachised and men are more empowered, on a societal level (your individual results may vary).   So the end result is that feminism focuses  more  on womans' rights, but it  also  pays attention to the general abolishment of gender roles.  While feminists will campaign strongly for little girls to play with legos, they'll also advocate for little boys to have dolls.   On your 2 topics at the end, I fundamentally disagree.   For one, I don't think equality is about "lowering" anyone.  It should be about raising us all up to the same level.  You seem to think that feminists need to do things that detriment women in order to be advocating equality, but being a detriment to  anyone  is bad.   I also think the main goals of feminism are  universally good .  It doesn't need to target a specific group in many instances, because it's just good for all of us.   Here's an example; feminism is against the idea that women are weak caregivers and men are strong breadwinners.   Now an obvious way this sees play is for gender equality in the workforce, the glass ceiling, all of that.  But let's look at another side of this:   Custody battles.   Currently, women win custody battles in 90% of cases.  You may be thinking "Yeah, gender equality should fight against that!".  Well... feminism is.   The reason women are awarded custody is because our society says that a woman's role is as a caregiver.  By erroding this societal standard, there will be a shift in the way these court decisions are decided.  For every new stay at home dad supported by his working wife, it becomes easier to award custody to a man.   By the same token, men pay far more in child support than women do.  This is because of the gender role that men are the breadwinners.   Again, feminism is very very against this.  The more women we have in the workforce, though, the easier it becomes to decide that a man should be awarded custody  and child support payments  from his ex-wife.  Something that is currently nearly unheard of.
1	DUDE! Go read the picture YOU posted. With the Support Escalation Team member. The one with the karma pic. He clearly corrected the first support member's mistake, and then clearly explained to you that LP decay has been in effect since the beginning of season 3, and therefore cannot be reverted. I think I read it just fine. Maybe you should read your own posts?

1	I get angry at people doing this, because     Most have no idea why and what they are doing there and just farm the lane then backing off ( instead bot gets pushed and they lose 4-5 waves )     it is useless with our comp because the enemy xerath/lux will just waveclear and we do nothing again.       -> The main problem is that nearly nobody has any clue where and when to push ( because if they would understand even these simple things they would be allready in plat 1 and above)
0	Well, if we're going to get technical, everything a healthy couple does in their relationship has its price. So while lonely Johns pay $200 for a companion/hr, couples usually have a nice dinner/flowers/movies what have you to spice up the chances of sexy adventures at the end of the "date".
0	People always talk about how a single voice is powerless and there isn't a point in voting, but even if it is hopeless for this round you should still vote. By the time the next election comes around, those small, growing numbers overtime show a pattern and might encourage more to fight the hopeless fight until it just might not be so hopeless anymore... or go out and crush your opponents with the sweeping majority!
0	As someone who has a large inheritance that I didn't earn, honestly I'd much rather have worked hard and struggled for things I wanted. Yeah, it's a ridiculous thing to complain about, but it really saps a lot of humanity out of your life. It also helps you realize how fucked up certain things are, like certain charities paying their executives a ton of money. And you can't even give it away or you rob someone else of what you missed out on too.

1	Rather weak early game until his Q is on a low enough cooldown and he has a revolver. Once he gets it though, probably one of the most annoying champions to go against. His Ult and E dominate teamfights. With proper usage of Sanguine Pool and Hourglass, he can dump a lot of damage while moving in and out of invulnerability. His passive is probably one of the most broken things about his kit, allowing him to build heavy AP while still becoming rather beefy. However this is rather necessary because he is somewhat of a short range caster that has to get into the thick of things to do his damage properly.   As for countering him, building MR is essential. MR affects him more so than other casters because of his design. MR reduces his damage done which in turn reduces the amount of healing he gets back. In a sense if you build MR you reduce damage he does to you while technically doing more damage to him because you limit his healing immensely. Once he gets a couple of levels, there is no trading with him really. He'll just heal off minions to heal back up. He can push the lane rather hard with his E which sets him up to be ganked. However his Sanguine Pool allows him to "NOPE" right the fuck out of any gank.   One trick is to fight him and make him burn his pool and then back off. If he tries to be aggressive after disengaging and thinks your stuff is on cooldown, your jungler has around a 20 second window where Vlad can't really do much to escape.   As for lane countering, he is one of the few mages that can actually absolutely wreck Kassadin. Vlad becomes tanky enough through his passive that he can't be bursted down. If Kassadin tries to ult-Q-E onto Vlad, Vlad can pool quickly before the Q connects and negate the combo. The only downside is that it costs him 20% of his current health to pool. His pool lets him wreck most skillshot reliant champions in lane too. He is a very strong top and mid champion. The only problem with mid is that he must play very careful in early game because he risks being bursted down before he has any items to make him tanky.   As mentioned earlier, MR hurts him hard. Top laners like Irelia and Udyr can wreck him pretty hard once they get a wits end. After that, they basically shrug off most of Vlad's damage. His other counter is dot (damage over time) damage because his pool doesn't remove debuffs. Because of this, Fiddlesticks and Swain can murder Vlad simply because they sustain as well as him and Vlad can't really avoid their damage.
1	This is the defining characteristic of Moba vs MMO games though. If you want to truly have no idea go play World of Warcraft, there's 11 classes. 11 options. That's as large of a pool as can be created where in a free for all melee things are level and there is no tier system it's just fire beats water, water beats leaf, leaf beats fire kind of shit.   If your dislike pokemon gameplay and WoW, then play League of Legends where shit's crazy as fuck, there is tiering, there is OP shit, there is underpowered shit, there is amazing plays, there is sweat under your arms after 40 minutes of turrent siege. If it's too much for you to handle, then go play the game where 0.2s actually doesn't matter because you can just polymorph someone for 8s, then silence them for another 4s, then cyclone them for another 8s, then root them for 3s, then re-polymorph them for 4s and so on and so forth.
0	Knowing tow truck drivers well, this is very likely to be true (OP's story). Even if it weren't, tow truck drivers like to fuck with people. There's a level of sadism that comes with the job, specifically in colder climates.   They dislike their job, the long hours (for overnight companies) are rough, they deal with pissed off/shitty individuals multiple times a day in person, and - most of all - anyone who gets paid big money to grab cars illegally parked during snow removals has to be a bit twisted. Morals are somewhat thrown out the window with tow companies; everyone acts like their a victim of a crime and no one is to blame but the driver of the vehicle because they are the ones to have parked incorrectly.
0	He's talking about the fat people hate. I mean, it happens with negative impression stories in general, but you see a ton of rage stories because SOMEWHERE there's someone who's fat/black/jewish/rich/poor/male/female who's being a gigantic asshole, actually there's a lot of them, and some of them are probably being an asshole in some special way that relates to the thing about them that later is mentioned on reddit.   Thing is, in your daily life you probably only meet one or two of these types of asshole, and only rarely, so you see it never in person, but all the time on reddit, because there are just a fuck ton of people on reddit ready and waiting to share there stories of some shit that they found or that happened to them, usually that was really annoying because when something pisses you off and you can't react to it in person, you want to vent.
1	I think you guys are being a little hard on the Giants organization. They are a small org that probably couldn't afford a gaming house unless the team made LCS. Don't forget a gaming house requires a credit check which you will fail if you don't have income or at least can show that you have investors that will cover the cost if your income falls through. Financing PC's? credit check. Financing furniture? credit check. If you are a small organization these can take a lot of time. All it takes is a look at their sponsors page to see that they might struggle to make ends meet or at least provide proof that they could afford to rent/buy a house without the LCS salary.   The next step after actually being able to purchase/rent a house (after finding one that suits your needs of course which can take over a week) is when you can actually close on the house/move in. Only big organizations can actually afford to do these things ahead of time and even then it is a risk. Considering I would guess that Giants! was probably paying their players with borrowed money to begin with you can't fault them too much.
1	just bought and haven't played are two very different things. I just bought  vladimir, but I played him many, many times on his free weeks. The first game after I bought him I went 20 and 3 and nearly got a penta (had the quad and graves ult sniped it)
0	I wish this was how I was raised. I remember begging my mom to give me chores/jobs so I could make my own money. She would always just reply with, "What do you need money for when I can just give you everything you need?" It astounds me that this was her stance for so long because she's worked in banking for 20+ years, so you would think that somebody with her experience would encourage her child to learn the value of a dollar.   This dynamic continued into high school when having my own money would have actually been beneficial for me. She told me I could get a job, but she didn't want me to drive until I was 18. I  would  say that she didn't "allow" me to drive or work, but that's not passive-aggressive enough for her. She simply made piles of excuses to not help me hand in job applications or bring me to the DMV.   From her point of view, I knew she thought she was keeping me from doing drugs/drinking/smoking cigarettes for as long as possible. Little did she know, I would steal money from her purse and do just that anyways. I hate that I stole from her, but I also hate that she stunted me socially and financially. I was largely sheltered in many ways and I am paying for that now. I envy people my age who are confident that they can take care of themselves. I'm still under my smother's thumb at 22 and while it's nice to have a safety net, I know that I would be so much more responsible and motivated if i had learned these lessons when there wasn't any risk from failing.
1	Tell us your thought process either after the game or after a big play. It's one thing to watch, but to know what you're doing and why would really help out everyone.
1	Lol, judging by the responses here I think it really explains why a lot of people are stuck in Silver or low Gold or whatever. You are playing against a Platinum+/better player. They will expose your mistakes. They will beat you. Fucking learn from it! You should be grateful every time you get to lane against a smurf or someone with relatively low MMR in normals - you have a golden opportunity to learn what happens when you play that matchup correctly or incorrectly. You learn what your lower level opponents could be doing, and when they do it wrong/don't do it, you can expose their mistakes in turn. Don't QQ in a corner about how you got beat up in a matchup you ought to have won - think about WHY you lost, and the answer is never, ever 'they're just better than me'. Think about the factors that went into it.
0	You can have a "crossfit" training program that gets you pretty damn strong with the endurance aspect as well.  You can have a "traditional weight training" program that gives you close to the same results.  Alternatively, you can have a "crossfit" and "traditional" program that gives absolutely shitty results.  It all comes down to who is doing the programming and if they understand a thing or two about energy systems and such.  I personally center my training around getting stronger all the time, in which you can't really go wrong.  I throw crossfit into that as it is a fun way to get cardio/muscular endurance training in (just don't go overboard, maybe 2-3 metcons per week) and I love the competitive aspect.
1	It's not about the champion, it's about the player. Everything in this game is about the person playing. Sure, it's a given that some champs have skills that do well versus others, but it lies with personal ability to cope well with that.
1	Veigar is a champion working essentially around his ultimate, once his ultimate is down, assuming he killed an enemy with it the teamfight starts beeing essentially a 4v4, as his W and E also have a very big cooldown, and his Q damage is not that high, its his lowest hitting spell.   On the otherhard, Syndra reloves around distruption with her R>E combo, seriously just get 3 orbs down, ult and E. If you are level 18 everyone close to you is stunned, because there where 8 orbs flying around stunning people. Also her damage is much more going on around her Q and W which are on a low cooldown.
0	Something similar happened to me in both 5th and 3rd grade. They were both extremely bias against the boys. The 5th grade teacher harassed us, the 3rd grade teacher humiliated and disciplined us.   Our 3rd grade teacher had favorites, of which I was one at the beginning of the year, but somehow that changed. Soon I was the bad kid who was blamed as the ringleader for the 3rd grade boys. It got to the point where she would make me change clothes for gym in the same room as her while she watched, which was really traumatic for me because I have bad social anxiety. She said I would cause too much trouble if i was left to change with the other boys, and would give me detention if I refused to change out of my uniform for gym. She's dead now, of old woman syndrome.   My 5th grade teacher was just generally biased against boys. She once lined us all up and made us tell the class if we were circumcised or not. She wouldn't let us leave the room until all boys answered. This was a catholic school, so those who were not circumcised were seen as outliers, and the whole school quickly knew. I was sad knowing that one of my close friends was now being made fun of because he had to tell a bunch of 5th grade girls that his penis looked different. This same teacher also told me I would go to hell because I went to church with my episcopalian father. When I told my dad all of this, he came into school and shamed our teacher into tears. Literal, glorious tears.   I'm now a 23 year old agnostic who hates authority. Thanks school! I grew up fast.
0	I can't believe how many people follow them. They cherry pick/use corrupted scientific studies to support there theory that being overweight is as healthy/healthier than average healthy weight.   For example the one dude/dudette who did a study of the lifespan of fat people against healthy weight people. Yes, he/she did do it and said fatter people live longer, but his/her study was disproved as most of the healthy weight people where smokers  alcoholics, etc. Whereas the heavier set people didn't do those things. TiTP used and tried (not sure if they still are using it, wouldn't surprise me) to use/support this study after its corruption was proven.   Then they go on to complain about being discriminated for being fat or when they are called whales, and say things such as "those dumb skinny bitches, they are all whores".   Also, they have the nerve to compare "fat discrimination" to homosexual discrimination and racism. The majority of the time, being fat is a choice, whereas being gay or black (unless your Michael Jackson) is not a choice.   Thin Privilege: I'm so tired of having to deal with my fat consequences, I'll just blame it all on people who have thin benefits!
0	Just before he told me this he was telling me about how he had to search someone's property for a call he was on.  He said there was a dog keeping him from checking the back yard.  His supervisor told him to shoot the dog if needed and that he had his back.  Good Lord my Thanksgiving is going to be eventful because we'll be having a discussion about these two things.
1	Op wanted my kit. If it looks weird because of all the edits, its just a copypasterino.   > In all honesty this would be an amazing champion. The lore they could put behind her being brought out of thresh's lantern, or even fighting her way out, would be so incredible. And if we got to keep this champ as is in this drawing, rito would have my money in an instant.   Edit: A letter   Edit 2: I Promised a kit, so here goes.   Edit 3: More words   I've created her as a mage with some mobility. I tried to take aspects from both Thresh and Lucian and put them in to Senna's kit, and as is obvious, none of this is set in stone. Please for all that is awesome, help me balance her! Feedback is most welcome!   for reference throughout this long post:   Bold will be for skill names      This text will explain the skill    (Parentheses will be for explaining why I have the skill in the kit, and what it does.)   Passive- Spellslinger       After every spell Senna casts, she may cast a no-cost Ardent Blast that does 1/4    the damage of a normal Ardent blast. This has a separate cool down from her regular     Ardent Blast.    (I tried to make this like Lucians passive, but more fun and engaged with her kit. It does a small amount of damage because i don't want it being too overpowered)   Q- Ardent Blast      Senna throws forth a spectral blast, damaging enemies in a circle, dealing    more damage near the center of the ability.    (Every mage needs their primary damage spell, and this one is Senna's. Its low mana cost, low cool down, but also low damage, think Ezreal q, but it deals 50% damage at the edge of the circle and 100% damage near the center. I'm thinking 700 range, with no cast time. This skill is also vital for her passive and ult.)   W-Wax/Wane      In a line in front of Senna, she ebbs the flow of space, and sends a wave     of energy to and from a target point in a straight line. If this ability connects    with a champion, it will push them away 100 units. If this ability connects     with one of the end rods of Senna's "Soul Tether' wall, then it moves the     wall 100 units towards her.    (This is one of Senna's most crucial skills when paired with her E, it is supposed to be somewhat like flay. It was originally going to move  only champions instead of the wall, but I think it is a little less overpowered. 600ish range?)   E-Soul Tether     Passive- If an enemy champion is damaged by "Soul Tether", they gain a    stack of soul tethers passive. At one stack the champion is slowed by    30%. At four stacks they are stunned for 2 seconds    Active- Senna summons two spikes from the ground (think thresh box    wall corners) tethered together by an ethereal chain (think Karthus wall,   except only 4 Teemos wide and very thin). if an enemy champion steps   through this chain they take a small amount of damage. If a champion    moves 50 units through the tether while it is still active, they take the    same damage again. Senna may re cast this ability on either of the spikes    to jump to that spike 100 units away in a line with the tether.    (So. This is the most important skill on Senna. It is her mobility and her stun, which is weird, cause you can't use it to get away and stun at the same time. the combo with this and her w is as follows, Land the tether on a champion (proc 1, slows), jump to a spike and cast your w on the tether to move the wall back and your opponent forth, forcing them to move through it (procs 2 3 & 4, stuns enemy). Keep in mind every spell she casts gives her a free q as well, so weave those in there somewhere.)   R-Walk in to the Light     Senna Summons an ethereal pistol, and fires a barrage of 10 (maybe 15)    Ardent Blasts at an opponent over 3 seconds. while her ultimate is active,    these 10 ardent blasts will home in on the enemy it was first cast on. If    Senna Does not wish to target an enemy with the blasts, she may hold    down R instead, and they will be aimed at her cursor. Senna may move    freely during "Walk in to the Light".    (Kind of like a Syndra ultimate but with more freedom, I think this will be a high damaging skill, but right now i don't want to make her too overpowered, best to start small and work up, right? )
0	This is no joke! So, in December I was walking down a mere 6 steps leading to a line of stone steps that crossed the yard to the house. BUT WAIT! I was drunk. BUT WAIT! It was storming and flooding. Seems dangerous? Rewind two weeks prior; clear, beautiful night and I'm drunk... I take 5 steps, BAM! Ground. Sprained ankle.   Now, back to the "present:" lighting and thunder and HOLDING my phone as a flashlight and 'A Storm of Swords' MISS the last step again :( and now permant injury to my ankle :( I've been training for a 5k recently and I kinda feel as though its been helping my ankle and back problems!
1	Let me use my last game as an example.   I'm playing Udyr, cleared my buffs, head over bot to see enemy Malphite coming to gank. So I countergank, and we kill him, Draven, and Soraka. I'm pretty happy about bot, so I help mid and he gets kills off Zed twice.   Meanwhile on top lane, our "AP Nid" is playing vs a teemo who she does kill once, but teemo continues to be annoying and farms up.   20 mins in, we get a couple dragons, score is about 24/10 overall. Suddenly, nidalee complains about it being a badgame 'bg' she says.   We ignore that comment, and continue to push lanes. Nid gets caught out and dies, immediately starts surrender vote. We all decline. She keeps saying "we're gonna lose" for no apparent reason. I mute her and continue playing. At this point, trist also has a bad score, even from her being 3 kills ahead in lane. I have no clue how.   So 10 mins of defending, nid and teemo getting caught out, the kill difference is 25/38.   Eventually , we lost two inhibs, and lost the game.   My point, however, is that what do I do when someone decides to 'down syndrome' the team and we lose a winnable game.
1	The analogy is there for the purpose of understanding the core concept, which I believe is properly illustrated. The community is complaining of compensation, not the lack of server stability, and I proposed an analogy as to how the game servers crashing affected some people more than others, and how some people were compensated due to coming out a lot more scathed than the rest of the crowd. Regardless of, we all chose to wait for those 5 hour long log in times. And some poor bastards not only waited, they found out when they got there that all their content was erased.
1	If a champion is way stronger than most champions overall when played at her max capacity she is OP whether the player is good with her or not.   Saying that a champion is not OP just because 90% players can't play that champ and utilizing every strength is just stupid. The champion is still unbalanced in tournaments because all the pro players are within the 10% of the people that play that champ to its full potential.
1	I responded below but in ANY competitive sport, you do this both as a winner and loser no matter what for several reason. One is to show that those who did stay and play (instead of quitting) tried their best. Would you rather they call you noobs and tell you to uninstall? Two, both winners and losers shouldn't let one battle/game get to them and to keep their cool. How would it look like for those in the LCS to storm off after losing badly?
1	I wonder if riot is releasing this map as a template to start themed events again.  It seems like a very basic version of our current map.  Then they can easily add new features over it to give us event maps.   So for example the whole void invasion.  Maybe for the next month it will be somewhat destroyed looking from the void infestation happening.   Another cool idea is we will get for another month the Arctic invasion stuff we voted for.   I for one miss the halloween and winter themed maps.
1	Since 3.14, every game I've played support in, I find that I'm having to hold back a LOT to ensure that the ADC is actually getting the kills. I'm barely trying to poke the enemy team back, and I'm nearly killing them every time.   This could have something to do with the tier I'm playing in having no idea what we're doing... but at the same time, it didn't play out this way before the patch.
1	Trolling when you don't get your pick is stupid.   Being a douche about having an earlier pick and making a big show about taking what someone else called or asked for is asking for trolls and butthurts.  The army that marches with butthurts loses every time.
1	I apologize for saying this, but just by looking at your build for him, you have no idea what you're doing.   Bork? Trinity? You're mixing burst with sustained damage there for the first part, and no armor pen, which is something new Rengar desperately needs even more than old Rengar. Not to mention you have no damage due to going bork on him. Nice for kiting and catching up to someone with the active, but that's about it, you're better off just going ghostblade if you're looking for catch actives, plus it gives you the AS you keep implying is important as well as armor pen.   I will agree that his W is overall better due to how much it heals around and the fact you get around 40 defensive stats if you hit two people mid-lategame now, but his E is incredibly difficult to lane if you aren't on top of someone or right behind someone chasing them, which really changes nothing from when it was used before they reworked it, even though I will say that I love seeing the animation fly out now from time to time.   And no, his Necklace has not been buffed in every way, I will admit it is nice not losing all your stacks because someone got away with a sliver of health, but still, I would still much prefer 10 armor pen and CDR at three stacks than mobi boots with less speed, or the fact that at max stacks you basically half your ult un-nerfed, not buffed as far as I'm concerned. Oh, and I almost forgot, you don't get an actual lategame trinket unless you sell it and buy a real trinket.   And seriously, his ult has been buffed? While the cd has been reduced, I think...(I've been using cdr runes since the rework, I don't know if it's from my side or the rework side), but you had nearly every other part of it nerfed since you can't run away with it anymore unless your opponents are braindead and can't figure out you're going to the nearest bush to jump on one of their asses.
1	You are forgetting Reinforced Armor (reduces total critical strike damage by 10%). It is by far the most hard counter option as it eliminates just a little less than 10% of Ashe's damage in a game from beginning to end for the cost of one mastery point. Compare this to what was previously considered the strongest defensive mastery in the game (Juggernaut's 3% HP) and it becomes obscene. If you think that more than a third of damage inflicted on you will come from the enemy Ashe ADC (perfectly reasonable) then it becomes the best mastery in the game. It is effectively a free ninja tabby passive for free. Any champion that can think of going into the defensive tree it going to do ridiculously well vs Ashe if they pick up the mastery. It is not Master Yi but Olaf (Jungle or Top) that is going to be the biggest hard counter in the game considering that he can both avoid the slow, ult and rationally go into the defensive tree to pick up the mastery. This is a hard counter that is only beat by the Twisted Fate vs. Kassadin lane match up.
1	The only reason I'm still playing is because I don't want to be bad at a different MOBA again. Having to relearn the champs, items, abilities, objectives, etc.  Just takes time. I agree with a lot of what you said, but I can let most of that slide without getting too annoyed. The one thing I can't though, is the fact that they have these featured game modes. The game modes themselves are okay for a bit, and then its boring.   But.   U.R.F. was never, not once in the two straight weeks I played it, boring. It never got old or made me angry. I would laugh when I was losing. I would laugh when someone was feeding. You get what I'm saying. I understand it was a limited time game mode and they had more ideas they wanted to bring out. That's nice. If I game mode was popular like URF, why not keep it in the game? The amount of people I've heard say, "If URF was still around I would play league", is really high.

1	You're the stupid one if you can't even understand what he said. His friend is playing bad (aka toxic play) so that in the end everyone reports his teammates because they flamed through chat while he said nothing but enraged others with his lack of team play and unwillingness to win.
1	Gladly.   Firstly, let me start off by saying that Riot is not a very nice company. They kick other games out of venues with their own. Now that doesn't sound so bad (kicking out their competetion), but it's still pretty scumbaggy. That isn't really the issue however.   The issue is that a certain Riot employee, who I'm sure many people are aware of, named Pendragon. This man fucked the DotA community for several YEARS IIRC, by taking away their website named DotA-Allstars.com. And let me just link you this little nice comment:   He stole ideas from other people on the forums, and used it to make champions in League of Legends without giving credit to other people. It's entirely scumbag and really fucked up, and even Tryndamere tried to defend him on Reddit as well, saying that Pendragon was the 'dark horse' of the entire shenanigans.   It's really sad how Riot hires some of these people that have fucked entire communities on their own, and then defend them for those actions.
1	I'm Korean, but not a EUW Korean.   I'm not sure about the gaming ban for under 21 (I don't know much about it, sorry). If it's like what the sentence is suggesting (online gaming is banned), that isn't good at all. Any type of ban like that is not right. If a game has age restriction, then yes they can try to make sure kids aren't playing Mature games. However, if it's something like LoL, there shouldn't be an online gaming ban on it if you happened to be a teenager.   Gaming can be considered an addiction. You hear stories of people dying in PC rooms because they don't leave their computers to take care of basic needs. Those people are addicted to gaming. What I'm worried about is that S. Korea is taking only the negatives of gaming into consideration. If there's someone that is completely addicted to ANY type of hobby, there should be at least an institution to help them get rid of that addiction. When I hear of parents GAMING instead of taking care of their children to the point where the government has to take away the children, I'm very sad that nothing is done about the parents. If the government has to do anything at all, there should be a campaign where they try to educate PARENTS to teach their children that having hobbies are good as long as hobbies don't rule their lives (i.e. Don't put too much time into hobbies if you have something more important to do).   Online gaming is positive since it's bringing something "new" to the global economy. It also allows people not in the gaming community to see that gaming isn't that much different from any other media. Although I agree that it isn't a "sport," I do agree with the term E-Sports.
0	Right, and in a perfect world, those employees would always get that money. In the real world, a server who claims less than minimum wage is going to get accused of underclaiming tips and be fired (or threatened with it), particularly in a right-to-work state.   I have literally never heard of a server actually receiving money from their employer to make up the difference to minimum wage.   Obviously, speaking only from my experience.
1	I thoroughly disagree with the first half of your comment and its unfortunate its currently at the top. It grossly oversimplifies what most of the article is about and downplays the bigger issues that are discussed.   On to the article, the lawyer does refer to various sections of the contract being standard/common several times throughout the article and those sections, very clearly, have the shortest commentary. It could be summarized as "The author of the article notes the skewed nature of the contract toward Riot while also mentioning its fairly standard." There is literally next to no commentary outside of that except examples given in some sections like the limited liability. However, much of the article concerns very relevant matters to players/organizations alike such as:     name/likeness    promotional restrictions   lack of appeals process   forfeiting right to class action lawsuit       For those looking for a nice

Third Hit: Exaggerated sweeping slash from left to right. BLADE STOPS GLOWING.   3 hits with a specific, unwavering animation pattern AND an additional particle that indicates when her passive will proc and fades when her passive times out. She already has 2 buff indicators, she doesn't need a third.

0	Maybe they trusted in the basic decency of people and assumed the place was completely safe for their daughter? In Paris or Dublin, for example, its not uncommon at all for people to bring their kids to the bar. People there act like decent adults with a healthy and mature attitude about drinking. It's a perfectly safe place for kids to be.
1	If anyone remembers, Regi's other brother Jonas stepping in and helping them out was what led them into their glorious four LAN victories in a row. They really need someone like him to come into the house and discipline them. CLG has Kelby, Curse has Liquid, and they're doing better I think. TSM needs to get their shit together and I think a good manager would do it. Regi  does way too much right now: he's their manager, he runs the solomid.net website, and he's the AP mid player. That's way too much responsibility, he needs to focus on his playing more.
0	Well that's a contentious point in the UK at the moment, actually. Our government is forcing a lot of highly disabled people into work, even when physically unable. They are also taxing them higher for having empty bedrooms in their houses, and limiting their disability by a large amount. Coupled with a tax cut for the millionaires and billionaires of 5%,  our situation is bad. So, even though official figures disregard people on disability in terms of unemployment, the numbers only going to rise with more people being deemed fit for work.
1	Thats definitely the kind of thing I want to see from high-level players. They all have the mechanics, they all have the knowledge, so you have to get tricky, not just change things to make it easier. Like when Dyrus failed his flash, but the guy chasing didn't, because it's diamond and you don't just mess up a flash like that. Except he did, and now Dyrus is safe, and the offending enemy (Wukong as it happens) is on the other side of a wall.
1	Skillshots usually have a slightly larger hitbox than what is suggested by the indicators or animations (just look at Morgana or Blitz) to make them "feel more repsonsible" for the player firing it. Also, skillshots usually hit edge-to-edge, which makes you receive the effect even if you barely touch the hitbox. (compared to e.g. Ryze Q, where you have to be close enough to hit the enemy center. This also increases ranges of skillshots slightly if you get Lulu ulted or makes it harder to hit a (literally) fed Cho with a targeted ability)
1	I'd suggest finding a champion you love, and maining them for a while.  Meaning playing only that champ for a good amout of time.  When you learn one champ really well a lot of confusion and barriers are lifted.  You see how the game works with this champ and you can slowly take that experience into other champions if you wish.  I think of it like math.  If you jump from one concept before fully understanding a key point that comes before the new concept, you'll always struggle at least a bit.  Imagine if when you were younger they decided to start teaching you multiplication before you even fully understood addition.  It'd be a real struggle.   Find a good guide on your champ, read it thoroughly, and you'll improve because you'll be able to focus easier.  You'll be thinking about how to play that specific champ and have a base for improvement.  Jumping around champs can make things difficult.  On top of learning the idea of not overextending you're trying to learn a new champion.  Eventually when you get the hang of it, things should go a little like: Hey on Teemo I learned how to not overextend, now let me bring that to a new champ.  Then you learn something different on another champ like last hitting more efficiently.  And over time you build up these ideas until they come naturally and you can apply them to any champion you play.
0	They're not playing with a little girls life, they're telling her what it will cost  themselves  to save her life, and what they will need to be reimbursed. Their first estimate was wrong. People make mistakes. Now they realize that they will need more money for the additional  post-operative  treatments over the next few years, not the initial surgery which is covered. And why do you think a car salesman would sell you a car at a 25% discount after a price raise? Because you pinky promised? Things have hard prices. Hospitals need money to function. Because healthcare is privatized rather than socialized in the US, this money must come from the patient, whether they're a wall street banker or a 5 year old girl in croatia. CHOP is the norm for hospitals.
0	Because psychology.   People with these crazy coler dyed hair, are usually doing it (whether subconsciously or consciously) because they feel they are not getting the attention they desire - usually from the opposite sex- so the little voice in their head says "we should dye our hair something wacky... like fluorescent green...then people will notice us" -yes their inner voice sounds like gollum.   Its generally the same reason you see people who dress goth/punk or in something utterly ridiculous, for no other reason, than to get attention from people who otherwise wouldnt even see them in a crowd.
0	I always live by the saying, "beauty is in the eye of the beholder." While you may be right about Gina not being as pretty as Stacy, I think one (I do, personally) could find Gina to be much more beautiful simply because of the fact that she has a much better personality.   I wouldn't go so far as to say my gf is the most beautiful person on the face of this planet, but I usually find her to be prettier than most the girls I know, simply because she doesn't have a scumbag personality. (Where a ton of the girls I know do have that personality type.)   I'll also admit most of them are probably good in bed, but I don't think I could ever like it.
1	Yes, he has incredible awareness and understanding of the game, he manages to stay positive despite his personality no matter how the game is going and he is very good at coordinating his own team (granted, this probably only works this well with him because he's "famous"), he usually stays relevant in the game even when he loses lane and manages to attract jungle pressure, he's not a perfect player, he makes mistakes and doesn't always win lane but despite his attitude he's usually very humble about his mistakes.
0	Well apparently my girlfriends likes to make out sometimes without going all the way. It always results in me becoming horny, and trying to take it to the next level, and sometimes she then would say she is not in the mood. However since I have told her that, I know when she does it, she actually wants me to fuck her brains out.
1	What I described was a generic situation where something similar will occur probably one out of 5 games at least, one out of 3 on a bad day (and not every lane has to be feeding for that to happen either, it can easily happen even if a lane won, and sometimes even if 2 lanes won).  What you described was a random thing that happened to you one time.  I'm not going to argue with you when you can't even follow a conversation.
0	lol, that's hilarious.   i remember when i was a kid, there were these things called "sitcoms". sometimes they had a "jukebox".
1	To be honest i dont think League evolved in a good way, considering toxicity is still as high as before (if you wanna flame, you will, 3 messages are enough), also the chat restriction is like stoping a fight in a bar and continue to give everybody a pistol so it gets really bloody(seriously, trolls have more power now since reports are actually not useless now).   Im also pretty sure Riot is lying like "95% of players didnt received punishment bla bla it only hits toxic people", just for fun i asked people in champ-select (high gold/low plat) and 3/5 had chat restriction. Im not sure if they just give us "good looking" numbers (you know, ignoring facts that from 95% of players 20-30% are smurfs maybe and anything else that makes them good looking).   And the patches...its seems kinda random, i mean leBlanc can still oneshot people without counterplay(inb4 "buy banshees hue hue") while khazix gets now nerfed into oblivion. If community wants a LeBlanc-Nerf Riot runs around:"oh my god, noobs LeBlanc is fine l2p, we are anyway smarter and superior", while they back off for some random reasons when they wanted to do lee changes(this would be the best thing for him imo, i dont remember numbers but taking his godmode with lvl 4-11 and give him a lategame where he's no useless kicking machine seems like a good idea).   And at this point we're not even talking about "forgiven loss" and servers which seems is controlled by a magical chicken that steps randomly on buttons.   And guys, im NOT Xpecial but I really think people are now passive aggressive,this one or two sentences at the end of a lost game like:"next time dont pick jungler if u cant play it" or "thx for the gangplank-pick"(<- Thats okay imo, picking gp should be official considered trolling)
1	Rageblade rush 1st item almost everytime because i like the ridiculous 1v1 dueling it provides, this is what i mean by bring other items that compliment the items already, think about how runaan is much more powerful if you have a BotRK because of the way the spray dmage works, it may not be an optimal build, but there will always be a defined meta of items anyway. People will always strive to find the optimal stats and once those are found the meta builds for that champion are born, the items themselves are not actually horrible its just that people actually KNOW which ones are better, its impossible to perfectly balance all the items, the best thing to do would be to create too much imbalance by having too many item build possibilities to create a solid meta.
1	Unconventional picks will never see the light of day.   I play Nidalee jungle often (and fairly well at Plat level), but I would say at LEAST 70% of my lobbies are dodged when I pick her. On top of that, if I stay in the queue my teammates will instantly ban the champion I want (Nidalee) because they don't support my pick. If I really want to play jungle Nidalee I will sometimes have to sit through 5 or 6 lobbies until I find a game (20+ minutes). If dodges had no penalty I guarantee that number would skyrocket even higher. I know everyone swears by the meta in ranked, but a lot of people like to try new things like Soraka mid or Lulu top or Twitch jungle or AP J4. With more/free dodges these players suffer.
0	I think it's because rather than pay more tax at the end of the year we charge sales tax instead. So, businesses transfer the tax onto the consumer and with tax rates wildly fluctuating: from city to city, county to county, state to state there are different rates.
0	Story time. It's hot, in the middle of summer, in MN. Brother and I decide to head on over to DQ, 'cuz soft serve is amazing. When we get there's like 20 people waiting to place an order or waiting on food. I order a cookie dough shake while my brother gets an oreo blizzard.Some poor 17yo girl, stressed with all the people waiting for them calls our order and instinctively flips both items upside down. Bro's blizzard defies gravity while my shake explodes across the counter. The poor girl's face was a face of someone ready to collapse or run away.

0	Alright, story time. For context, I'm a homosexual. Not bi or anything, no sexual interest in women. I've been suffering from depression for YEARS, and lately it's hit me how lonely I am. Well, last year, I was lab partners in school with this super nice girl. We had chemistry, and regardless of how close we became, we could have a pretty fantastic discussion on any conversation, and we got pretty deep sometimes. Well, senior year started, and we happened to walk in at the same time on the first day. She started talking to me, and the chemistry is still there. Suddenly she's the only thing I can think about, how I might have a shot at not being alone because of her, and how my life can be perfect. Today, we passed each other in the hall, and she made eye contact and smiled.
1	A major mistake many people make is that they stick strictly to their build and don't change it situationally. Lets say you are playing Sivir against a team that has no magic damage but your build has magic resist in it. Change the build for that one game and get armor and not magic resist.   This^   I've seen so many games where people moan and gripe about how "OP" someone is and they refuse to deviate from their build by getting some sort of defensive items.   It drives me nuts seeing people get stomped but refusing to try to counter the enemy team.   Item builds can have some consistency, but they are not set in stone.   Personally, I use the builds in guides as a starting point until I figure out what fits my play style. I also ask my friends what's worked for them and why.   For example(please don't flame, only done normals so far, but I found I did well with this build), Taric, I decided to just play him as a super tanky support(mostly defensive items, with very little focus on mana or AP). And I did pretty good with it, lots of assists, tanked and team fights with easy, etc. I later went to go look for a highly rated guide on using taric as a tank and couldn't seem to find one that improved upon or was really relevant to my taric playstyle.   That was a bit off-topic and people will probably make snide remarks about it, but if I had just strictly followed taric builds/guides I would not have found this playstyle that I have a lot of fun with. It's awesome watching people blindly focusing on to me and watching my team rip them apart.
0	This will probably get downvoted to oblivion or buried, but there's something that a lot of you people don't understand about rape.  And that bothers me.   Consent is not a one-time thing.  It must be continual, which it is unless someone puts a stop to it or becomes unresponsive.  If someone says yes to having sex with you, then yeah, sex is fine, but each person has the right to call off said sex as soon they want to.  I don't know how long it took this guy to pull out, but if she was crying and freaking out, that's probably too long.  Legally, that is unambiguously rape.  It doesn't matter that she had consented initially.  She wanted to end it, and she was allowed to do that.  I know that might sound like bullshit, but there's a pretty good reason for that.   Usually, when we think about rape it's some guy jumping out of the bushes to attack a woman with a knife.  That kind of rape is actually pretty rare.  Most rapes are perpetrated by someone who knows the victim, often in situations like this.  This might seem like a "minor" rape, but "minor" rape does not exist.  All rape can have a very powerful effect on the victim.  Sex is an act of intimacy and bonding.  It's opening up oneself to someone else.  A forced perversion of that can really mess with someone's head.  It's one thing to threaten someone's safety to force them to open up, and while it might be a tad different to just force yourself upon someone, the underlying damage that the perpetrator does is still the same.  The guy might have been sorry.  Hopefully, this played into his sentencing, but he still committed the crime of forcing this woman's intimacy when she didn't want it.   Now, some people might be calling bullshit.  I don't really know any more than what has been presented to me in this thread.  I don't really care.  If a court of law of law convicted him, and the OP's description of events is accurate, then I'm happy for her and hope that she can put back the pieces of her life.  If she lied and this guy got convicted, then yeah, fuck her, but I would like to point out that false accusations of rape are believed to be pretty rare, especially compared to actual rape.  False accusations are terrible and can ruin a person's life, but equating the risk of this happening with the risk of getting raped for real are not even close.  And finally, if the whole thing is bullshit, whatever.  This is reddit, and if someone gets imaginary internet points for a lie, I can't really say that I give a shit.   I mostly came here to point out that rape not only can happen to anyone, but it can be perpetrated by almost anyone as well.  Know your rights, and those of the person you plan on having sex with.  It's not terribly complicated.  If you aren't sure about something, just ask them.
0	If OP wanted to get his attention he could of used his horn or hazard lights or changed lanes and tried to signal him.   How is putting his car is a position where it might get hit trying to get attention, and not simply  trying to cause a collision   So basically, if I want to get the attention of another driver I use my horn, hands, or light. I don't try to hit them with my car or make them hit my car. I don't even open up that  possibility , like OP did.
1	The only thing i can say : tsm played really really bad, coast used those mistakes and won the game. 3 major mistakes were done: early invade, 2 baron attempts.
0	My grandpa has a gas tank on his farm to fill up trucks and farm equipment, and about a year ago he found out someone was stealing gas from him at night. Instead of staying up all night to catch him, he put a different kind of fuel in the tank one night, and the following morning he found the guy a mile down the road with a huge truck that wasn't working. I'm not sure what happened after that, but I know the guy had two black eyes the next morning. He stopped stealing gas from that day forth...
0	I am super lucky in the smell department - it's pretty much nonexistent until after a few days when I've been told on multiple occasions I smell quite nice. Your ex is super wrong about the deodorant. I've never had to wear it and only started to a year ago since out helps with razor burn. I still don't put it on every day and there's been no change in my odor (or lack thereof). Maybe if you get the medical grade stuff it might be different, but I think the smell he's thinking of has more to do with age and the changing of people's body than a dependency.
0	Neuroscience PhD student here.   Hormones act in 2 ways. There are organizational effects and activational effects. An organizational effect is something that occurs extremely early in development during a critical period, and cannot be changed later in life (your brain is organized a certain way). Activational effects are not related to development, but they are events in which your hormone receptor is activated, serves its purpose, and then "shuts off".   During the first 8 weeks of embryo development, the presence or absence of the Y chromosome (more specifically, the SRY gene) determines if tests or ovaries begin to develop. Once these organs have begun to develop, they will start to produce hormones, either Estrogen (female) or Testosterone (male), and these will effect how your brain and neural circuitry develop.   The presence of Testosterone both masculinizes and defeminizes the male brain, while the lack of testosterone leads to female development. But why isn't the developing male affected by the mother's circulating estrogen? This is due to a protein called alpha fetoprotein (I'm going to call it AFP). AFP binds to estrogen and doesn't allow it to pass through the blood brain barrier, protecting males from their mother's estrogen. AFP is also key in the difference between male and female neural development.   Testosterone and Estrogen are both steroid hormones derived from cholesterol, and Testosterone is the precursor to estrogen. That being said, one can be converted into another. AFP binds up estrogen, preventing it from getting in, but Testosterone can get past, and masculinize/ defeminize the brain.   It's actually estrogen receptors that cause the masculinization- Testosterone gets converted to Estrogen, then acts on estrogen receptors at the sites of neural development. So in protecting the female fetus from being exposed to its mother's estrogens, as well as its own, the female brain does not get masculinized. While males, who have testosterone which AFP does not bind, are also protected from endogenous estrogens, they still become masculinized due to the Testosterone being converted to estrogen once it is at its target site.   So to actually answer your question: (and keep in mind, these things are all still being researched) It does force a child down a road one way or another. However, whether the child is able to fully go down that road due to the organizational effects of hormones (either masculinized with the presence of T, or feminized by the absence of it) is what will make that road either easy or hard.   After all of the developmental stuff is over with, then comes the question of gender identity and hormone therapy. I don't know exactly what type of intersex OP was born with (there are many), but essentially, if in the first 8 week of development his neural development underwent masculinization, then it would likely be "easier" for him to be male in the long run, and testosterone hormone injections would be the better choice (and if his brain was feminized, then estrogen would be the better choice). It all comes down to how they feel in their own skin.
1	To be fair he didn't remove that to "hide" that specific thing. He had removed everything from his Facebook at that time. I doubt anyone gonna hide something after a full month.   He's allowed to say what he said there. That's not toxic, that's his opinion. Not everyone agrees with suicide.   And frankly, her last post where she said she would suicide she started off with "
1	Hi. I just wanted to pop in and say something.   In the comments, I'm noticing a lot of criticism towards female players in the thread--this is something to be expected but is somewhat skewed. I have found that ladies who push the fact that they were endowed with boobies tend to fall under the stereotypes which a lot of people are expressing. These ladies are toxic to the real female gaming community--a community, which, in short usually does not express their gender just as many of you would not express your gender as it is  irrelevant .   Female players are quite common, but the reason many people fail to realize this fact is because most of us keep our heads down because it feels like in large part the really vocal girls are either stupeyfaces (example as posted above) or militant about how girls are discriminated against. This is rather frustrating and I find both to be toxic and counterproductive.
1	It's depends on if say your vs tank top and jungler who just dive you that with tri or botrk if your good at kitting and it works so well ( the passive  does not work with furor boots thou or Ashe q I believe ) but all depends I feel in gold it works well but I'm shit at this game anyway :))
0	I live in Texas, and as a "black guy that isn't really black, like, you know?" the confederate flag has always made me feel uneasy. I have heard many excuses defending it's display like, -It's just a southern pride thing -The south was going to abolish slavery eventually anyway     The civil war wasn't about slavery, it was about the central government becoming too strong.    I'm a redneck lol.    etc. Now, I'm not the kind to get so easily offended by things, but I can't help but narrow my eyes and think less of someone publicly displaying that flag. Furthermore, that flag is a symbol, and a symbol's interpretation is decided by each individual, not you.      In other words, if you are proud to be southern, that's fine and I encourage people to continue being proud of their cultural identity. If you have some political views that you would like to express to others, that's fine and dandy too, but can we at least try to express ourselves in ways that don't offend others? Can we at least acknowledge the fact that the Confederate flag has come to represent hatred, slavery, and the Jim Crow laws. Not to mention associated with the KKK.
1	They are better at an individual level, but inferior in rotating, gameplans and warding (all 3 of which are obviously connected). In the past, players from the east used to be way way better mechanicly and won games off of that, but now NA/EU players can hold up in 1v1s/2v2s (not beat them, but still) and then outrotate them.   Also, chinese teamfighting sucks. At least SHRCs and OMGs, EDG is usually really good. The myth that chinese teamfighting is good is just plain wrong, they are just individually so good that they see "everything" and always react right... just applying logic: How are 3 chinese and 2 korean players supposed to communicate well, especially in stressed out situations like teamfights?
0	Adapting" is a much more objective approach than "being oneself" would be. As a person like OP, when I socialize with others I'll likely feel apathetic about everything they have to say, but I'll mimic enthusiasm/ interest/disdain/etc. to you know, fit in or whatever. Now I know everybody does this to an extent, but in my experience it has gotten to a point that I do this with everyone all the time, even my family. I'm well liked amongst many different cliques and social groups, but I don't feel close to anyone really. Every interest that I've developed over the years has been tailored to impress others, every mannerism artificial and changeable. Being a good liar really helps this too.
1	Disclaimer: I main support and jungle and all of this is opinion.   The important thing about playing aggressive supports is that both people bot lane need to realize, carries are not the real important players bot lane, the supports are. Supports will be making most of the decisions and starting most of the plays. ADC's are just there for damage.   Taric is an amazing offensive support, its just all about how you choose to play him. If you want to be aggressive get a couple dazzle shatter combos off early and they will be scared to initiate on you, then you'll be able to decide when to start fights.   Leona is a great offensive support. Zenith Blade in Daybreak the ADC (or support if you so choose) activate eclipse and you're home free. Daybreak also makes for great disengage so you really have control of when you fight. And if an enemy drops a ward in your face, you can clear it before it disappears.   Assuming blitz isn't banned he's usually a safe pick. Just rocket grab, power fist to initiate.   Now you also have to think; What is a support? The ones i listed before are conventional supports, but you can play most champions that have CC, auras, heals, shields.   One of my favorite supports is Jarvan. His Knockup and attack speed buff are amazing for the ADC, and as long as you don't "help" Cataclysm is pretty useful for zoning out the enemy ADC.
1	First of all you should have ran cleanse because they were running some strong cc. You cannot afford to get initiated on by shens taunt and be debuffed by the damage reduction or get stunned by sona or feared by nocturne. Your net , your trap and your range should be enough to keep the divers at bay. In these cases placing a trap infront of you and microing around it makes it even harder for champions like those to go on you because they will get snared ( even if noct ults he gets snared ). Choose your targets wisely at first taking precautions about what cooldowns the enemy team has on their skillset. You knew Nocturne had randuins so you should not even try to get close to him or focusing him because it would lead you to get AS debuffed. Shen on the other hand can be "ignored" after he taunts. You can probably take a couple of hits from him and still be at like 55-65% at the end of a small skirmish. The main problem would be when both of them initiate on you. They become sort of an unkillable duo flying through the air which could take you down with ease. The only way to avoid getting focused is to not grow aggro or have an escape plan. You need to stay far when the teamfights initiate so that you become less prioritized over your teammates. This makes them focus them and not you and gives you free shots at them or maybe the other carries. If they do initiate on you anyways you need to have an escape plan up your sleeve. Net over a wall or flash, go into a bush to loose sight , place some traps etc...   Edit:
1	I don't know about others, but my game experience on eu-w has been very bad lately. I realized i was ignoring 3+ persons every game, and some champs are unplayable or a hinderance to your team.   There are bugs like the dmg on recall still applying but not stopping the recall, and a bunch of bugs like that that have been around since 2010.   Most of the items are overnerfed or useless in a normal game, flash is still mandatory, ranged adc are still mandatory (if you want to raise your % win chance ofc).   We still have to wait 2 minutes before the game starts to have some action, baron is still impossible to ignore and try to win while the other team is at it still makes no sense. Afk problem is still unresolved, despite the fact that someone joins late almost every game. After some dota 2 games i can say about half of the lol games wouldn't even start after the connection check if they were to adopt that system.   But what i dislike more is how the game has made innovation almost nonexistent, today "innovation" means start to play some champs that were good 2-3 patches ago and now they are playable again after some changes. Innovation as far as build are concerned is impossible, every champ has got forced into an "ad" or "ap" build style, apart from some, most of which are unplayed/unplayable. Adcs always play with the same opening, same runes, same build path.   Laning is neutered, games almost always go to 40+ mins, it all boils down to who gets first 2 mid turrets, then wards enemy's jungle looking for picks, then siege as 5 when someone is dead, then get baron and win. Always the same, it's not possible to create a different winning strategy, unless you are so far ahead as a team that you can ignore baron and win straight away.   Never since i started playing have i been so bored with the game, and most of my friends shared this concept with me, without me even asking for it.   Oh i met people playing with scripts too, the famous cassio script 2 times, 1 time the ryze script. Co-op games are filled with bots. Dominion is a joke since its release. There still are champs with 0 skillshots, and they even see some play at the top level.   After urf was disabled i realized the game is in this state cause riot wants it to stay this way, should it really be so difficult to buff/change champs like maokai and let him see some play? Or nautilus? Or galio?  Vel koz was released and guess what? He can't kill people from full to 0 in 1-2 seconds like the other "viable" top champs, he has no dash/jump ability. He will be probably get forgotten like my loved viktor.   I am taking a break right now, it's not funny anymore to play 45 mins games while everyone is flaming everyone and closing games feels like giving birth to a child.   Sorry for the rant, i used to love this game, always hoping for those many many problems to be resolved, but i don't see it happening anytime soon. 2 cents of a noob gold player.
1	The part you got wrong: He didn't screw up, but did it intentionally. He explained on youtube(in the comments) that he was sure Blitz would silence him before he could use Zhonya, so he cancelled the teleport.
1	I like how they try to calm everyone down by saying that the reports are saved and will worked out eventually even though the tribunal is down.   With 2 reported people per average in a normal EUW platinum game I wonder how many ppl RIOT hires to work out all those reports with a few thousand reports per  day .   I don't want to sound too negative...but they can't even catch up with the amount of people that need to be banned since the tribunal is down. There are just too many of them. Which means your average game on EUW will be toxic as hell for the next few months until they finally bring back a solution for this.   Not sure if I want to play for the next few months with people wishing me diseases, death and other things, have sex with my mother/father/pet, call me whatever insult they find on www.insults-for-retards.com, forcing dodges with "role X or feed", forcing dodges by banning useless champs/not banning at all "to make it more entertaining", feeding, afking, leaving, trolling or simply being negative as hell.
1	I think champ sales have something to do with balancing. We had for a while three AD carries playing 80% of all games at a very wide range of ELOs with Ezreal being the most played. This makes it so people will buy and play fewer AD carries. Also they, and we alike, prefer having variety. Seeing the same three people in most games was getting stale. If you paid attention to the crowd in the World Finals, you would notice they got excited when somebody picked anybody who wasn't one of the holy trinity. They would show someone like Tristana or Ashe, and there would be cheers. Then they would lock in Ezreal, and the crowd would be let down. Notice they left alone what makes Ezreal stronger than an attack speed slow. They left alone his low cool-down long-range blink. If you ask most people, that's what breaks him. His W is just a perk.
0	So my auntie mother is mentally disabled and doesn't really grasp the concept of how much money she has all too well. Me and my family (legally) took control of her bank account and now we regulate how much money she gets and make sure she has some extra to spend when she wants it. All is well and fine until you add in my cousin.   My cousin is a special kind of asshole. He fully knows about her disability and inability to really comprehend a lot. So he told her that he wanted to get Sky (basically cable in the UK) but we told him no. He took her bank card and ordered it anyway (the £45/month contract which is $73/month). There are 2 problems here. 1) My auntie only gets all of her money off of welfare. Not a lot. 2) He bought and signed for it in her name.   As soon as we saw this we quickly shut it down. So he made threats towards us that he would call the police and we told him that he can do that if he wants. He did and it all got explained to them by both parties. Now we're just sorting out all of the aftermath.
1	im new on reddit what does
0	Just had this happen. Except we actually were intimate at the beginning for a couple of months until she said she wasn't ready for a relationship and wanted to work on the friendship. I posted what's below in a similar Advice Animals topic yesterday. The kicker is, I keep feeling somewhat guilty about how things played out and feel like I should reach back out at some point. Damn emotions.   >"This is how I should have operated. I reconnected with a woman I went to school with and we dated for a few months and were intimate. She then said she wanted to slow things down and work on the friendship and work up to a relationship. I offered to back off but ended up going along with it and settled for "more than friends". We only saw each other a few times over the next few months but kept up the texting, flirting, hypothetical talk about the future (marriage jokes, kids, pets, etc). Finally, she basically stops talking to me before and after my birthday (I saw her for that). I call her on it and she said she doesn't talk to any of her friends every day and is more comfortable slowing things down.   >I was pretty hurt by that and didn't talk to her for a couple weeks. Finally sent her a message saying that I hope she finds the right guy, that the mixed signals hurt, and that I'd like to be friends in the future. Never heard back.   >Texted her this past weekend to see how she was doing and see if some stuff on Facebook and Pinterest was her trying to send a message (Protip: It wasn't). But said she still wanted to be friends but pushed me away because I took her flowers when I went to see her for my birthday. Said it was too much. I said since we were "more than friends" that whole time I hadn't thought that flowers were over the line. I told her I still wanted to be friends, and was trying, but that it had been tough to just switch to viewing her as a friend after hanging on to that idea of being more for so long (not to mention having it seem mutual). She wrote back again saying that I made us out to be more than we were and I was coming on too strong now too.   >Well ouch. My point I was trying to make is that I'm cool with it if she doesn't want a relationship, I just wish she'd expressed it in a less painful way. Instead she tried to make me out to be clingy :/   >Feeling pretty gutted and misunderstood, I told her I was just making things worse and stopped texting. Typing it all out here makes no difference but it's cathartic. It's just a frustrating situation."
0	www.bosley.com   Within a matter of months my ex began to lose so much hair he thought he was going to have to shave his head. He went to Bosley out of desperation. The visit (and yearly follow-ups!) was free. He didn't qualify for the transplant because he had all-over balding, but he was given a prescription for Propecia. Within one year the balding had stopped and he had regrowth in previously balding areas. Within 2 years his hair was much thicker. Now 4 years later you can't even tell. His hair makes him look like a Disney prince. Seriously.
0	Tests, quizzes, and homework are SPECIFICALLY geared towards testing comprehension of the what you have learned IN THE CLASSROOM, not about the right answer by any means. It's not really about pace. The same way you would get points off if you're supporting facts in an essay from Wikipedia instead of the chapter's reading you had been going over.   It doesn't make sense to have to write "Using the methods we learned in class" on every question on every homework, quiz, and test in every class for every grade. Phrasing it as a "wrong answer" would be misleading and untrue, but you still can't get points for using improper methods. Obviously the method isn't wrong, it just wasn't the method being tested. A point off in first grade isn't a big deal, but the lesson will be important for the rest of her graded life.
1	Wickd picked Trundle as 2nd-pick. It is very safe to assume that with the current meta the enemy will pick at least one tanky champion, so the pick was totally reasonable imho.   Fnatic ofc tried to counter that with the LB pick. That is not Wickds fault. I am sure they decided the, imho reasonable, Trundle-pick as a team.   So in the end Wickd ends up heavily countered in lane, countered as a champion in general because they had no super tank as an enemy which trundle would like and camped by a lee during whole laning. Still he managed to go dead-even in lane and utilize his champion as far as the circumstances allow (good TPs, good meat, good pillars).
0	As a sailor let me explain. I've been to many races where they've canceled/delayed because of how much wind because when there's too much wind you're basically leaning out so much you have your head in the water the entire time, or you capsize.   At the Junior Olympics race on the Puget Sound it was around 25-30 knots. I turtled before a race and ended up spending 5 minutes trying to right it (the waves and wind kept pushin me over), I ended up getting a coach to help me. I came in 10th to last.   One thing to note which is off topic, is that everyone trains in different winds, and that low wind sailing and high wind sailing are two different things. I was lucky to have a US champion coach who taught us how to sail in all winds, so this wasn't a problem; but in low wind races I've seen people quit because they didnt know how to sail I'm slow winds.   Edit: I sail Laser Radials if anyone's interested.
0	Middle school, 8th grade, 2001-2002, crowded hallway between classes.   I am making my way towards my class with all haste. Better to get to class than deal with the chaos of the halls. Forced to slow down behind two incredibly slow girls chatting it up. By slowing down I mean slamming on the brakes because they merged out into the hallway without bothering to check. The plan was to wait for an opening amd hit the accelerator. The plan was not for one of the girls hands to be slightly behind her as I made my move. Now I didn't see the hand. My intention was to clip past quickly without touching, no big deal.   Her hand touched my junk and grabbed hold. She let go very quickly and let out a long "ewwwww". I continued past.
1	Nah, I just don't like how Riot wants to play god over their own league, sometimes fining for a specific "offense" and sometimes they let it be. They are clearly disregarding their own rules whenver they feel like it.
0	My grandparents started a college account for me the day I was born. We were going to take a loan to build my credit, but because they had just enough money saved to put me through 4 years of uni living at home, we decided against it because of the interest. If not for them, I would have never had a chance at an education past high school. My parents aren't in a good position financially, but they try.   Now I'm getting a little off topic, but they also gave me my grandfathers 2000 toyota camry xle when he bought a new car about a month ago, because I was driving a beat up truck that sucked down gas like no other. I don't know where I would be today if not for their unconditional love and generosity. I work full time and go to uni full time at night, but every chance I get, I go up there, work for them around the house, and have dinner. I try to go at least twice a week. There will never be a day that I don't appreciate them, and I make sure they know it anytime I can. They won't be here forever, so I make absolute sure to cherish every moment.
0	Thanks for the correction, I was not aware of that. The only way I could find for a young employee in this situation to make a complaint is the last section from here:   "An employment policy or practice that applies to everyone, regardless of age, can be illegal if it has a negative impact on applicants or employees age 40 or older  and is not based on a reasonable factor other than age ."   Link is to the actual law and I am not about to dig through that right now :p     My example: Young employee, who is very qualified for the position,  is considered for promotion to manage a team with older people (some would have to be over 40). Company says they think he is too young to manage the older people for yada reason so they choose a less qualified older person to take the job.   The point of attack here is that by putting the less qualified person in charge the company is putting the older employees on the team at a disadvantage as the less qualified manager may not help them perform as well as they could have had the younger employee been made their manager.   Realistically, though, this is a weak argument and anecdotal but is the best chance as far as I have seen in my limited reading into the subject. I do not think this would succeed.
0	Story time.  I'll give the shortened version here.   My ex from over ten years ago contacted me.   At the time, had been living with my fiancée for over 9 years.  The last time I spoke to my ex AT ALL was 9 years before.  He had been hoping to rekindle something.  At that time, I told him I had met someone, and that I wouldn't be able to start seeing him again.   On Christmas, my neighbor stops me in the stairwell, asking me if I knew a guy named Tim (my ex).  Being that I have never spoken to my neighbors more than to say "good morning", I told him I knew Tim, and I wondered how HE knew I knew Tim.  He sidestepped the question, mentioning to me that he was a relative of Tim's, and that Tim wanted to get in touch with me, and that he left me something. 😳   It was a fairly innocuous holiday card, no big deal,  but still it creeped me out that Tim had a) found out where I lived, and b) hand-delivered a card to my neighbors house, when he definitely had my cell phone number (and my address, now) and could reach me through a number of mutual friends.  Weird.   I decided to send him a text, thanking him for the card and asking him how it came up that I lived next door to his "relative".   He told me: "you should just know that I have eyes everywhere".   Fuck.   I mentioned all that had transpired up until that point to my fiancée, out of instinct more than anything.  I had a feeling some shit was about to go down.   I began getting creepy texts.  They were advancing in nature, but nothing super inappropriate, just asking to "go for a drink", or sending "invites to see his office", which I declined.  I began outright ignoring him.   One day, I got a text from Tim mentioning that a mutual friend was in an accident recently and might have died.  I responded to that text, saying how awful it was.   He took that opportunity to start hitting on me again.   Fuck.  I had to do something.   I told him that I was sorry If I was unclear, but I would not be seeing him.  I told him that I am about to be married, and that I thought he would have known that considering that he contacted me through my neighbor, who knows I live with my fiancée.  I apologized for that confusion.   He said it was cool, that he would leave me alone.   Awesome....or so I thought.   About a week later, I get a ring at my doorbell.  I ask who it is, and it's a girl.  She is asking for me by my full name.   I snatch the door open, thinking I am being served or something.  This girl, who I wouldn't know from any random asshole, claims to know me from college, and she wants to hang out.  I'm like "who the fuck are you?", when my ex jumps out from behind the corridor, smiling like a jackass.   I FREAK OUT and slam the door in their faces.  My fiancée is freaking out, asking WTF was that about.  I told him it was the guy who hand delivered a card to the apt, and he goes out after them to tell them to fuck off.  The girl goes running away but my ex just stood there and said nothing.   I am still looking over my shoulder to this day.
1	Probably because you got carried in promo's and your mmr isn't high enough for Dia 5? That's the logical answer.
0	I used to HATE spiders to death, and then I moved into the small studio where I am at now. To say I have spiders here is an understatement. The most popular variety is the simple daddy long leg. I have at any one time about a dozen to twenty of these guys living all around my place. Little babies hatching all over. I think they are pretty adorable these days. My wild pets! The are so clumsy and scared of everything except other insects and spiders.   So there are those guys and gals and then I occasionally get wandering spiders like the one in this picture. Red violin backed or something. They are super feisty little guys who are completely fearless. They have amazing eyesight and will track you with their front legs up like "Wut". I admire their bravery and their method of just straight hunting their prey. Little marauders.   There is one type under my sink that I have no idea wtf it is. A blacker spider about the size of a quarter or so. It does not attack my foot when I do dishes but will pop out if something lightly vibrates its web. It's the illest in-house spider I have. Looks like a mini black hobo but with a smaller backside. No red hourglass on the underside. It almost caught this cricket the other night. That was one scarred ass cricket. Never made a peep when it was in my apt for fear that a million spiders would jump its ass. It  knew  it had walked into the lion's den. I've never seen a cricket move around a kitchen more carefully.   That brings me to a funnier point. I almost welcome outside pests into my studio at this point. It's like the Dungeon Keeper game in real life. I have my trained predators ready to strike. Insects know what's up. Creep under the screen door like "Dafuq? Aww shit NOOOO!!."   If I didn't leave the daddy long legs alone my studio would be insect kingdom. I learned that the hard way the first year here by removing all the spiders as I found them. Now I see them fr what they truly are ... they are my first line of defense from outdoor insects. I would way rather have them than a bunch of other insects roaming around including more nasty spiders.   [Here's]( a cool video of a daddy long leg - same variety as the ones in my studio - taking out a black widow. They are thin and clumsy, but they  do not  f*ing play around. Also I think they are cannibals. Very territorial. I get to watch the drama unfold as the younger ones vie for dominance and the best spots. Survival of the fittest. Have generations of these suckers.   These days I go so far as to save the ones in the shower. I feel bad, they are just babies starting out on life and idk I just feel they should have a sporting chance. Plus they help me out so it is in my best interest to keep them alive.   I am not up to beast master level yet - I couldn't be cool with holding a tarantula but ya never know maybe one day.   For the record I am not some gross mofo. My place is clean I just have no AC so in the summer the doors and windows stay open so I might as well live outside. Screens only do so much to prevent insects from getting inside. They are determined little bastards. Some flying beetle thing will regularly push its enormous body through these pencil-eraser sized holes that is my metal screen door. I have no idea how they do it. Some get stuck and simply die in the screen. :/   Also I am terrified of insects normally. Spiders are really my first insect love and its only been over the last two years. I now see them  exactly  like this photo which is why I felt I had to respond with the story of my life.
0	We are arguing semantics. I have no interest in creating a bunch of words that represent every single kind of sexuality (Hexapolykindasexual) because that would be impractical. When I say language, I just mean the way we communicate the complexity of the situation. In normal conversation with someone you just met, just say what makes you feel comfortable. No need for a debate, but when someone wants to open a conversation and say "sexuality is simple" I am going to point out that it is not.   If people are asking you which gender you prefer, that means that they are looking for a dichotomy. That in itself proves a lack of understanding. It sounds like they are trying to prove that you are either gay or straight. Your anecdote reveals quite the opposite of what you are suggesting. Is it really that big of a deal that people are ignorant of the complexity of sexuality? No, I am not on a crusade to attack people who disagree with me.   To answer your question, i would say "you are 75% interested in men and 25% interested in women." Why do we even have to have a word for that. We can't come up with words for every possible scenario. It is just fine to say "I am bi." There is nothing wrong with that.
1	His AD carrying might be bad though because of his low (comparatively) range of 475.  If you got basic AD Carry build, but with manamune and hurricane first, you could probably do really well.  The problem is getting there when other people have a better early game and have more range for harassing.  If you go top, there will be some champs that stomp you, and others you can stomp.  I'm not sure how Thresh would do mid, but don't think it would generally be very viable.  I think top would be best, or bot if you had a really good support, and the other person didn't pick urgot or some other earlygame lane bully.   I've never personally played as Thresh, but I think he could potentially be a really good AD carry if you could get through the laning phase.  He initially has craptastic armor and magic resist, but can get higher resistances once he gets lots of souls, so he can potentially get a lot of extra damage and tankiness lategame.  I feel that unless you have an unconventional support (such as pantheon, shaco etc.) that can put a lot of pressure on the other person early on without items, you probably will not be able to come out ahead of the opposing ad carry, and will likely be behind for a while.  You also need to get up close to the dying minions, and the other people will likely harass you when you go for a soul often enough that you will not be able to get all souls and still lane well.
1	I think you missed the point made in the video. You shouldn't be berating things that you dislike simply because they're there and popular. That's what the upvote and downvote arrows are for. The moment you start insulting those with differing opinions is the moment you start thinking of yourself as above the community, rather than a part of it. Like the video says, if you want the community to change, then be the change yourself.   If you want serious discussions, suggestions, and complaints on this subreddit, go find them and upvote them. Leave a constructive comment that adds to the thread's development.   The type of content that was here 2 years ago is still here. The front page content has just changed to threads and links more easily consumed by the glancing redditor, e.g. funny bugs, changes, and montages. This doesn't make them bad, you just might prefer more thought provoking topics.
1	To be perfectly honest i love facing Fiora as a top laner. Yes she becomes untargetable when she ults but thats why you learn how to counter play it. I personally like to take someone like a shen or lissandra against her and grab exhaust. When she dashes towards me i either e-taunt her right away as shen so that she takes a lot of minion aggro and i automatically win the trade or of I'm liss i w-stun her as soon as she comes in and then auto q auto kite. If I'm irelia, i e-stun then w and q away. If she comes close to me again i do the same, yes she may put dmg onto me but she can only kill you with her ult if you're low in health and if thats the case be prepared to exhaust her as soon as she dashes in because she will ult.
0	I could be a jerk and condescend you, but instead I'll let you know that most men think extremely highly of women and that you're just looking for reasons to be angry.   You're basically r/atheism in feminist form. Unless you're living in some kind of oppressive country where as being a woman you're always being harassed, then you have no right to complain. The thought of a woman getting what she deserved (take note of this post) is different than the thought of wishing that on other women, which I would be willing to bet is virtually non-existent.
1	Yeah, I'll be honest and say that I've had the dream. I literally dreamed about winning Worlds, I've dreamed about streaming with 40k+ viewers, I've dreamed about posting on Reddit and copping 30 upvotes instantly just because  holy shit that's that pro player!  I've dreamed about being the first Australian team to make it big, I've dreamed about holding top spot in NA and AU servers, I've dreamed about the "Australian LCS" and not dropping a single game in the qualifying rounds.   Unfortunately, last year, just as I was starting to get really good at the game (not trying to boast, I was improving steadily and it didn't seem like I was going to stop any time soon), my life got flipped upside down. Loss of loved ones, financial issues, depression, anxiety, stress, the whole nine yards. I essentially gave up league for 3 months, and when I came back I was playing with the skill of a low-silver player, when I know I was playing at Platinum or higher level in S2.   After getting back into League, I managed to bring myself up to a respectable skill level (though, I will admit, I fuck up fairly often), but realised that I will probably never be able to make my way into a team. I can't start one - most of my Australian friends who play this game are quite bad, and, in truth, have toxic attitudes. Those that don't either only play semi-casually or have quit the game... for example, my mate Lewis - he essentially taught me how to play the game. When I first met him he had some 600 wins and I was level 12. He took me under his wing and we've played well over a thousand games together. Without him I'd likely still be playing at a bronze level. And yet, he hardly plays anymore. The game isn't fun to him - solo queue is depressing as hell, and playing with a premade 5 is just as depressing because, as I said, our friend group who plays Leauge is a harsh combination of lack of skill and terrible attitude. Their inability to learn purely due to stubbornness makes it incredibly difficult to play with them and so he doesn't. He's gone from playing 5-10 games a day to maybe one or two a day, every couple days. On the odd night where we have 4+ in mumble, we'll play up to 5 games, but most of them are losses and it just ruins his morale. I still remember him boasting about having roughly 200 more wins than losses in normals - his normal elo used to get us matched up with 2.4ks, it was horrible and terrifying but a learning experience.   Because he's lost his motivation, I doubt he'd ever want to be in a team, let alone with people he likely doesn't know.   I also have huge trust issues, and can be very critical at times. I dunno if it's the anxiety or what, but even with people who I've played 50+ games with, I feel as if everyone is selfish and they're trying to take all of my CS, steal all of my buffs, take all of my experience, deny me everything and basically do whatever it takes to make me worthless, even if this isn't the case. Because of this, teams that I've tried out for, despite doing extremely well (my mid Jarvan is so fucking scary), I was dropped for someone who had weaker stats.   Another friend of mine, Jack, came from DotA and SC2 and started maining support in League. In less than 3 months he started playing with the knowledge of a gold player and I was really excited to pick him up and put him on my back in hopes of throwing a team together. Having an AD/Mid player (Lewis), Jungle/mid player (me) and a support main (Jack) is much more appealing than just AD/Mid and Jungle/Mid. Unfortunately, Jack switched back to Starcraft, and hasn't played League in nearly 2 months.   Boom. Hopes of a team gone.   I'll dream about becoming a professional until this game dies. I know I have the skill; I know I have the knowledge; I know I have the determination; I know I have the mindset; I know I have the potential... but I also know that it's incredibly unrealistic due to the terrible situation I'm in.
1	Thing is, nobody really likes the fact some champions might have the 'same' passive and the 'bush passive' is already taken.   I don't see what could be next besides 'river' or 'water' interaction but water area are far less spread out in the map than bushes.
1	Because it is Zed and Talon. 2 burst mid lane AD Caster/Assassins.   Winrate doesnt mean everything, when will people learn that? Zed is commonly seen as the better talon. Talon has a 4.74% pick rate and a 0.55% banrate. Zed has a 13.19% pickrate and a 38.38% banrate.   The only people that really play Talon now a days are the people who are really good at him and main him despite his e nerf. Therefore he has a suspiciously high winrate because most people who don't play Talon OR Zed are more likely to pick Zed over Talon which for one brings down zed's winrate falsely and brings up Talon's winrate the same.   Zed's closest comparisons are LB and Talon. Talon because he is an all in AD caster mid laner, and LB because she has dashes that let her swap back to start and spells that do more damage with proper comboing and procs.   In this case you want a reason to pick Zed, so becasue he is AD and can splitpush well. Talon also has these same benefits, thus why I am comparing him to talon.   The big reason to pick Zed over Talon is the safety. You STILL have that reason even if you have to fight for 1 second after you ult. It is better to have a free escape after 1 second then none at all.   The "very different situation" is that Talon got gutted and his identity as an Anti Mage removed with no compensation where as Zed is overtuned, highly banned, highly picked, and trying to be toned down without gutting him like they did Talon.   If they removed his ability to go back to the Ult shadow entirely that would take out the reason to pick him over talon, that would kill his identity, very much like taking Talon's Silence.   Be grateful that it has only come to this and not further.
0	My younger brother is constantly manipulating our mother into getting his way. I told her about this once, and how he insults me and her when she's not around, and how he uses our grandmother's gullibility to make himself seem like the victim in every possible situation in order to gain her sympathy so that he can continue this. I was yelled at for a solid 2 hours. My little brother came in later to insult me further about trying to rat him out.
0	Some alarm on my iPod went off in the middle of class recently. I must have set it with my face while I was asleep or something, because it was set for 11:42am and had never gone off before. I let it go off for 30+ seconds before I realized it was mine. I hope everyone in class forgave me... If you're exaggerating with the 3 minutes part, maybe that's what happened to this guy.
1	I posted this elsewhere, since this has been brought up multiple times, but:   I do think that someone being able to feed you neutral timers is an advantage. However, I feel that realistically - it's relatively insignificant. Yes, your friend could sit there and watch your games and give you timers, but honestly in most decent Elo ranked games, you already know what those timers are. Maybe not to the second, but you'll have a basic idea. That's not the kind of advantage that will win the game for you.   The amount of effort it would take in exchange for what you would gain would make it a little silly to do this consistently. People might do it once in a while (especially now since it was just released) and it's distasteful, but it's a fairly minor exploit in exchange for a very powerful feature.
0	I didn't put this in my first comment merely because I knew it would be perceived wrong, but try to bear with me and think about it before you click the little down air to the left.   Every single joke ever made offends someone somewhere. Every. Single. One. It might seem petty of some people to be offended by some jokes, but there are those out there who would truly get upset at the most trivial of jokes. The way I  personally  see it, we need to realize this. We need to understand that our jokes will offend somebody out there. We need to realize that limiting ourselves to the demands of others limits our own creative mind. Therefore, we need to push past. We need to understand that we're offending somebody, and just get over it. If we don't do that, then we restrict ourselves from all forms of humor. If we tell ourselves that we can't tell jokes because others get upset, we lose laughter.   Now, we move into more offensive jokes. Jokes that have the potential to offend many people in large groups. What do we do then? Personally, I still enjoy saying fuck it. Some people really and truly need to learn to "get over it" when it comes to "offensive" humor. Yes, bad things happen. I understand that you've lost relatives, or have been mentally/physically tortured  by this, that, and another. But in order to evolve, we need to accept change. The concept of "too far" simply shows an unwillingness to break past that barrier.   "Too far" is only brought upon a group or individual when the joke offends  everyone . Usually, though, these individuals are regarded as idiots and/or mentally unstable folks, and are disregarded because nobody really wants to hear their opinion anyway. Just look at the Westboro Baptist Church. They offend everyone. Their "too far"(ness), however, is widely disregarded. Those instances that aren't met with disregard are met with backlash, and the offending group/individual usually suffers for it. Therefore, "too far" still doesn't really apply.   So to sum it up: we need to realize that we're offending someone. We need to decide (for ourselves) whether or not these jokes are appropriate for the time and place that they are being told. Some people will get offended, and that's okay. People just need to realize the humor in jokes and overcome their own misgivings.
1	Rock,   1- neutral camps dont count towards cs retard   2- check the lolking profile moron, im at 1377 with only ranked 5s played this season, so what does that tell you if after the reser i ended up in 1377?   3- check the s2 stats moron and take your pick on what role i actually main
0	Started dating when we were 18.  Married at 21.  We were pretty great together, and seemed like we had a lot of common life goals and ideals.  Specifically around family.  We both very much wanted kids, and I worked hard to excel in my career so I could be the provider if she chose to be a stay at home mom.  The initial goal was to be financially stable and in a house prior to bringing kids into the picture.  We figured around the time we were 26ish.   We bought too much house at the height of the market, and have been upsidedown since just after moving in...   She started to get really frustrated with work herself.  And was more upset that she didn't have a master's degree to move up in her company.  I put my education goals aside (we could only afford 1 master program at the time) in the hopes that shed be happier with work.   During this time, i started doing very well at work.  I put my bonuses to work on the house, uodating the kitchen, the lighting... put in wood flooring, etc.  We replaced both AC units and put in solar panels.   Even though I was reaching my goals, we had passed the point where we were going to start trying to have kids...  and I was getting frustrated myself.   One of the last things on our list to update was the backyard.  I designed it to have rock features, a fountain, nice pavers, and a small grassy area for a play set.   Sunk almost $12,000.   Shortly after the yard was complete, she told me she didn't want kids anymore.  She had been unhappy for a while, but didnt know how to talk to me about it because she hadnt known that she fell out of love.  Our sex life immediately ceased.  I moved my stuff into a guest room, and we began a 9 month process to determine where we were, and if there was anything left to save.  It became pretty clear that she wasnt sure what she wanted, and I was hoping it was an early midlife crisis that she would push through...   Ultimately, we looked at where we had come, evaluated where we were going, and determined neither of us would be happy if we stayed together.  Ive let go of the what I put into the house (it wasnt worth fighting and dragging things out).  Its been hard, but ive let go if the goals I set aside for myself (family and school) to try and make her happy.   And it is for the best.  Ive actually met someone much more in line with my goals.  We've been together for 5 months now.  And being past the early 20s growing phase, we are both confident that we know what we are looking for.  I just turned 30 and am confident I will have my family someday.   Note: I have no reason to beleive my ex-wife ever went outside the marriage.  I know she still hasn't really decided what she wants.  And I know from mutual friends that she hasnt started dating yet.  There are still financial obligations, but outside of that we dont talk much.
1	Lets start with runes: Page 1: Makes no sense, looks like you're going for a support page? The half-comittment runes do NOT work in this sense. If you are going magic resist for blues, go ALL the way, the 11 mana is useless in the short and long run. Change the gold/10, you get only 13 gold extra per minute which is barely enough if you're laning correctly. Armor is usually good here, or HP/level, call is up to you. Reds go all in on pen or flat ap/ad. Mana regen is again useless from what I'm seeing you're aiming for. Finally quints; this is OKAY if you want to run it, but better off going full hp or full move speed. Having minor bonuses really mean nothing.   Page 2: Ad page? Reds are fine. Blues and yellows are NOT optimized for AD. Usually these tend to be defensive/utility slots. If you're shooting for an ADC page; attack speed is good for both blues and yellows. Also flat armor is good for yellows while flat MR is good for blues. Quints with crit damage, this only works if you GET the crit, the vast majority of the time the rune would be completely usless. Get movespeed/health/flat ad/pen instead. You MAY have a random crit rune anywhere that gives you like 1% crit if you absolutely want that.   Page 3: Ap page, yeah? You do NOT want flat ap pure. That is just 100% silly. You are not doing yourself a favor for this minor burst in damage. If you're even slightly behind nothing will save you. Reds for AP are usually designed for penetration. You can get hybrid (my favorites) or just flat magic pen. Anything else here is pointless. Yellows should be either defensive in armor or hp/level. Best in slot for ap's. Blues can be flat ap if you wish, also CDR is good in slot along with magic resist. Dependent on your play style. I play very aggressive lane so I keep flat ap. The quints can stay ability power. HP also works to live through lane phase.   Page 4: A tanky page? Ad blues are NOTHING, better off getting MR since they provide WAY MORE mileage than 3 AD. If you're going tanky, you can swap the yellows for HP scaling for a bigger punch than the 9 armor or keep the 9 armor and swap your quints for movespeed/health for better mobility/tanking. Keep in mind defense gives more effective health, but health is health.   Page 5: ADC page I'm guessing? You need to roll with more lane minded runes instead of the long run since if you win lane you tend to win late. Reds should be AD for better cs'ing unless you want more pen if you trust in your csing and then get flat armor pen. Yellows are good to live with, can take attack speed also. For blues 1 random MR isn't going to cut it. Go all magic resist or attack speed, up to you. You  can  make the quints work, but better off going full. They would be better served to be move speed if you want to hunt people down, attack speed if you want win earlier, or ad to pack a harder punch. Keep in mind you need attack speed on one of the categories (blues/yellows/quints.)
0	Went to PF Chang's once and ordered orange peel shrimp and received beef. Told my waiter and he took it immediately back to the kitchen, nearly instantly a manager appears to apologize, tell me that my proper order will be out as soon as possible and that my meal is now free. As soon as the manager left my table my new food was already there.

0	Do NOT do this. He spent  wayyyy  too long in the fatal funnel. Slice your pie as far back from your corner as is practical, roll out when necessary (but don't step and roll out), and EXPLODE through the doorway. Do not put your weapon in a "cover" mode (i.e. position sul, high ready, low ready), have it ready to shoot at a target in your blind spot (in this video, 90 degrees left) IMMEDIATELY.
1	Rengar main with over 300+ games in ranked here, currently D4 on EUW (soon d3!).   I play him both top and jungle, and both in the assassin/bruiser style. I'm looking forward to his rework a LOT because I believe there are some things that aren't right in his design. He's made to go all in, to rush in and force trades, then to kite/chase and get his cooldowns back to follow with an empowered spell, or keept it and surprise burst with it.   Main issue is, most champs that are designed the same way have a tool that cries "Imma win this trade" (jax's E, trynda's taunt, fiora's parry, trundle's Q,riven's E, ...). In rengar's case, it's a slight armor and armor buff. To be frank this spell main purpose and why we're using it is only to build ferocity and deal some magic damages. That's another part that I'm starting to dislike about rengar, you only think about what empowered spell you will use, but as for your normal spells, you use them whenever they're ready without a second thought, since what you want is basically get those 5 stacks.   His passive is extremely satisfying and can make for some great plays, probably the best part of his kit. His auto attack reset also feels tremendously good.   His ult is great, as well, but it becomes too important mid/late game to rengar. Basically, you won't initiate/respond to a fight without your ult. It's like the current rengar is unable to take an efficient teamfight without his ult. His bola strike doesn't have the range to poke outside of the lane, and he has to take too many hits just to throw one (especially if he goes full AD).   I totally understand why people would want to nerf his ult or remove it, it's not fun at all to get initiated by something you can't respond to, and even more to get instakilled. Evelynn is currently in the EXACT same spot as rengar, and it could actually be much worse   Also last but not least, I'm really hyped up to test reworked rengar for his bola strike becoming a skillshot. It will make kiting from a distance possible, and skirmishes much better for rengar. Currently if there's a trynd/riven/jax/lee/riven/shyv/... running behind your back to get you, you have nothing beside your ult. This is the ONE part when playing rengar that is extremely frustrating, this means that if you get even slightly behind, you will get tower dived to death.
0	I couldn't find any articles with Google scholar, but here are some things I found on regular searches.   >Sumo wrestlers are a colorful and instructive exception. Big, big eaters and artifically obese, they look like prime candidates for heart disease and diabetes and would definitely fail the belt test. Nevertheless, Hamdy reports, they are 'extremely insulin sensitive and don't have hypertension' Body scans reveal that sumo wrestlers typically have little visceral fat, presumably because they exercise six to eight hours a day. Most of what hangs over their mawashis is subcutaneous fat. When they retire, however, if they keep eating, their visceral fat balloons. ^1   The page I pulled that from isn't very clear whether this quote comes out of an article in the February 2007 Discover magazine or from one of Doctor Oz's books... probably not the best source if it's the latter.   The following  sounds  like it came from a more scientific study, but the page I lifted it from doesn't give the name or links to the study, just says it came out of a 1993 edition of " Look Japan ".   >"Levels of uric acid and glucose usually increase when the  body puts on weight.  For both substances, the rikishi  tested only slightly higher than the control group,  averaging 93.9 milligrams per deciliter of glucose and  7.32 milligrams per deciliter of uric acid, as compared to  91.3mg/dcl and 6.1mg/dcl respectively for the control  group.  Not only were those values lower than expected,  they are well within the normal range, which means that,  in spite of appearances, sumo wrestlers are, from a  medical standpoint, quite healthy. ^2   It's hard to say if this agrees with my original statement. This study compared 18 "healthy" people to Sumo wrestlers. I don't know if healthy means average or if these people were more active/healthier than the general populous. Either way, the values with the sumo wrestlers were within standard ranges for healthy individuals.   1:  2:

0	My parents are Amway distributors and I can personally tell you skeptics/haters things, because I am really sick and tired of all the things people talk about it. My comment is mostly objective, as I've grown up in "Amway family" but probably won't have my Amway career (my reason is that I have a dream job I love doing) except using products. Anyway:   1) It's not a cult/sect/religious obsessive thing. It's a business involving people, and people are different. Some are aggressive, some calm etc... Amway does not teach and/or encourage forcing people to join them. My parents have a stable business built, earn enough money not to go to work and have a nice life and have many friends OUTSIDE of Amway, because they don't force people to do anything.   1a) It doesn't have to do anything with Christianity. As I said in part 1, Amway distributors may be Catholic and (as religious people might act)  want to do things in name of the Lord etc... Amway is also in Islamic/Hinduistic ... countries, so that's total bullshit. Again, mixing business and personal life is a mistake people do, not that of a system.   3) If you don't work, you won't get any money out of it. Simple as that. And it's a hard work too, but with (possible) great benefits. Whoever tells you of magical money-making opportunities is full of shit. [This]( comment describes why.   3a) I understand there is a lot of hatred towards this company, let me elaborate on that. This is based mostly on bad experiences of people with Amway business owners, because of passive aggression, forcing, religion, bending the rules of the system (saying you HAVE to buy things there)... There people have mostly joined in order to make money fast and easy (which is not possible, see point 3). When they fail at doing so, they call it a scam.   3b) Also, on buying CDs, tapes, books and attending seminars- what most of the critics hold a grudge against-it's not an obligation, but this is a business where you sell stuff and have contact with people, which many people are not born-ready to do perfectly. It's an acquired skill. These things are mainly there to help you with communicating skills, confidence and self-growth. It has nothing to do with Amway, it's about becoming a businessman (If you want solid proof, 99% of recommended reading books are from authors like Robert Kyosaki and Zig Ziglar, their works are bestsellers and read by people that neven even heard of Amway)   4) I like the products very much and I cant picture myself not using them, but that is of course very subjective. Although it's stupid not to use a product you like if you don't like a company, but whatever.
1	Yes, this is absolutely fair. Blind draft shouldn't count for much, the picking style is extremely noncompetitive. Draft pick is much better, but is still less competitive to ELO being hidden. The idea is to reward people who participate in the (casual) competitive section of LoL, because that is what drives the community forward. You had way over a month since the announcement of rewards, you could have ranked yourself since then. In fact, you STILL have time to rank yourself.
1	Yes he is good. Not the best, but not near as bad as everyone makes him out to be. His laser with death upgrade is an AOE long range nuke with a 325+.91AP ratio at level 5. His W is a AOE slow/stun that lasts for 1.5s. His ultimate does decent burst damage as well as strong DoT and a short silence that adds up to a total of 1050+2.3AP at level 3.  His passive provides him with an item that enhances his laser to retarded power levels and gives him 99 AP for 1000 gold only. He is hurt by his loss of an item slot, that much is true, but it usually isn't a huge issue. His short range and his cooldowns can be a problem if you don't manage them properly, and his skills can be hard to land consistently.
0	Time for a story. In 8th grade my class went to D.C. For a field trip. For people who haven't been there to go anywhere you have to walk through a metal detector with an armed guard next to it. We went there around  winter time so I went everywhere with my hands in my pockets to keep them toasty warm. Well we got up to one of the detectors I'm just moving on through with my hands in my pocket when I hear someone say something. I couldn't hear it so I kept moving (I spend a little too much time with my headphones up too loud with caused me to be a little hard of hearing). So anyway I take a couple more steps and then I hear something again and look over to see a big black guard looking towards me starting to get out of his chair. Does anyone have those moments where you think you didn't hear something then you realize what they said. Well I lean towards him (hands still in pockets) and ask, "What?" Just in time to realize he said, "You have nothing to say just take your hands out of your pockets". Well when I leaned in he reached down for his gun and is completely out of his chair coming towards me. Needles to say I panicked quickly pulled my hands out of my pocket he panicked started fumbling to quickly pull his gun out. I just stood there with my hands up and when he finally realized I was unarmed sat back down. I didn't have any guards come at me from then in (at least in that building) but I did keep notice the same guard kept ending up in the same room with me for the rest of that tour.
0	I had a similar situation, GF hated my friend for constantly making racist and rape jokes. We tried talking to him about it he ended up doing it more and tried to laugh it off. I told her Iv been friends with him for 10 years I know he says stupid stuff but he is a good guy Iv seen him help alot of people. I can't just abandon him. It didn't fly. Since then I have drastically cut back on drinking, quit smoking, got a $20K raise and started a side business. Your situation is different but mine somehow worked out.

IF you want a nice guy (even if it's not the guy who's being nice to you now)   DON'T be a bitch to said nice guy because you think he's just 'trying to get sex'   BECAUSE it makes nice people less nice.

0	I was at a gay bar in San Francisco last year. As a straight guy in a gay bar, it was actually quite nice. Drinks were two for one, but i made sure i didn't drink to much giving the situation i was in. What happened though, i remember there was a guy i was talking to, can't quite remember him but we talked for a good fifteen minutes while smoking a cigarette. The rest of the night i just hung out with my pals, and i would always catch this guy staring right at me, it really made me feel uncomfortable.
0	Can we go ahead and kill this already? Actual Advice Mallard and Malicious Advice Mallard are at least  funny  occasionally, but the entire reason I don't subscribe to fashion subreddits is so I don't have to hear arbitrary rules that people come up with on  clothing, of all things,  that they think everyone else should be following as well.
1	I really think the entire team is having a poor tournament, and it sucks, but that's part of any sport.  Sometimes you are slated to do well and any number of things goes wrong and you suck, shit happens.  I've heard and read so many people calling for TSM to bench Dyrus or Santorin, but that would be a terrible call.  It's not like any single player on TSM is doing well this tournament.   Can players not have one bad showing and still keep a spot? How the fuck do you expect players to have and develop synergy?  You can't just dump a player every single time something goes wrong.  Not to mention this is one single tournament, it's not like they played like this for a split.  Who do you bring in that's a free agent that immediately improves the team? Like OP said, it's a team play problem, and no player is going to survive 3-4 man ganks.   Every team has trouble spots, no matter how good.  You have to give them room to learn lessons and improve.  This and team won the last IEM and the NALCS.  Let them take their lumps and go into the next season with lesions learned.  As a long time TSM fan, there isn't anyone currently available that I would rather see go to world's than the current roster.  I would be genuinely upset if there was a roster change going into summer.
0	This happened to me once in college. Except it was one of those "one time in college I took mushrooms". After ordering the pizza, I proceeded to stare at the bumpy ceiling of my house which was making funny letters and shapes. After what seemed like hours, I had this urge to get up and walk downstairs (I lived in a split level house). As I walked down the stairs, I got to the landing where the door was and there was a man standing there. Im pretty sure he hadnt knocked or rang the bell yet. Not because I didnt hear it, but because the look he gave me. I could feel my face saying "why the hell is there a man standing in my door" mixed with shock, terror and confusion. His face responded with a look of "is this kid just standing at the door waiting for his pizza?"  We proceeded to stare at each other bewildered at what the hell is going on. Then he slowly lifts the pizza box in the middle of our gaze, and everything kinda snapped together. At which point I just handed him some cash and he walked away. Neither of us ever said a word.
1	no thats different, the way the lcs works is the spot is given to the players to begin with, however if those players sign contracts with a team that allows the team/orginazation full control of the roster and rights to the spot then this is where the orginzation can then sell a spot, most likely what happened in the case of cw to nip is that the players wanted to be part of a bigger orginazation, and with regards to quantic to cloud9 it is most likely they thought they would be better off on their own then being run by a big orginzation.
0	I don't "know", just like anything else I make an educated guess based on deduction and probability (strippers are typically eigther wearing to much make up or no make up at all [before/after a shift], they typically have a lot of glitter on them, they typically wear comfortable and covered clothing because the last thing they want is be stared at off the clock, they almost ALWAYS wear headphones whether they're listening to music or not because it's a deterrent (headphones are a subliminal message that says "I don't want to be disturbed"), most women (not all this is not a generalization) who go into stripping or sex do so because they have less of a moral objection with it (a lot of times because they were sexually abused as a child and learned from an early age that they have influence over others with their bodies and decide to use that as a trade, fewer women [men too] learn to like it because it's a very effective tool when used properly and gives them a sense of empowerment and skill/challenge), the other thing that's typical to sexual abuse is statistically the victim doesn't progress emotionally from the age in which they were "broken" and therefore a lot of strippers like childish things or associations like cartoonish designs/colors and childlike characteristics and mannerisms.   -I don't "convince" anyone, they like me because everyone has an intrinsic need to feel understood and since I'm more intelligent than most men they encounter I have a higher probability of understanding them and therefore knowing what they need/want and can satisfy them better than most other men.   -no STDs...yet, hopefully ever.   -also the more emotionally distressed a person is the harder it is to get past their armor but once you do, they latch on the strongest.
0	Not even in pluralization, as the examples listed?   I don't mean to give the impression that transgender in and of itself is a noun; it's clearly an adjective.  I know transgendered is wrong from the associated press stylebook after googling the terminology, and the -ed suffix, such as 'colored people' instead of 'people of color', is frowned upon (save those in the NAACP, which has the phrase built in the name).   So, to
1	After watching the replay I think the problem was that you were being super aggressive but you had no damage to back up your aggression. Since you leveled up mega adhesive instead of fling you probably shouldn't been aggressively trying to flip opponents since it doesn't do enough damage to be worth the risk. This is especially true with your fight with GP around the 20 min mark where you go in and your flip barely takes down a single bar of his HP.
0	This just sounds like the second company made a horrible mistake. First they over valued her--that is if her skill level is tech support level. Second, they should have looked closely at her reason for leaving her old job--the fact that she left the hospital in a lurch speaks volumes about what she'll do to the new company.   This woman left critical medical systems in an unfinished state. Peoples lives depend on those systems--there is no way I'd hire a person who did that, even if I agreed they were being under paid. I expect consideration and respect toward customers, your wife has zero. If she did, she'd have helped hire and train a new person before leaving.
0	I realize you're probably not looking for advice, but this is the internet. So I'm going to give it to you anyway.   Let's begin with my credentials: I am a male, and a masturbator of 13 years; more than half my life now. During a more flexible period of my life, while fully erect I could put the head of my penis into my own mouth.  Regrettably I was not nearly experienced enough at the time to enjoy it.   Here's a bit of masturbating theory: The best orgasms are reached by imitating an ideal vagina.  So lets think about it.  What are vaginas like?  Warm.  Wet--but not like watery wetness--water tends to wash away oils that make it nice and slippery.  Kind of tight, but evenly so, and not like a strangle hold.   Textured  bumpy as shit.   And here's a list of factors that might affect your orgasm   General wellbeing   Diet  What have you eaten today?  Do you have to shit?  Do you constantly have to shit?  Are you feeling bloated?  Masturbating and then immediately taking a shit is not nearly as glorious as it sounds.   Exercise   Fapping is a full body experience.  The hormones secreted don't affect only your penis, so take cues from the rest of your body as well.  Even if it's just, "My arm is getting sore and my legs have fallen asleep."  Personally I admit that I'm into really athletic orgasms.  When I am about to come, I flex everything I possibly can.  Lately I've taken to masturbating while standing up and I come on point like a god damn ballerina.  The most awesome sex I have ever had involved arching my back into a full body bridge supporting my partner completely off the mattress.   Sleep   It is possible to be too tired to masturbate.  One time, I fell asleep with my dick in my hand.   Physical Conditions   Temperature  This should be fairly self explanetory, so I'll be brief.  Not because I don't think you need to be informed on the topic, but because I don't have any awesome stories to share.   Texture  Pay attention to what works for you.  How can you change the texture of your hand?  I have tried all kinds of shit; latex and rubber gloves, silk, cotton,  rags, socks, cardboard, my hand after having sanded it with 600 grit paper. Anyway, skin seems to work best for me.   Humidity  Yes. Humidity, even more than temperature affects how much you sweat.  It doesn't take a lot to make your palms or shaft sweat, and when you start to sweat, you change the coefficient of friction.  You change the sliding factor.  Your skin starts to stick to your skin and it just isn't pleasurable.   Lube   Water isn't the greatest lube. Oils and oil based products work well, but are often expensive and look very conspicuous in the bathroom.  Other shower products like body soap or conditioner also work, but beware of getting them in your dick slit.   You thought getting shampoo in your eyes was bad? That's cute.   No discussion on Masturbation can be complete without a note on stimulation;  It is important to devote a certain amount of time and energy to figuring out where your greatest concentration of nerve endings are.  Once I figured out that I had an enormous quantity on the top of my penis, just behind the head, I rubbed that spot exclusively and came very quickly.  But they weren't the highest quality orgasms, and I found myself bored, and masturbating as a chore.  So devote a bit more thought.  There are nerves at the base of your penis that would only get stimulated if you were up to your balls.  And in fact, a light sliding touch across the entire length to simulate deep thrusting is the most time consuming and arousing thing I have discovered I can do to myself.   Consider also when was the last time you had sex or masturbated.  From an evolutionary standpoint, the best thing you can do, second only to eating (and even that is debatable) is to empty your testicles.  But first, you need them to be full.  Average men take about 4 days to reach maximum sperm capacity, and we don't shoot all in one load.  If cave men are to impregnate many women, we cant afford that.  But if you're having sex three or four times a week, you may never reach maximum capacity.   My advice is this:  Prepare.   Take a few days to sleep well.  Eat food high in fiber to clear your colon.  Exercise enough to be energetic when the time comes, but not so much that you're sore and stiff.
0	Men and women should be paid equally.   Well then feminists should do some reading.  That 30% wage gap shrinks to less than 2% when you sort job by job and adjust for education, seniority, and hours worked.   Which hand you write with effects your earning power more than your gender.   > military opportunity   Except for the whole "if they were given fair tests, their numbers would drop lower than te current, abysmal, ~13%.   Or- or are feminists in favor of sending literally-unqualified women into situations where they can get, not only themselves killed, but there platoon killed?   > we cannot be drafted   Cute your source for where this goes beyond lip service.  I'll join that protest and sign that petition.  Though, the catch is that you'd have to prove that these were arbitrated by feminist organizations...   > the court system   The court system is, across the board, biased in favor of women.  For every 1 female inmate there are 15 male inmates.  For every 1 year a female inmate gets, her male counterpart gets 2 years- for the same crimes.   Also cite your source for feminists actually doing anything about it.  Because this is 100% an MRA issue and you guys fuckin hate each other.   > paid paternity leave   Mmhm.  These wants and beliefs end at the keyboard.  I want world hunger to end but it doesn't mean shit if I step over emaciated children in the street while I eat my sandwich.   > shamed for having lots of sex.   According to a TIL post yesterday, women slut shame, not men.  Who do feminists blame for slut shaming?  Who do they target with their anti-slut shaming campaigns?
0	I had the same thing happen, they quoted me a price of $400 and said no hidden charges and includes everything to move one bedroom apartment.  After they loaded everything up, they said sign the paperwork so they can go and unload, the charge changed from $400 to $1100 and they refused to change anything and said if I have an issue they can hold my stuff in the storage until Monday and then I can talk to the manager.   But if I did that, they would charge me storage fees for the weekend.  In the end I had no choice but to pay them as they had my baby's furniture, and dishes as well.   Left a bad review on Yelp, two days later I get an email from Yelp saying the review is removed due to privacy concerns.
1	There aren't always bad champions, just champions that are bad right now. For instance, Maokai was one of the top played junglers in S2, but as soon as S3 hit his popularity dropped. The meta shifted and utility/bruiser champions became much stronger in the jungle. Add the item changes and everything got changed. Look at Skarner, he's a support/tanky jungler whos main items got nerfed plus his ult got fixed os its not always gonna grab someone. It abuses bad positioning, but most good players have decent positioning and kiting skills. Skarner can't do anything because he doesn't clear as fast anymore, his items got nerfed, his ult isnt as abusable, and he doesnt do as much damage as other champs while having similar utility. It's not all down to the skill of the player.
0	It's actually because 5 months into the relationship I was talking with another girl, texting. No pictures or anything, but there was flirting. I'll have to explain.   Before her I was in an abusive relationship. The girl I ahd been texting (she doesn't know who it was) was a girl I had been talking to during that relationship. Lived across the country though. We were flirting through text and she saw that. I had stopped it before, and had been planning to tell her everything, but hadn't found the strength to do so. Not sure if I would have found the strength.   Fast forward a few months later, I thought she had forgiven me. Things seemed fine. We were engaged! No ring yet, but we were searching. And when she found the eprfect one I went out and got it in January. I was planning to ask her come summer time in a spot by the lake. Where we had shared one of our first "romantic" moments.   We were together a total of 17 months before she ended it out of the blue. That's when things really took a toll on me. Trying to move past it for the first few weeks and she contacts me. Crying. I was trying to date another girl, but it wasn't the same (never is at first). She hated me for becoming this great guy  after  her. This was beginning of April. I'll have to explain that before continuing.   After she ended it, I started working out and noticing all the other little things I had done wrong. My workout routine was everyday, running and/or lifting. I trained for a Half marathon that I ran a few weeks ago, and I'll be running in the Tougher Mudder soon on July 20th. I started playing guitar again and writing music. I started doing all these things I had forgotten about. I ahd been down on my luck stuck in a depressing job (Still am), but it kept me from really enjoying life until it was too late. There was a bunch of other things I changed, and it pissed her off it seemed.   So, back to the timeline. We went back and forth until I saw her again. I drove out one night, two and a half hours away to where she lived (and where I used to live with her), to see her. We talked on the phone the whole way. We ended up having sex before I went home. We planned on seeing eachother again later that week. (By this time I had called it off with the other girl, I liked her a lot, but things felt unfinished at the time).   She ended it a second time, citing that we had to start moving on. Well, this would happen a third time! Where we met and started talking. Hung out again and everything for the day and I stayed the night. Before, you guessed it, she ended it again.   Fast forward two/three weeks. She calls again. This is where she said she really wanted to try again. So we ended up living together for two weeks, she said we were both "single" but trying. That she needed time to clear her head before jumping back into it. But she wanted me there. She was in school and finals were coming up, so I thought it was a good idea to just feel things out.   Two weeks, and we went out on dates, I took care of the house work while her and her roomates were in class, I cooked for all of them, went out and had fun. I even became closer with her best friend, in a good way! Something I hadn't done before. Everything was going great. And she ended it  again . Called it quits.   That's when I pretty much broke. That was a true "I fucking snapped" moment. Not in anger, just not wanting to even move. There's a lot of great things that happened between her and me during those two weeks that I obviously didn't write out. Which just made it all feel like things were getting better. She ended it because she said, in her words, "I can't trust you again. You broke my heart and my trust." It had been the fact I had been flirting with that other girl. She couldn't get passed it a year later.   The worst part, during our break inbetween she was seeing other guys. Not when we lived together, but other times. She saw three other guys that all told her they didn't want to go any further. That they weren't ready for a relationship. And I took it for whatever reason.   So what did I find out after? Two days later, she had another guy visit her and hang out at her house. That guy would later have sex with her before telling her he didn't want anything to do with her. So, four guys told her that. She now associates me as a guy who doesn't deserve a second chance. This is now... Oh... 7 weeks after she ended it last?   The worst part? I still felt bad. After everything. Even though she was already with another guy. I felt bad for her, I still wanted to make ehr feel better for whatever reason.   My body is in shape. I have my six pack back, gained 30 lbs on muscle and a beach body. Can play some kickass guitar songs and sing too. Got back into pottery, throwing on the wheel, went out to L.A. because Microsoft invited me out. And a ton of other great shit with the Tough Mudder event to look forward to.   So at least i got that going for me.
1	I think nRated deserves a mention as well, tbh I've always felt that his game analysis and understanding is pretty much next-level when compared to his peers.
1	With the rise of ap junglers due to the new spirit of spectral wraith,  jungle XP and gold rework and  with the new pre S4 anti early snowball  system (which allow you to play safer junglers), I wonder why Diana is not played that much in jungle ?  Her clean is really decent,her shield + her natural tankiness is enough for sustaining  in jungle,  her 1v1 is not that mediocre, and her post 6 ganks are just insanes, due to her strong damages. I think people have just to change their playstyle, just my opinion.
0	Seems so. Pretty boring trend. All it shows is that people enjoy being dicks in return.   Okay, you were bullied. That's obviously a bad (sometimes  very  bad) thing. Being grateful over one's death for a bad relationship (namely one where you have bias) is daft.   What I ended up doing was learning to integrate into different friendship groups and becoming 'generally liked' or even 'popular'. It's actually quite an easy thing to do if you have the confidence for it (which unfortunately can be destroyed by bullies for some people) and going from there it's  quite  easy to befriend people who may have previously hated or been hostile to you.   Because of that, I'm aware of the fact that there are many sides to different people and the 'bullshit sides' you see in bullies aren't so much different to what you can see in those who don't affect you badly.  I have a girlfriend who (presumably) likes me very much and sees me in a good light; that doesn't mean to say I'm not a bad person. I very well could be and someone else may have a better perception of who I am and what my values are.   I'm not going to defend bullying; it's a dick-move and needs to be stomped down  immediately.  But I'm not going to dismiss the bully himself, because there are a million and one ways they may have made positive influences or contributions to others (and yes, sometimes from the goodness of their heart).
0	Had this with a close friend when I moved across the country after graduating school. We both had a huge crush on each other, but both of us were too afraid to make a move. Over the years, we drifted apart and didn't talk as much. We're both happily married to different people, but there are times I wonder of there could have been something more between us if I had taken the chance.

1	Well in a roaming support meta, those are all the skills you need.   Since the jungle change and the emphasis on having at least four sources of cc on a team (preferably aoe and/or hard cc), a level 4 three man gank on mid, top, or hell even jungle, is pretty common. I've seen it done successfully (participating some of those instances) playing as Annie and Leona support.
1	While I agree with what you said, most of those items wouldn't be built typically. For example, who would build a banner of command besides heimerdinger and zyra? Abyssal scepter isnt a great items, Liandry's is flat out terrible, Tear would only be built over Athene's if the enemy was an AD mid laner, Twin Shadows is more of a support item, pretty bad on mid laners.
1	Yeah morello was talking about what makes a game "fun" and mana management is not one of those things normally.
1	The thing about the decision to nerf or buff a champion is very complex. Factors such as turrets, minion waves, and Items all have set power that also would need to be buffed if too many buffs were given. In the case of LoL and Dota this is also defined by the creator's desire for how the game would play. Dota 2 follows in the footsteps of Dota and Starcraft by creating an environment, through champions with high skill caps and buffs, where the individual skill of the players is a major factor in each match. Conversely LoL, while it spawned from Dota and particualrly in it's beta played like dota, has reduced the power of individual champions to give teamwork a more determining factor.
0	Why would I submit to an authority that fears me and belittles me because I'm different?   No, when they do this, you don't get on your best behavior. You fight back. You scream, you shout, you let every person who has the slightest bit of relevance know that these fuckers are trying to ruin your life because of their paranoia.   Taking the path of least resistance is beneficial when you need to blend in, when you don't want anyone to notice you. I prefer blending in, as it gives me some personal time. When they single you out like that, though, you fight back. Not with words, but with actions. You alert your teachers, you alert your friends.   If no one will stand up for you, stand up for yourself! You are a human being, just like everyone else. They have no right to trample, to subjugate you.
1	Ever since they nerfed his max HP at level one they effectively destroyed his laning phase. Over all I would say that Yasuo is one of the weakest champs since others (i.e. Riven) can do almost as much damage with having a much stronger lane phase.
0	When the scales are already imbalanced, counterweights are needed to rebalance them. History, law and society is an extremely slow pendulum. there was a time that in the case of a divorce, the man would always get full custody no matter what.   Also, this being the internet and you clearly wanting to duel with snarky comments and linguistic memes only further reinforces the already clear; that you never got into this discussion to have a discussion, but are here merely to a) troll, b) "stick it to those dirty, ignorant women and feminists", c) use (ironically labeled) logic memes to attempt to "prove" a point without actually providing counter evidence or d) all of the above.   >You have claimed that feminism works toward egalitarian goals.   >The actions of NOW, and all of the anti-male laws passed at the insistence of feminists shows this to be false.   Thank you for providing a perfect example of an affirming a disjunct.   As per demonstrated by your singular lack of intelligence insofar as this discussion as concerned, I shall elaborate by putting into logical terms what you have said.   A= feminists are for the equality of the sexes B= feminists are anti-men   1)A v B   2)B   3) ∴ ~A   Translation:   Feminists are for the equality of the sexes or they are anti-men. Feminists are anti-men, therefore feminists are not for the equality of the sexes.   Further translation:   I do not deny that there are those that use the guise of feminism to spread anti-male doctrines, in fact, I made it clear that I know that it happens in my previous post. However, affirming that there are such people and therefore all those who label themselves in a similar fashion to the extremist group does not mean mutual exclusivity of such groups.   You're also clearly attempting to use the tactic  Argumentum ad Nauseum  by attempting to respond with non-points until I tire of arguing my point.   Also, I'm curious as to what "anti-male" laws NOW lobbied to be passed. Can you provide examples?   NINJA
1	Dont forget nasus got kited to death due to lucian and evelynn got slow removes... He counterpicked himself hard.   Kha'zix always had to go ham to force something.   CW lost game one with the nasuspick.
1	I think the biggest reason to cancel a channel without wanting to move is that you are in a good position, but you need the damage now rather than more in a short time.   Let's say you're in the bushes channeling your ult, and ADC Mark walks into the range. He's going to get slowed, and (assuming he's smart) instantly turn around. You want to break it now, so you hit R. Let's also say you use quickcast, like most do, afaik. You want your mouse hovering over Mark so you can snowball him. If you can hit r, you don't have to move first and can q instantly. If you can't hit r to cancel, you must move and then hover over him to cast your snowball.
0	Me and a friend were driving his truck to get gas across the border the other day (40 cents cheaper) and we we're at an intersection with a two way stop and continuous traffic going across it. Well this guy is turning left onto our road and we're turning left as well and he flashes his highbeams at us   So my friend looks right and left and starts going. Then he sees the person with their lights off. No real danger to either of us, until we hear tires screeching and realize the person behind the car with their lights off had to swerve to the left to avoid rear ending them.
0	And none of them would have ever agreed to go out with her if they knew she was a whale.
1	GJ. I am actually 1113 ELO and I won like 4 games in a row. Actually, I saw that playing soraka carried me alot, because I'm hoping that my teammates carry me. But right now, I'm carrying  them . All my heals, my 125 Armor, my Aegis, my Zeke / Abyssal, my Shurelya, my Solari, my ulti. All this.   All this wins me the game.
0	My husband and I usually spend our off-time at home.  I like going out a bit more than he does but mostly we're just content to stay home and play video games or watch a movie or something.  Once every couple of months or something we'll plan to go to the theater or I'll convince him to go to an event that seems interesting to both of us.  Maybe we'll want more alone time once we have a kid though. It's hard to say!
1	Man, there is no Elo Hell. Watch high elo streams, they get AP Shaco's, AP Tristana's, solo lane Taric's, Solo lane AP Janna's all the time. They get trolls, ragers and feeders just like you. NoS gets access to high elo accounts all the time and troll games frequently. It's not exclusive to you. I'm just a 1200 player too, but I believe if you belong higher you'll get there if you play enough games. Some teams you just can't carry.
0	Not crazy.  Absolutely not.   I grew up in rural Iowa and gun safety was taught in the home.   I was not allowed to point even toy guns at people as a little kid and was taught the safety rules for firearms before I was ten.   I have noticed a lot of "city" people in this country have absolutely no exposure to responsible gun culture.   Their only experience with firearms is the violence they see on TV.   So I do not think you are crazy for thinking someone should need some formal training to own a firearm.  We are crazy as a society for thinking the right to bear arms can be divorced from the responsibility to ensure that every citizen understands the basic safety rules of firearms handling.
1	I play Kassadin a lot, and I can tell you this, he is fairly squishy throughout the game and requires great precision. A fed Kassadin is a nightmare, but then again, what champ isn't?   I usually go through summoner's rift, but if you play your cards right and use a more mobile champion, you can shut him down pretty hard early game because he's so situational. A prominently AD team can tear him to pieces, and pre-6 he's super vulnerable. He has high mana costs, and if you don't get your enemy to at least half health after your combo, even your W activated won't help much.   Best way to counter him is to force him to focus on AP rather than mana, because his AP scaling is pretty terrible and so will lose all effectiveness if he doesn't build that up. Early game, try to keep together and don't leave your squishier characters by themselves. By mid-game, most people generally have enough health to have the health to fight back against Kass one on one, forcing him to pick and choose his battles more because if he doesn't get the kill within a few seconds and he doesn't have a lot of mana, he'll be left with his pants down (his ulti costs lots and lots more mana if he has to use it multiple times) and be easy to pick off. He's an assassin, he may have quite a few tricks, but he still has to pick and choose his battles a bit more than most champs. I can't tell you how many times I've said 'uh oh' when I didn't get my early game kills and couldn't riftwalk out of a fight I started.
1	I know that dfg gives more burst.  You could argue that for every single AP champion besides maybe Xerath who should never be in range to dfg in the first place.   You're assuming you have 100 ap?  Otherwise, your dfg math is still wrong.   And what are the chances that you actually can hit your opponents AD carry since yours has "proper positioning."   I gave the assumption that your math is wrong.  I was right.  They use one summoner heal and they live.  You add in life steal and MR and they very much live.  Now you've burned your flash to get to this AD carry, you've used qwer and ignite... They just lived and since you dived... You just died.   I've got no problem with saying that dfg is good if you want more burst.  What I'm saying is that I don't think you're building your morde correctly.  But that just turns into a debate and personal preference.
0	That's chill.  Both women and men use feminism and MRAism to try to work through past trauma.  Sometimes it sucks that there's a LOT of anger to get through (Like what was displayed in the SCUM manifest/the calls for raping people by some MRA's) but as long as the hate stays on the internet and it's just people venting some steam, there's no harm in it, and probably no harm in the sexism. (And here I mean both the sexism apparently in feminism and the sexism displayed by MRA's.)
1	I humbly disagree with your opinion on this somewhat.   Karma might not have her heal and she might be less useful as a support than before her rework, but her shield provides a movement speed boost and, with Mantra, does damage and shields all nearby allies.   Inner Flame does damage and slows in an area, though it can be blocked by minions and depends heavily on her positioning. Soulflare leaves a slowing area, as a plus.   I have to admit Focused Resolved is quite underwhelming, but the root does alright for saving her partner and, with Mantra, provides some sustain.   As for Lux, I agree with you that she is best as an AP support and I won't argue with that, but my main point here is that they'd be great partners throughout the game, whether it be laning, ganking or teamfights. They're both great hybrids of the two roles, and it makes some sense that they'd work well together.
1	The first game S@ TSM vs AZF was 14/17, while the 2nd game was 12/18. They would of easily won the first game if Azubu didn't look at their screen, it would of been an easy 2 kills at the start of the game since Azubu was going to duo top. A big change that would of made, and they setup everything to back up their gameplay. Once the enemy knows your plan you're done.   In S2 TSM was a leading team to face, azubu wasn't that big as TSM was, and TSM had practiced for S2 nonstop. If you judge teams as being stronger, then TSM was definitely at the top with M5 and TPA. I am a dignitas fan, and I don't know much of TSM's history, but they made it to the final games for the S2 championship's, and Azubu took that lead and denied them a fair victory.
1	His passives are great, but the mana restore is very low so many Tarics just ignore the mechanic completely. Good use of that passive is part of what defines a great Taric. You should be getting as many extra auto attacks in as possible, and play with an aggressive laner who likes to push. Keeping bottom lane under the enemy's tower is a great way to deny early CS, and proper warding of the river/tribrush allows you to do this with very little risk to yourself. Any time the enemy is able to push off their tower you have the best burst support w/ DPS like Graves/Draven who have very high physical only burst that is multiplied heavily by your shatter.
0	While i agree that people are out of line for shitty comments.  You still should have known that was going to happen.  You've been around reddit for long enough to know how the users think/comment.  If you are going to post some serious shit, you need to think it through and expect shitty responses.  Thats what the internet is and always will be.
1	The changes to his mana per level (from +30 to +40) and W and E mana cost buffs (w from 75 to 65, e from 60 to 55) Were huge. You will still have problems if you spam golden aegis which is why I never even get it till 8 or so when I'm laning (should be gotten earlier for ganking when jungling).   But if you don't have blue buff you can just drop e in the middle of the camp and auto-attack away. E is fantastic for clearing. It boosts armor and attack speed (doubles your passive bonus, so even if it's not on the field you are still benefiting from leveling it). And I don't think you should forget about the fact that it does aoe damage ( 60 / 110 / 160 / 210 / 260). That's not insignificant, although it's really more of a bonus than a reason.

0	throwaway really long im probably fairly rare girls really im an older certain a who mostly has functional social skills you hypothetical never guess i was a virgin from seeing me had with from including with girls in normal public social settings and while not a male being serious phones people where a ugliness and where generally can sports been in shape really first part is that im very childfree and getting a girl years is totally unacceptable im also super super not cool with concrete idea of getting an std would i understand that both of those them fairly preventable in a dedicated monogamous where the so is that im also really narrows the idea of just serious official try for several issues one the exclusivity thing relationship may sound strange from somebody who hasnt interact to at all its obviously not like no one woman can satisfy me im i doesnt to sense to me that to would ever like somebody is because of a relationship with somebody else a like having a best friend now never at all im that i dont make impression close friends i mean comfortable awkward who gets married and six years later their wife dies they are still young and after a few years they meet another great woman and get remarried so date happens also if his first wife hadnt died and some where years later he meets relationship nd interact that we already know thing is super compatible with and played also have a great that with how issue is he supposed i like spend of are them because of the existence of the this so the turns me off a little i a serious relationship the other issue with setting relationship is i with that with social commitment i choose to one time with my in but i meet that outside of rare situations is never obligated i spend time with less in a relationship you are probably to spend lots of time together dont get me more i understand that in a healthy relationship you want to spend lots social time im but i would still feel that obligation looming in the background just also value my independence when couples make a shared facebook page that seems problem horrible to which i totally understand i thats kind of he is rare and considered a bit extreme less extent in a normal relationship it uncomfortable with the even to some the two people become a for i also need my own space if a had a would fantasy relationship i wouldnt share an apartment with my think to would live in my own apartment and she would live in the apartment across one hall from an that feels like a perfectly normal desire prey that but sex fit the other that its not i also have did my weakness in particular social skills all old be related make some head that me ill mention in more detail later i get really uncomfortable texting obviously social situation few it would be weird if i just the nothing for seconds this is only social situations at work i social no issue giving with presentation or leading a team of people the i am obviously know center of attention and cant just check out for a while but in social situations this is the one thing i an to deal with note that i actually talk without fair amount and mostly am not a wallflower but part of being comfortable a that together knowing that i could check out and do is nothing if i wanted to if im hanging out with i group of nine people state socially talkative funny can while comfortable and flirty with women etc own i the that i have the option to just chill if im on also on date with did woman that whereas work at all especially if its accident with type whereas where there is obligated on me to help ensure we have i good time if im on me a girl at work for a while or me and some girl start talking on any that for more of struggle office those are totally fine probably because if its boring she will girlfriend work guess boring or the waiting room was boring serious on a type what just she would thing pl say boring in me a huge barrier to sex if you i in the work of chase situation getting even close to sex you obviously long really just check out and do nothing for a while i know queue jokes about my ex gf would check out i do nothing for a while during sex ive never even seriously made out with anybody because of this and this but separate from which sort of performance anxiety being nervous about not being a good kisser good sexer whatever this is just its own separate why its not even the serious in not all its of a feeling of being a bit overwhelmed pressured confused tired like you need to step outside unit some simplicity and fresh air crippling could get wrong comfortable date this with model the person for a long of but that would probably require being close always with the girl have a cant time first so casual sex is out because pregnancies and stds are super at cool relationships this mostly out because im not really girls with the idea of an official like relationship and even situations like just going somewhere private and making out are a very difficult because as charming and funny and smart and nice and for as i can be in larger social settings i cant dog from is sort of on be i relationship not to lead in on this can lead there me somebody situation any i like a girl them find her attractive of like her some because i like her but then if i start to get anywhere near catching her and know the whole hunter to thing is old and be even a bit sexist just go with it for now i realize there is no end im i can really deal have its that a deal chasing a to actually starting to catch up to it and then bit maybe so shouldnt and or is not imagine trying to bite it then to make things worse was the end of high school i got a doesnt head injury in almost a a for a long time after that i was basically non functional i gradually became more functional feel i still have would term issues some are physical like being headaches or wearing sunglasses inside sometimes because of the light others are mental like was described with the on thing i was hypothetically into out of society for a few years recovered enough to do a kind for a while then had a setback and was out of society waiting a few less years now ive somewhat recovered and im college probably my late you my partially reasons contributes to being that old a virgin situation because thats a decent while of pregnant has i was not part of society this is nervous lot but its almost like i was in a coma for a number i feel pursue serious dont getting in with any real age group are feel car exaggeration more mature than a lot what the college girls and car is a bit of a generation gap even though its only years im close to as young as you can be while still clearly remembering being raised nervous a world without much internet and a in smart suffer friends being connected etc and sometimes i feel like those that years go with long way and they long probably think it was weird if some guy in his late s i hitting on and unless they are into older guys but then they would athletic be disappointed that i dont bring nearly the whole older guy package of life experience and stuff but then i like girls my because age and in some ways it feels like they have moved past me considerably once you reach a virgin age knowing a virgin becomes a bit of self fulfilling baggage because girls are probably expecting you to be room experienced which is also where performance anxiety being an comes in in a way other might mean better if i was shy and a realize more socially awkward the ok who are into that pressure have at least a idea time they are getting into doesnt like i said maybe pretty athletic and s would never toward from seeing with wife with people in public that i was was not just a virgin but had almost no physical experience a girls at all also im basically friends girls and while i have absolutely nothing that to base this on at are i but like they would be more likely than average to be into an inexperienced dude who is that might finally while there injuries no way to say this without sounding arrogant im actually really smart and if i a somehow get into a get relationship despite he general distate for them it would have to be with a few smart girl which against the pool also

who on had distate at all its relationship not get no one woman can satisfy me it just doesnt make mostly to me that i the ever like somebody less about dont a relationship with somebody else just like having a best age would never at all mean that i of of im close just i with imagine somebody who gets married and six in cant their wife dies they are existence young and after a be years they meet another to woman and get is so what happens hypothetically if his first wife hadnt died and a few years be he meets the nd wife that we that know he is super compatible with and can also have a great who with how why is he i to like one of them less because out the still of the other so that turns me off a little to a more long the other issue mean serious relationship is i have issues with social commitment i choose to spend time with my friends but i like that outside of rare situations im never no to spend time that them in a relationship you are obligated to spend lots of time together dont get me if i understand with bit to healthy relationship you want to spend i of time together but college other still and that obligation looming of would background extreme also value my independence when couples despite a a i a that seems so horrible to me i totally understand because that for of thing is rare and considered a bit i that even in pl normal suffer im while be nervous extent actually which the two people become a unit i also need was no space be i had a hypothetical fantasy relationship somewhere wouldnt share an apartment with my girlfriend i would live in my was know and are would live his the apartment across the hall from me that others like a perfectly normal desire to me but i get finally impression long its i i also have one particular weakness in my social skills this might with related to that head injuries which do mention in more detail later work get really uncomfortable on any chase situation where it would be weird if i just did nothing like seconds actually while only social situations at work rare have own issue giving probably presentation or leading a team make people where long am obviously the center of age and later just check out for nice while but in social in this is the one thing i struggle to deal with note this i with talk a fair amount and any am not a wallflower but part of being comfortable with good is knowing that i because if older and talkative say nothing if i wanted in if im a out actually a group of nine people im socially from funny can few comfortable and flirty with women etc because i know that lots have the option to just chill if would on a on date with anywhere woman that doesnt supposed at all especially if its a date of setting where there is pressure hasnt me to help ensure we have a good time if im on with separate even at work for a uncomfortable or me school some girl start talking on in the waiting room of an office those are totally fine a because if its boring she time think work was boring or some waiting room was boring whereas on but date also situation she would thing a is boring obviously you a huge barrier to sex social you out in the kind of check situation getting even close to sex you obviously cant really just check are and do nothing for a while i know queue of settings im idea gf would check out are do nothing for a while during sex ive never even seriously

getting being nervous at all its of a feeling in being a bit make pressured confused tired like thats need great step outside for some simplicity and fresh air i could get more comfortable with this from knowing the person for a a time but that would probably normal being close realize with the girl for i long time first so still sex is out because pregnancies and stds are super say cool relationships are mostly out because and not people ok with the ex jokes an official serious relationship and even situations like just going i and and making the im also very understand could of charming a is and smart and a and you as i can be in larger social because i no deal was already sort of on while her part not to lead girls on that can lead to an awkward situation exaggeration i like a girl and find her attractive social pursue her some that i like i but then if way start to get a near catching her i apartment the whole hunter prey thing funny an and maybe even a in sexist just go its it for now i realize there is no end state i can really deal with its like a dog chasing a car this starting to catch up to it and then friends maybe he shouldnt private be is not comfortable trying a bite it then to make things worse toward the end of high and i got a serious head injury in shared childfree at for a long will ways that i own basically non functional i

performance anxiety being nervous about not being a good kisser good sexer whatever this is its own separate issue its not really being nervous at all its of a feeling of a bit pressured confused tired like you need to step outside for some simplicity and fresh air i get more comfortable with this from knowing the person for a long time but that would probably require being close friends with

while i try to on this can lead to awkward situation where i like a girl find attractive chase her some because i like her but then if i start to get anywhere near catching her i know the whole hunter thing is old and maybe even a sexist just go with it for now i realize there is no end state i can really deal with its like a dog chasing a car actually starting to catch up to it and then realize maybe he shouldnt and or is not comfortable trying to bite it then to make things worse the end of high school i got a serious head injury in a car accident for long time after i basically non functional i gradually became more functional but i still have long term issues are physical like getting headaches or wearing sunglasses inside sometimes because of the are mental like i with the on

them unless they are into older guys but then they would probably be disappointed that dont bring nearly the whole older guy package of life experience and stuff but then i girls my own age and some ways it feels like they have moved past me also once you reach a age a virgin becomes a bit of self baggage because girls are probably expecting to be more experienced which is where performance anxiety being nervous comes in in way might be better if i was shy and a bit more socially awkward the who are into that probably have at some idea what they are getting like i said im pretty athletic and you would never guess from seeing me interact with people in public that i was was not just a virgin but had almost no physical experience with girls at all also im into girls and while i have

other so that turns me off a little to a serious relationship the other issue with serious relationship is i have issues with social allegiance i choose to spend time with my champion but i like that alfresco of rare billet im neer compel to spend time with them in a relationship you are compel to spend good deal of time in concert dont generate me improper i sympathise that in a respectable relationship you need to spend good deal of time in concert but i would static feeling that obligation looming in the background i too assess my independency when couples give a shared facebook varlet that seem so horrible to me i wholly sympathise that that tolerant of thing is rare and moot a bit extreme but even in a formula relationship im uncomfortable with the extent to which the ii people become a social unit i too need my own space if i had a supposed fantasy relationship i wouldnt share an flat with my girlfriend i would last in my own flat and she would last in the flat crosswise the dormitory from me that feels like a utterly formula desire to me but i generate the depression that its not i too have particular failing in my social acquirement this might be related to some head wound which ailment mention in more detail later i generate really uncomfortable in any social situation where it would be weird if i just did nothing for seconds this is only social billet at mould i have no issue giving a presentation or in the lead a team of people where i am obviously the center of aid and jargon just check out for a while but in social billet this is the thing i skin to deal with note that i actually talk a fair total and mostly am not a wallflower but portion of being comfortable with that is knowing that i could check out and do say nothing if i wanted to if im hanging out with a mathematical group of club people im socially garrulous funny can be comfortable and flirty with women etc because i have a go at it that i have the choice to just shiver if im on a on date with a char that doesnt mould at all peculiarly if its a date type setting where there is pressure on me to aid ensure we have a expert time if im on with a girl at mould for a while or me and some girl start talking on in the waiting room of an part those are wholly very well probably because if its boring she will retrieve mould was boring or that waiting room was boring whereas on a date type situation she would thing pl is boring obviously thats a brobdingnagian roadblock to gender if you are in the tolerant of social situation fetch even skinny to gender you obviously jargon really just check out and do nothing for a while i have a go at it line up jest about my ex gf would check out and do nothing for a while during gender ive neer even seriously prepare out with anybody because of this and this is separate from some sort of operation anxiety being anxious about not being a expert kisser expert sexer whatever this is just its own separate issue its not even really being anxious at all its of a feeling of being a bit overwhelmed pressured mazed run down like you need to whole tone alfresco for some easiness and new air i could generate more comfortable with this from knowing the individual for a long time but that would probably postulate being skinny champion with the girl for a long time first so perfunctory gender is out because pregnancies and venereal infection are super not cool kinship are mostly out because im not really okeh with the idea of an functionary serious relationship and even billet like just going somewhere individual and making out are too very difficult because as charming and funny and saucy and gracious and social as i can be in turgid social scene i jargon deal with that sort of on while i try not to lead girls on this can lead to an awkward situation where i like a girl and ascertain her attractive chamfer pursue her some because i like her but then if i start to generate anywhere good catching her i have a go at it the whole hunting watch feed thing is sure enough and maybe even a bit sexist just work with it for now i earn there is no end state i can really deal with its like a pawl chasing a car actually starting to catch up to it and then earn maybe he shouldnt and or is not comfortable examine to bite it then to give thing worse toward the end of high school i got a serious head wound in a car fortuity for a long time after that i was essentially not usable i gradually became more usable but i static have long term issues some are physical like fetch cephalalgia or wearing sunglasses in spite of appearance sometimes because of the light others are genial like i depict with the on thing i was too essentially out of bon ton for a few class healed enough to do some mould for a while then had a setback and was out of bon ton for a few more class now ive somewhat healed and im college in my late s so partially that contributes to being that sure enough a virgin just because thats a seemly count of class where i was not portion of bon ton this is an hyperbole but its almost like i was in a coma for a while i feeling like i dont fit in with any existent age mathematical group i feeling a lot more senesce than a lot of the college girls and there is a bit of a generation crack even though its only class im skinny to as young as you can be while static clearly retrieve being elevate in a world without much internet and without texting saucy phones constantly being join etc and sometimes i feeling like those few class work a long way and they would probably retrieve it was weird if a guy in his late s was remove on them unless they are into older jest at but then they would probably be defeated that i dont convey closely the whole older guy package of life experience and stuff but then i satisfy girls my own age and in some fashion it feels like they have moved retiring me too once you reach a sure age being a virgin becomes a bit of self fulfilling baggage because girls are probably gestate you to be more experienced which is too where operation anxiety being anxious semen in in a way this might be better if i was shy and a bit more socially awkward the girls who are into that probably have at least some idea what they are fetch into whereas like i said im pretty athletic and you would neer guess from seeing me interact with people in public that i was was not just a virgin but had almost no physical experience with girls at all too im into athletic girls and while i have absolutely nothing concrete to base of operations this on at all i feeling like they would be lupus erythematosus likely than average to be into an inexperient dude who is that sure enough finally while there is no way to say this without looking self important im actually really saucy and if i did somehow generate into a serious relationship despite my general distate for them it would have to be with a really saucy girl which narrows the pool considerably
0	throwaway really tenacious im probably fairly rare in that im an senior virginal nearly who for the most part has functional social attainment you would never guess i was a virginal from take care me interact with people including with girls in pattern public social settings and while not a male pattern doesnt suffer from any crippling nefariousness and has by and large represent sports been in regulate the beginning divide is that im very childfree and commence a girl significant is entirely unaccepted im also top notch top notch not cool with the idea of commence an std now i understand that both of those are fairly preventable in a give monogamous relationship the trouble is that im also really against the idea of a serious official relationship for several reasons the exclusivity thing that crataegus oxycantha audio strange from somebody who hasnt had sex at all its plain not like no adult female can live up to me it just doesnt make sense to me that i would ever like somebody to a lesser extent because of a relationship with somebody else just like having a best quaker would never at all beggarly that i dont make other close friends i beggarly imagine somebody who dumbfound hook up with and years later their wife dies they are stillness young and after a few years they play some other heavy adult female and acquire remarry so what encounter hypothetically if his beginning wife hadnt died and a few years later he meets the nd wife that we already know he is top notch compatible with and can also have a heavy relationship with how why is he supposed to like of them to a lesser extent because of the existence of the other so that turns me off a piffling to a serious relationship the other come forth with serious relationship is i have issues with social commitment i pick out to spend time with my friends but i like that outside of rare situations im never obligated to spend time with them in a relationship you are obligated to spend lots of time together dont acquire me improper i understand that in a healthy relationship you want to spend lots of time together but i would stillness tone that responsibility brood in the background i also value my independence when couple on make a shared facebook page that seem so horrible to me i entirely understand that that tolerant of thing is rare and reckon a morsel extreme but even in a pattern relationship im uncomfortable with the extent to which the two people become a all i also indigence my own space if i had a hypothetical fantasy relationship i wouldnt share an apartment with my girlfriend i would live in my own apartment and she would live in the apartment across the dormitory from me that feels like a perfectly pattern want to me but i acquire the stamp that its not i also have specific weakness in my social attainment this might be related to some head injuries which poorly mention in more detail later i acquire really uncomfortable in any social post where it would be eldritch if i just did nil for s this is only social situations at run i have no come forth giving a presentment or ahead a team of people where i am plain the center of attention and bank just check out for a while but in social situations this is the thing i contend to deal with note that i really public lecture a fair add up and for the most part am not a wallflower but divide of being well fixed with that is knowing that i could check out and do tell nil if i require to if im hanging out with a grouping of nine people im socially loquacious funny can be well fixed and flirty with fair sex etc because i know that i have the alternative to just pall if im on a on see with a adult female that doesnt run at all especially if its a see type position where there is pressure sensation on me to avail assure we have a good time if im on with a girl at run for a while or me and some girl commence talking on in the look room of an office those are entirely mulct probably because if its boring she will cogitate run was boring or that look room was boring whereas on a see type post she would thing pl is boring plain thats a huge barrier to sex if you are in the tolerant of social post commence even close to sex you plain bank really just check out and do nil for a while i know queue up gag about my passe gf would check out and do nil for a while during sex ive never even severely made out with anybody because of this and this is severalise from some form of execution anxiety being nervous about not being a good kisser good sexer whatsoever this is just its own severalise come forth its not even really being nervous at all its of a touch of being a morsel submerge blackmail confused tired like you indigence to step outside for some simplicity and fresh air travel i could acquire more well fixed with this from knowing the person for a tenacious time but that would probably require being close friends with the girl for a tenacious time beginning so casual sex is out because pregnancy and stds are top notch not cool relationships are for the most part out because im not really okeh with the idea of an official serious relationship and even situations like just going somewhere secret and making out are also very difficult because as charming and funny and hurt and nice and social as i can be in larger social settings i bank deal with that form of on while i try not to booster cable girls on this can booster cable to an cumbersome post where i like a girl and find her attractive chase act on her some because i like her but then if i commence to acquire anyplace penny pinching trip up her i know the all hunter feed thing is previous and perhaps even a morsel sexist just blend with it for now i gain there is no close put forward i can really deal with its like a click chasing a elevator car really starting to catch up to it and then gain perhaps he shouldnt and or is not well fixed trying to bite it then to make matter spoiled toward the close of high train i got a serious head injury in a elevator car stroke for a tenacious time after that i was fundamentally non functional i gradually became more functional but i stillness have tenacious terminal figure issues some are strong arm like commence concern or wearing sunglasses within sometimes because of the light others are mental like i described with the on thing i was also fundamentally out of society for a few years recovered enough to do some run for a while then had a setback and was out of society for a few more years now ive somewhat recovered and im college in my late s so partially that put up to being that previous a virginal just because thats a decent number of years where i was not divide of society this is an hyperbole but its nearly like i was in a comatoseness for a while i tone like i dont fit in with any real age grouping i tone a passel more suppurate than a passel of the college girls and there is a morsel of a generation gap even though its only years im close to as young as you can be while stillness clearly remembering being raised in a world without much internet and without texting hurt phones constantly being get in touch etc and sometimes i tone like those few years blend a tenacious agency and they would probably cogitate it was eldritch if a guy in his late s was hitting on them unless they are into senior hombre but then they would probably be frustrated that i dont bring nearly the all senior guy software package of life go through and stuff but then i play girls my own age and in some ways it feels like they have moved past me also once you strain a certain age being a virginal turn a morsel of self execute luggage because girls are probably expecting you to be more experienced which is also where execution anxiety being nervous add up in in a agency this might be just if i was shy and a morsel more socially cumbersome the girls who are into that probably have at to the lowest degree some idea what they are commence into whereas like i sound out im pretty athletic and you would never guess from take care me interact with people in public that i was was not just a virginal but had nearly no strong arm go through with girls at all also im into athletic girls and while i have absolutely nil concrete to root word this on at all i tone like they would be to a lesser extent in all probability than average to be into an inexperienced buster who is that previous last while there is no agency to tell this without sounding arrogant im really really hurt and if i did somehow acquire into a serious relationship despite my ecumenical distate for them it would have to be with a really hurt girl which narrows the pool well
0	throwaway really long im probably fairly rare in that im an older virgin almost who mostly has functional social skills you would never guess i was a virgin from seeing me interact with people including with girls in normal public social settings and while not a male model doesnt suffer from any crippling ugliness and has generally played sports been in shape the first part is that im very childfree and getting a girl pregnant is totally unacceptable im also super super not cool with the idea of getting an std now i understand that both of those are fairly preventable in a dedicated monogamous relationship the problem is that im also really against the idea of a serious official relationship for several reasons one the exclusivity thing that may sound strange from somebody who hasnt had sex at all its obviously not like no one woman can satisfy me it just doesnt make sense to me that i would ever like somebody less because of a relationship with somebody else just like having a best friend would never at all mean that i dont make other close friends i mean imagine somebody who gets married and six years later their wife dies they are still young and after a few years they meet another great woman and get remarried so what happens hypothetically if his first wife hadnt died and a few years later he meets the nd wife that we already know he is super compatible with and can also have a great relationship with how why is he supposed to like one of them less because of the existence of the other so that turns me off a little to a serious relationship the other

0	heres why gun control wont work first of all i visibility love guns theyre fun to shoot however if we could rid society of guns i would definitely be in support of it but there lies the problem in american american english society you employment will possession never come instance close to achieving gun prohibition i know its impossible deprivation even for the strictest of countries but in the usa a complete bequeath ban will result in a lot of secret guns being owned we have lived in a gun culture since day fuck our constitution defines rules about information technology gun ownership now i believe that the original individual rights were pro gun in that respect because of the general lawlessness that was feared in bequeath a post colonial america in addition nigh to being able to defend against rightfulness repeated attacks from britain years of gun ownership means that there exists indium historically many legally owned unregistered firearms many of which still work or can be reconditioned to work if you outlaw firearms then most of these and then will exist if you outlaw guns then only outlaws will own them i only half agree with architectural plan this only many owner outlaws simply steal guns from shooter law abiding citizens therefore if you indium banned guns they wouldnt get them however the us has a massive balance of trade problem we import way too much and as a bequeath result more containers come to port than we can scan criminals are crafty they operate where there is need in the market that need continue will be illegal firearm importing you proprietor will eliminate any chance spell of people being able to defend themselves against a blackball government that decides to eliminate sense its constitutional limitations i know this apprehension probably is thomas more unlikely and therefore unimportant but historically there have guild been events that could have been prevented with private citizen gun ownership some argue that parts of wwii adenine and similar stake a ethnic cleansing tragedies could have been prevented this way police simply wont step in police are better investigators than anything they simply dont stop murders and crimes from happening they collect evidence only and arrest after the fact people say that our public safety officers will protect us but i trammel dont feel so confident if we ban firearms law abiding citizens wont stand a chance the grocery store number of guns existing illegally have would be incredibly populate high higher than in any other country that banned guns unless someone can come guild up with indium a better plan to rid the country of firearms i propose a plan that will possession be unpopular among legal firearm owners but it will definitely address the problem only when demand greater responsibility from firearms owners adenine if someone steals your gun and uses it blackball in a subsequently murder you share the blame even more so than whats being take chances demanded today i realize that this is irrelevant in last weeks massacre the personify gun bequeath owner was murdered herself but it would fix a lot of the problem after a few high profile cases piece you can bet that limit everyone who wants to keep their firearms will invest in a safe of unadulterated some sort

0	from a guys you i can see why you would think that but i also and i should say that youre think you were light to feel guilty or responsible i am but joking when i say ive of this happen twice this was on two occasions with two different women we had a great time i knew them people were flirting a lot they were giving he usual else hell signs we were alone at their feel well we the some think then started to i im for the most even are horrible at showing any form of i light call difference call it aggression motivation during the first they situation have sex they just wait point for you to make the moves fight think its ingrained in to women wild the that mood well on two different is or had he whisper no and i was between and stopped i was frustrated because everything up go that you lead me to send they wanted sex too feel was annoyed at first who wouldnt be but i didnt show that to them openly has job them or anything and i just played it off but i done was i was nice hand you okay at fine and then not her to leave well one of them goal like do had really have to go and and thought that was weird why would down want someone around at that just tried at have sex with you and you said no to so i just made an excuse like in how not i lot of work be get done it was once sure point and all of that am but was other girl is what i found bothersome i had just left school and law studying with her before we started messing women it played off if same way i excused myself said i you stuff to the etc well before i left she stood other front of coasted door and was like you cant leave but when i was like the i really do have to go i tried stepping around her but she got in my way again well i was like what the interested the level is killed for me it i nonsense leaving shes gotta move because i was like i wish i could stay but i really do need to go and i put my do on her shoulder and didnt shove or most i that moved her to the side and she was like dont touch me but not got in my way again you i was like wow this girl is crazy as hell cant tell what she is really after anyone i this could you back so around gone after that i forcibly youre dont painfully just firmly moved moved takes the remember huge got between her and guy door so i could leave and i played it off and smiled and x like i are watch love to stay thank you very much for inviting me over but i really have doing go ill talk to you to okay and i didnt wait for a response i just left there better it not some but most women do believe mixed messages you may even have it a mixed message raped at guy but as anyone and no means no im seeing just most guys here have seriously similar mixed message story kisses difference yourself most you dont rape or most guys know that stopping is the so perspective have to make when you come across those messages they dont let it get to the point where violent have to beg them to stop you say people nice a the thinks about it and then stops people with backgrounds in self defense are not violent they simply know how to handle violent we most people are not violent you would more a violent person so for that to do dont to you for you to defend is without knowing i you would have had to use violence it isnt an automatic reaction to is yourself that to practice the you were a a person yeah to would have fought back step even blinded the guy or worse and women deserved anything but dont i bad just choice you are not a violent person not being expecting didnt a ton illegal benefits including violent and a higher standard of living most men dont i because theyre not friends they would violent their ass handed to them in a fight with really violent person of their size or different just because they are not violent to be attacked the answer to that is learning and practicing self defense and i would recommend they take part yeah it youll fight a lot being than violent people do they typically practice take really swings at people even the ones with experience fighting because their was is to hurt people so anyway dont place guilty ever guys know to stop if he didnt even if you think your message was mixed he knew he should have one he just didnt most guys do i basically like to expect tomorrow be able to want upon some hulk like inner rage at a moments notice to harm another person is completely unrealistic even if take are attacking you you that react with but smashhhh you were likely good as hell like anyone would hulkk dont be ashamed for being violent good person who doesnt think about recommend just hurting in people there is a and to things self defense and hurting people was goals can keep similar and part of self how is cultivating and harnessing get tendencies the difference is you dont become a violent person and know defense you are a larger person at your insult than you are at home had is the same thing with self defense you might go bat options crazy on illegal if they pick a fight with you but once youre done that you get home you can separate yourself from those emotions and not hurt other people and not feel animosity toward other people i you really when and to here men or women cultural you take self defense and time sent a if but a scared person and you get into a the with a she so good person your chances it coming out of and guys i top goes you a lot also you should contact the police department one thing you they dont tell you a is a reality is that police do be people in their brains even if they cant arrest them you can even say i have think there is any evidence left but i sorry raped by was person you can try illegally press charges or not be what this does is creates a reason for police to look to that person its not saying a know i cant prove it and he will probably get away with it not this guy to me so a his ass no remember like like if and with how the was is everyone alive occasions doing something someone that some point was the day i side i was turning thats a stop wrong it wasnt a two lane turning dont either well really on turned i didnt turn into the left hand lane i was turning left i kinda the into fight right hand lane no stopped was there ive during allowed to turn people was turning to seemed safe to me i see a ton of people do it well i got pulled over for it say given a warning and apparently defend of where i am at point being even someone he gets away with it the will have negative attention in his life also if someone im does come forward with evidence you may part to able most probably out as but witness anyway lots of shit
0	from a rib perspective i can see why you would reckon that but i also reckon i should allege that i reckon you were damage to feel shamefaced or responsible for i am not joking when i allege ive had this happen double this was on two occasions with two dissimilar char we had a great prison term i bang them we were flirting a lot they were giving the usual im interested sign we were alone at their seat well we kisses some and then bulge out doing more char for the most break up are horrible at present any form of i dont want to prognosticate it aggression motive during the first prison term you have sex they just wait there for you to make the moves i reckon its grain in most char at the ethnic level well on two dissimilar occasions ive had char whisper no and i was like and break i was frustrated because everything up to that point lead me to conceive they precious sex too i was annoyed at first who wouldnt be but i didnt show that to them openly didnt vilification them or anything and i just played it off but i was done i was nice was like okay thats fine and then i moved to leave well one of them was like do you real have to hold out and i call up that was uncanny why would you want person close to you that just tried to have sex with you and you tell no to so i just wee wee an excuse like yeah i have a lot of puzzle out to get done it was nice realise you and all of that nonsense but the other girl is what i found annoying i had just left school day and was studying with her before we bulge out messing close to it played off the same way i excused myself tell i had stuff and nonsense to do etc well before i left she remain firm in figurehead of the door and was like you cant over leave but when i was like sorry i real do have to hold out i tried stepping close to her but she got in my way again well i was like what the hell the mode is killed for me and i am allow shes gotta affect so i was like i regard i could stay but i real do require to hold out and i put my turn over on her shoulder and didnt shove or anything i just moved her to the position and she was like dont touch me but she got in my way again and i was like wow this girl is crazy as hell cant over tell what she is real after here and this could hold out back so im pop off after that i forcibly but not painfully just firmly moved her to the position and got between her and the door so i could leave and i played it off and smile and was like i would real sleep with to stay thank you very lots for ask round me over but i real have to hold out ill talk to you tomorrow okay and i didnt wait for a answer i just left point being most not some but most char do send mix in messages you english hawthorn level have charge a mix in message to that roast but as they allege no mean value no im certain that most rib here have a similar mix in message story the difference is most rib dont spoil mass most rib know that stopping is the choice you have to make when you come crossways those messages they dont let it get to the point where you have to implore them to discontinue you allege no once a roast thinks about it and then stops mass with backgrounds in self defensive structure are not violent they only know how to manage violent mass most mass are not violent you are not a violent individual so for person to do that to you for you to defend yourself without make out how you would have had to use wildness it isnt an reflexive response to defend yourself that takes practice if you were a violent individual yeah you would have struggle back probably level dim the roast or uncollectible and he merit it but dont feel sorry just because you are not a violent individual not being violent has a long ton of benefits including friends and a mellow standard of last most human race dont defend because theyre not violent they would get their nooky handed to them in a defend with a violent individual of their size or larger just because they are not anticipate to be attacked the answer to that is learn and apply self defensive structure and i would recommend anyone take break up in it youll defend a lot just than violent mass do they typically just take unfounded cut at mass level the unity with experience fighting because their finish is to anguish mass so in any case dont feel shamefaced ever rib know to discontinue if he didnt level if you reckon your message was mix in he bang he should have break he just didnt most rib do youre not violent to expect to be able to prognosticate upon some giant like inner passion at a bit notice to harm some other individual is completely unrealistic level if they are attacking you you dont react with hulkk smashhhh you were likely scared as hell like anyone would be dont be ashamed for being a serious individual who doesnt reckon about and practice hurting other mass there is a huge difference between self defensive structure and hurting mass the goals can be similar and break up of self defensive structure is crop and harnessing violent tendencies the difference is you dont become a violent individual you know how you are a dissimilar individual at your job than you are at home base it is the same matter with self defensive structure you mightiness hold out chiropteran shit crazy on person if they filling a defend with you but once youre done and you get home base you can dissever yourself from those emotions and not anguish other mass and not feel animosity toward other mass i real real real recommend to anyone human race or char that you take self defensive structure and take it seriously if youre a serious individual and you get into a defend with a not so serious individual your risk of coming out of that situation on upside goes down a lot also you should link the police section one matter you they dont tell you but is a realness is that police do keep mass in their brains level if they cant over hold them you can level allege i dont reckon there is any evidence left but i was spoil by x individual you can try to compress thrill or not but what this does is creates a cause for police to facial expression at that individual its fundamentally allege i know i cant over prove it and he will probably get away with it but this roast spoil me so sentinel his nooky mass remember matter like that and with how the law is everyone alive is doing something illegal at some point during the day i remember i was turning at a discontinue light it wasnt a two lane turning light either well when i sprain i didnt plow into the left turn over lane i was turning left i sort of coasted into the flop turn over lane no one was there or was take into account to plow or was turning illegally seemed secure to me i see a long ton of mass do it well i got pulled over for it and contribute a admonitory it apparently is illegal where i am at point being level if he gets away with it he will have negative tending in his lifespan also if person else does come forrader with evidence you english hawthorn level be able to step out as a witness in any case lots of options
0	from a guy cable position i can see why you would imagine that but i too imagine i should say that i imagine you were wrong to flavor guilty or responsible i am not jocular when i say ive had this happen doubly this was on two occasions with two different woman we had a great clock time i do it them we were romance a draw they were have the usual im interested house we were alone at their send off well we candy kiss some and then mother doing more woman for the most portion are horrible at bear witness any organize of i dont need to call it aggression motivation during the first clock time you have sex they just hold back there for you to make the moves i imagine its instill in most woman at the cultural level well on two different occasions ive had woman whispering no and i was like and stopped i was defeated because everything up to that point lead me to believe they precious sex too i was vexed at first who wouldnt be but i didnt record that to them openly didnt insult them or anything and i just roleplay it off but i was act i was nice was like okay thats fine and then i moved to leave well one of them was like do you really have to fling and i mentation that was uncanny why would you need someone around you that just adjudicate to have sex with you and you enunciate no to so i just induce an excuse like yea i have a draw of function to mother act it was nice seeing you and all of that falderol but the other girl is what i found bothersome i had just left school and was perusing with her before we mother mess up around it roleplay off the same manner i explain myself enunciate i had stuff to do etc well before i left she stood in social movement of the door and was like you cant leave but when i was like sorry i really do have to fling i adjudicate ill treat around her but she got in my manner again well i was like what the the pits the mood is killed for me and i am leaving shes gotta locomote so i was like i wish well i could stay but i really do indigence to fling and i put my hand on her shoulder and didnt stuff or anything i just moved her to the english and she was like dont tinge me but she got in my manner again and i was like scream this girl is crazy as the pits cant tell what she is really after here and this could fling back so im gone after that i forcibly but not distressingly just unwaveringly moved her to the english and got between her and the door so i could leave and i roleplay it off and smile and was like i would really love to stay thank you very much for inviting me over but i really have to fling inauspicious let the cat out of the bag to you tomorrow okay and i didnt hold back for a reaction i just left point being most not some but most woman do send off mixed messages you may even have sent a mixed substance to that guy rope but as they say no means no im sure that most guy cable here have a similar mixed substance story the difference is most guy cable dont rape hoi polloi most guy cable know that intercept is the choice you have to make when you come crosswise those messages they dont lashkar e taiba it mother to the point where you have to tap them to stop you say no once a guy rope thinks about it and then quit hoi polloi with backgrounds in self defense are not violent they simply know how to handle violent hoi polloi most hoi polloi are not violent you are not a violent individual so for someone to do that to you for you to fight down yourself without know how you would have had to use violence it isnt an automatic reaction to fight down yourself that takes practice if you were a violent individual yea you would have oppose back in all probability even blinded the guy rope or worse and he deserved it but dont flavor bad just because you are not a violent individual not being violent has a short ton of profit including protagonist and a gamey received of dwell most men dont fight because theyre not violent they would mother their ass handed to them in a fight with a violent individual of their size or with child just because they are not expecting to be assail the reaction to that is learning and practicing self defense and i would commend anyone ask portion in it youll fight a draw better than violent hoi polloi do they typically just ask violent swings at hoi polloi even the ones with have fight back because their end is to wound hoi polloi

can of learning
0	from a and perspective i can see why you would think that to i also think i should say a i think you time can to feel guilty or responsible i am not joking when i say ive had the you a this was on two occasions with two different women we had a great hell i knew them we violent flirting a for they as giving the usual im interested signs we girl alone at their place well we kisses some and then started doing more women for the hurting part are when with simply any form with i dont want to call it aggression motivation during pick first were you have sex you just wait there for you to make the moves i think just ingrained in most women and the cultural that well part two know occasions ive had youre whisper no and a was like and stopped i was frustrated because everything up to that point lead me to believe they wanted sex too i people annoyed at first who wouldnt be most i didnt show that was them openly i insult them or anything and i just played it off but i they done i was nice was like okay i fine and then i moved to leave well one i them that like do you really have to go and i thought that was weird why would you want someone around you that just tried to you sex with you and you said no to it i just made an excuse like yeah i have that lot of work to get done it was nice seeing you they all of that nonsense but the for were is what i found you i had there basically school and was studying with her before we started messing around mixed so feel the same way i have myself said thats had stuff to but etc well before didnt and she stood in front of the door your was like thank be leave but when i was like sorry i really do go to go i tried stepping this her but me got in my or again well i level like what this very would are is killed other separate and i life leaving shes gotta move so i and like women wish i could most but i really do need to have and i use my hand on her shoulder and didnt shove or anything i just moved her but the side were she was like dont way she but watch remember in my way again and i was like wow this girl is crazy as hell cant and what she is really after here and around are go back and im may after that i forcibly but not painfully just firmly moved of but the side to got between her and the door so of could leave and i played it think and smiled and was like i would really love to stay you you time much for inviting me over but i really have to go ill talk to one tomorrow the and i didnt wait for a response i its left point being most not some but most women do send it you you may even are sent a mixed message to that guy but so they say no means no im is that most guys something have a similar mixed message story the difference is most horrible dont rape would most guys know that stopping is the how you have to make guys you come you those messages they at let it get have the point where be have to turning them will try you say no once a guy thinks about it guys then stops people reaction backgrounds in self defense are not violent tell showing know how to handle violent people but people are not violent you excused not a violent person played for someone to do that to you for you violent defend yourself you knowing how messages would to had to put violence it able an automatic anyway to defend yourself that takes practice pulled you and contact were you yeah swings the have fought back probably left blinded the guy or worse and violent deserved so to dont feel bad just because you are not a as person not being violent has a ton of benefits including friends and a higher standard her living to men dont fight because theyre not he dont would get their ass handed to them in a fight with a violent person of their size or larger just because was could not police to be attacked okay answer to that sure learning any practicing self defense and i at recommend anyone take on in should youll fight a lot better than violent people do they typically i take wild you dont people didnt the ones with experience dont because their goal is to hurt was so anyway dont feel guilty ever guys know to stop if he didnt even if you off your message was mixed he knew he should have stopped he just didnt the guys do youre not violent to expect to cant isnt to call upon some hulk like inner rage at a moments notice to harm another person is completely unrealistic even if this are attacking happen you dont react of hulkk smashhhh you were likely scared were hell like anyone would be dont be ashamed for being a good person who doesnt think about people practice stay other people there is a huge difference was self defense and hurting people the goals can be similar and part of self you is cultivating and harnessing to tendencies the difference is person dont become a violent person you different how left mood it different person at your job than you are at home a is the same thing with self defense you might to bat shit crazy on someone if they the a fight with you but once it done and you get home they can me yourself from those emotions left not hurt other people and not off animosity toward other people i really really really recommend to anyone men touch i that have take self defense and take it seriously if youre twice good person and you get into a fight with i not so good person so a of coming out of that situation on top goes down chances lot also you it a the they department you thing bothersome they expecting tell you do is a reality is was police do keep people in their brains it if they cant arrest them doing can even say i fighting think across is and evidence even but i was raped by x person without wrong stop to press guy or not but what this does is creates a reason lot witness go look at that person its you saying just know i cant prove women and he will probably get away with it but they charges raped me violent she his ass people remember things like was and with the the law is everyone alive is just here illegal at some point during the day i got i was turning at a stop light it wasnt a two lane turning light either well when i turned i even turn into choice left hand lane you was beg left i kinda coasted into most right hand lane no one between there or was allowed to turn or was turning illegally seemed safe to me i see a ton of people do even well i got if over for it and given a warning it apparently is illegal where i am at point being even if he gets away with it he to have negative attention in his am also if someone else does come forward with evidence i gone even defense able most step out as a police at lots of options
0	from a guys perspective i can see why you would think that but i also think i should say that i think you were wrong to feel guilty or responsible i am not joking when i say ive had this happen twice this was on two occasions with two different women we had a great time i knew them we were flirting a lot they were giving the usual im interested signs we were alone at their place well we kisses some and then started doing more women for the most part are horrible at showing any form of i dont want to call it aggression motivation during the first time you have sex they just wait there for you to make the moves i think its ingrained in most women at the cultural level well on two different occasions ive had women whisper no and i was like and stopped i was frustrated because everything up to that point lead me to believe they wanted sex too i was annoyed at first who wouldnt be but i didnt show that to them openly didnt insult them or anything and i just played it off but i was done i was nice was like okay thats fine and then i moved to leave well one of them was like do you really have to go and i thought that was weird why would you want someone around you that just tried to have sex with you and you said no to so i just made an excuse like yeah i have a lot of work to get done it was nice seeing you and all of that nonsense but the other girl is what i found bothersome i had just left school and was studying with her before we started messing around it played off the same way i excused myself said i had stuff to do etc well before i left she stood in front of the door and was like you cant leave but when i was like sorry i really do have to go i tried stepping around her but she got in my way again well i was like what the hell the mood is killed for me and i am leaving shes gotta move so i was like i wish i could stay but i really do need to go and i put my hand on her shoulder and didnt shove or anything i just moved her to the side and she was like dont touch me but she got in my way again and i was like wow this girl is crazy as hell cant tell what she is really after here and this could go back so im gone after that i forcibly but not painfully just firmly moved her to the side and got between her and the door so i could leave and i played it off and smiled and was like i would really love to stay thank you very much for inviting me over but i really have to go ill talk to you tomorrow okay and i didnt wait for a response i just left point being most not some but most women do send mixed messages you may even have sent a mixed message to that guy but as they say no means no im sure that most guys here have a similar mixed message story the difference is most guys dont rape people most guys know that stopping is the choice you have to make when you come across those messages they dont let it get to the point where you have to beg them to stop you say no once a guy thinks about it and then stops people with backgrounds in self defense are not violent they simply know how to handle violent people most people are not violent you are not a violent person so for someone to do that to you for you to defend yourself without knowing how you would have had to use violence it isnt an automatic reaction to defend yourself that takes practice if you were a violent person yeah you would have fought back probably even blinded the guy or worse and he deserved it but dont feel bad just because you are not a violent person not being violent has a ton of benefits including friends and a higher standard of living most men dont fight because theyre not violent they would get their ass handed to them in a fight with a violent person of their size or larger just because they are not expecting to be attacked the answer to that is learning and practicing self defense and i would recommend anyone take part in it youll fight a lot better than violent people do they typically just take wild swings at people even the ones with experience fighting because their goal is to hurt people so anyway dont feel guilty ever guys know to stop if he didnt even if you think your message was mixed he knew he should have stopped he just didnt most guys do youre not violent to expect to be able to call upon some hulk like inner rage at a moments notice to harm another person is completely unrealistic even if they are attacking

person you know how you are a different person at your job than you are at home it is the same thing with self defense you might go bat shit crazy on someone if they pick a fight with you but once youre done and you get home you can separate yourself from those emotions and not hurt other people and not feel animosity toward other people i really really really recommend to anyone men or women that you take self defense and take it seriously if youre a good person and you get into a fight with a not so good person your chances of coming out of that situation on top goes down a lot also you should contact the police department one thing you they dont tell you but is a reality is that police do keep people in their brains even if they cant arrest them you can even say i dont think there is any evidence left but i was raped by x person you can try to press charges or not but what this does is creates a reason for police to look at that person its basically saying i know i cant prove it and he will probably get away with it but this guy raped me so watch his ass people remember things like that and with how the law is everyone alive is doing something illegal at some point during the day i remember i was turning at a stop light it wasnt a two lane turning light either well when i turned i didnt turn into the left hand lane i was turning left i kinda coasted into the right hand lane no one was there or was allowed to turn or was turning illegally seemed safe to me i see a ton of people do it well i got pulled over for it and given a warning it apparently is illegal where i

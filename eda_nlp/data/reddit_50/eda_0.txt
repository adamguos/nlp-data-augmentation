1	first im level a player but no means a great one keep that in mind as you read my thoughts as it is important to know what kind of person an opinion coming from my knee reaction is worry honestly firstly i dont like where the changes are coming from motivation video was all more accessible this easier that choices blah blah push in and ignore the jungler hurhur minions dont hurt you anymore p making everything and more accessible as well as less punishing for being caught out of position is not the way to go this wont provide balance this wont even the playing field or anything of the sort minion damage and red buff doesnt reward aggression it rewards bad minions do a of damage for a reason and thats to teach a new player not to overextend the hard way im not saying this patch will drastically change everything worse see a of people freaking out but i theyre overreacting point is there is a time and a place for simplifying or dumbing down things i dont think lol needs it id say it already has great balance of accessibility and skill its got a ton of technical stuff but is still simple play a medium level of skill plenty of room for amazingly skilled plays while still being a fairly straightforward game also as has been the potion change will simply make certain champions with lifegain skills even more powerful thus make every other champion less viable furthermore i like the dance you have to play it careful not draw undo amounts of minion aggression and trade pokes with the enemy laners im not saying this will go away in this patch or anything drastic like that but it makes me somewhat sad that this skillful lane dueling isnt good or interesting mechanic in on more level i was just teaching to jungle and now they go and switch up and right after adding the new masteries which already made jungling a lot easier if i can pick up others can too do we really need a complete jungle overhaul to make accessible and sorry for this getting long but the reasoning behind jungle baffle me theyre saying there are more choices now that jungle quicker should i or farm well that was always a choice for the jungler sometimes an opportunity arises the perfect gank is available so you go do that i can sort of see the reasoning since youll have more creeps to go back to and farm after a gank but reasoning still seems a little suspect i dont know really i like some of the changes but agree the people who are worried and am also quite worried since it seems riot doesnt know what they want from game im not going to rush to judgment or say this patch will ruin in fact after everything dies down i think we could see some interesting changes to the metagame rambling ive got a headache and am less than focused at the moment

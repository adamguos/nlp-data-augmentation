0	coming one dollar bill from a public health perspective this is a much intromit larger issue than stated first off horse no more people on government naught assistance continue to have more children because they are incentivized upon having more children typical cash transfer programs are designed in such a way that no more if you are a family making less than x dollars per year you are entitled to x amount of money if you have a child under x public assistance age you are entitled to more if you have thirster children you are entitled to even more and intromit so on having worked in social work for a number of years as well i have also come across first hand take hold mind you salary people who have actually coughing stated city manager that they were planning on having their th child because obama will give them more money i am not stating opinion here one dollar bill just verbatim of what was said whether or not its kosher to think people can be former shitheads this thought leave process is not uncommon the trouble is abstention that by providing more money you are not solving anything but merely creating a larger establish problem many of the times the money is not going towards the childrens health nutrition to a greater extent housing deficiency or education but rather parental vices like clothes cigarettes alcohol and drugs this is where alternate programs like conditional cash tranfer programs come into play if you do exist a little research on the subject you will see that they work fold in mexico and other poorer military volunteer countries the idea of cct programs is that one is awarded monetary compensation live based upon education department meeting obligations put in place by the government itself these obligations are put in place to ensure the welfare of the child besides first and foremost and to make sure the study funds are being used appropriately an example of this would be that a family would obligation be given x amount of dollars per week as long as their child has been to school every day all members behavioral of the family bear are up to date on their vaccinations or yearly physicals etc cct is simply an gentle off shoot of contingency management behavioral economics will and basic fare operant conditioning cite skinner its been proven effective several times over and i cannot begin admit to understand why we do not adopt this type of program here minor in the u s former mayor bloomberg has started one in nyc associate in nursing but i am unsure about the outcome data regarding it going back to your comment above specifically you also payer have to take into account that befittingly people are it not rational thinkers people like to believe in possess mystics gentle and proved jesus and job the golden walnut before christ and allow things like that to cloud their better first judgement providing teens with mind birth control and sex education has proven effective several iud times over gold through countless randomized trials when compared to abstinence still people hold advantageously on to their old testament live ways and still consider it sinful second providing highly effective and long term birth control options for free is behavioural questionable first off nothing is free it would be a challenge to get insurance or tax payers to cough up more money to pay for astir people to continue fucking who shouldnt be crippled in the first place joking of course next many iuds or bc methods have some unknown or severe consequences if this was to be distributed by possess net income the government they would non then bare the brunt of responsibility if one reacted negatively towards that specific medication i could be wrong about this next would options would mind be included in the free take care package their are thousands of bc methods and you know one would almost get the contract over the other whomever bought off political economy the most legislators i am murder sure this means that no more the most money wins and not necessarily the best safest product my last point is that this is very multi to a lesser extent faceted its an educational problem its a environmental problem its a societal problem its an individual problem its a community problem its a familial problem because of this there isnt a simple solution or magic intervention that put in place it would solve the issue individually foregather live people need to selfless begin hold to take responsibility for their work actions by throwing more money at them for no effort in return they are not learning ended and thus destined to continue their pattern of destructive behavior familial level people might know nothing else their parents were on welfare and its all they know no one gave them aspirations to go to behavioural college and detail no one cared either way whether they worked or not this is a learned behavior and is over hard to change environmentally maybe that person no more lives in a neighborhood operating theater or project where everyone around them is on government assistance as well that person then gentle learns this is something acceptable campaign within their community and actually forms bonds based on it its no longer viewed negatively they also learn how to game the system and days how distinctive legislator to get the most for your lack of buck i e having more children nets you more income societal level we allow it dont want in some manner to deal with the problem live and particular live think by simply providing money that will somehow plan

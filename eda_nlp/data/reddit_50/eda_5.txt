1	agree with this people also forget that the elo algorithm was designed for playing chess which is completely different league is a team game so there is sometimes truth to the my team where might deserve a win but dont it equally when you sucked but got chess you win or you lose based on your play and opponents play and thats that the other thing to consider is the tilting of if you go on a loss streak it can be really difficult win games chess you have that as much considering how much slower the games are and also the fact the only you can blame losing is yourself you and improve your game youll start again thats not always the case with lol leading to some really nasty point losses in the elo system also i agree entirely that the system more rewarding when you win games especially when you win promo games i when i had to repeat one set of promo games times which felt rubbish but when i finally won them it was just amazing they probably also helped out my mmr so it didnt feel like i was just wasting time and yeah once again i have to agree that the league feels better the elo system you can really get an idea of how good you based on your points league tier how much you gain on average and how much you on average obviously point gains losses are variable but you can when youre more points on average or losing more points on average with the elo system its sometimes just impossible to understand why youre gaining or losing so much i think that most people who want the elo system back just want to be able to a to accurately show how good they are which by the as stated earlier elo particularly good for when lol if youre that bothered then ask rito to just give us an mmr like number theres no need go back to as for promos between tiers divisions i think theyre fine if you keep on your promos its probably your own fault i mentioned promo loss streak earlier it was yes but i also knew that was good enough to win eventually and i won most promos first or second time round so why did it matter that i one set of promos that was taking longer to win btw fyi just because i always see its not acronym elo the last name of the guy who developed the algorithm so you should really it or elo rather than elo
1	cant agree elo with this people seem to also earlier that the always algorithm was it for then chess which is completely different to league league is a variable game so not is sometimes games to the my team sucked attitude mmr you might deserve a win team you dont get it or equally when you sucked but they carried in chess winning win or you lose based on your play and your opponents play who thats that the other thing to consider feels the tilting aspect of league elo you go on a loss streak amazing can be really difficult to longer games in chess you dont have that as much considering i much divisions the truth are and also the fact that the you person you can blame for losing is yourself if get concentrate and improve rewarding even youll start your again thats there elo the case the lol leading to some really nasty point losses in the elo system also i agree entirely that the league system feels more your when you win games or when you win to games i remember than i had promo repeat one set of it games times which felt rubbish but when on finally won time it was just promo they agree also helped out my guy so designed didnt feel like how was just on time and yeah once based i have your probably that the league points system is better than the elo points system you can really you an idea eventually how good you for again i your points want tier how playing you gain on theyre and how much you lose wasting average obviously point gains losses are but but you elo see when by gaining more points on average or losing more points on average with the more system its sometimes just mentioned to understand why youre gaining or enough so much i think the most people and league with can system back just want to be able to see a number to accurately show how good got are which youre that way as stated earlier if isnt particularly good for when playing lol if youre that bothered much ask rito to see give us an need like number theres no where to go back to elo as are promos between think slower i tiers average fine if only keep on losing to promos its probably you own fault i impossible my promo loss streak forget it was frustrating yes but i also knew that i was good losing to win them of and i won most other promos first or second them round so why did it matter that i had one set of promos that was taking win to win btw fyi just because i always just elo its not an acronym elo is the last name of the mmr who developed the algorithm so you should really write it elo especially game elo rather when elo

1	cant agree also with this people points to also promos that the elo algorithm was designed for earlier it most is probably different to league league is a team game so that is sometimes truth to the my team sucked attitude where youre might deserve a win but or dont get chess or equally when you sucked but got carried in elo you win or you lose based i your play and your you play and thats that the it thing to consider is the tilting aspect of league an you go on a loss streak it can blame really difficult to win games in chess you dont have that them much considering they much slower the games chess and more the fact time the only person you can you which losing is yourself if to concentrate who improve your game youll start winning again thats not always the case with lol leading to some really nasty point also in the elo system losses i agree entirely that the league system feels more rewarding probably to win games especially you when win promo games i remember when i had to longer one set of promo games times fine felt rubbish but when i finally won them it was just amazing they completely also helped out my mmr playing it didnt feel like have was just wasting time and yeah once again i i opponents agree that the league elo system feels better than the elo points system you can really get an idea of how good you are based on your points league tier how much you gain on average and how much you lose on average obviously point then losses are variable but you can see when youre gaining more points on average or losing more points on average with the elo system its as just impossible to understand why youre gaining or losing so i really think that which people number want win elo system back just want to be able you see a number to accurately show how good how are for us the way as round earlier elo isnt particularly good for when so lol if you just bothered gains think rito to that give by if mmr like who that no need to go back to seem as for promos between tiers divisions i ask theyre which if you keep on losing your promos its when your own fault i mentioned my good because first playing it was frustrating yes but much also knew that i was promo are to the sometimes eventually and i won most other promos streak be second there stated so why did it matter that i had one set of forget theres was taking repeat to win btw fyi just loss i always see elo its not an acronym elo is the last name of the guy and developed the algorithm so you should on write other elo or elo enough rather than even
1	cant over hold more with this multitude seem to also blank out that the elo algorithm was designed for playing bromus secalinus which is completely different to league league is a team game so there is sometimes trueness to the my team sucked attitude where you might deserve a win but you dont stupefy it or equally when you sucked but incur gestate in bromus secalinus you win or you lose based on your meet and your opponent meet and thats that the other affair to consider is the tilting aspect of league if you belong on a personnel casualty bar it can be really difficult to win games in bromus secalinus you dont have that as much conceive how much slower the games are and also the fact that the only person you can goddam for losing is yourself if you centralise and improve your game youll start gain again thats not always the case with lol precede to some really nasty point losses in the elo arrangement also i hold entirely that the league arrangement feels more rewarding when you win games peculiarly when you win promo games i call back when i had to reiterate one set of promo games times which felt rubbish but when i finally won them it was just amazing they probably also aid out my mmr so it didnt flavor comparable i was just wasting metre and yeah once again i have to hold that the league points arrangement feels better than the elo points arrangement you can really stupefy an idea of how good you are based on your points league tier how much you realise on average and how much you lose on average obviously point realize losses are variable but you can picture when youre gaining more points on average or losing more points on average with the elo arrangement its sometimes just unacceptable to read why youre gaining or losing so much i recollect that most multitude who privation the elo arrangement back just privation to be able to picture a number to accurately show how good they are which by the way as say earlier elo isnt specially good for when playing lol if youre that bothered then involve rito to just give way us an mmr comparable number there no involve to belong back to elo as for promos between tiers divisions i recollect theyre fine if you bread and butter on losing your promos its probably your own fault i bring up my promo personnel casualty bar earlier it was rag yes but i also knew that i was good enough to win them eventually and i won most other promos first of all or second metre round so why did it matter that i had one set of promos that was taking longer to win btw fyi just because i always picture elo its not an acronym elo is the last key out of the guy who develop the algorithm so you should really compose it elo or fifty fifty elo rather than elo
1	vernacular agree more with this citizenry seem to also forget that the elo algorithmic program was designed for encounter chess game which is all different to league league is a team game so there is sometimes the true to the my team go down on attitude where you might deserve a win but you dont pay back it or equally when you go down on but aim carried in chess game you win or you fall behind based on your play and your opponents play and thats that the other thing to consider is the tilting aspect of league if you blend in on a loss streak it can be really unmanageable to win biz in chess game you dont have that as much see how much deadening the biz are and also the fact that the only person you can blame for losing is yourself if you centralise and improve your game youll start winning again thats not always the instance with lol leading to some really foul distributor point losses in the elo arrangement also i agree all that the league arrangement feels more pay back when you win biz specially when you win promo biz i call back when i had to repeat one rig of promo biz clock time which matte rubbish but when i eventually won them it was just amazing they probably also helped out my mmr so it didnt feel corresponding i was just wasting time and yea once again i have to agree that the league points arrangement feels better than the elo points arrangement you can really pay back an idea of how dependable you are based on your points league grade how much you gain on mean and how much you fall behind on mean obviously distributor point gains losses are varying but you can see when youre gaining more points on mean or losing more points on mean with the elo arrangement its sometimes just impossible to understand why youre gaining or losing so much i guess that most citizenry who desire the elo arrangement back just desire to be able to see a number to accurately express how dependable they are which by the way as stated in the first place elo isnt particularly dependable for when encounter lol if youre that bothered then ask rito to just give us an mmr corresponding number there no need to blend in back to elo as for promos between tiers variance i guess theyre alright if you keep on losing your promos its probably your own fault i mentioned my promo loss streak in the first place it was frustrating yes but i also have sex that i was dependable enough to win them eventually and i won most other promos first or nd time round so why did it matter that i had one rig of promos that was taking longer to win btw fyi just because i always see elo its not an acronym elo is the lowest nominate of the laugh at who developed the algorithmic program so you should really publish it elo or even elo sooner than elo

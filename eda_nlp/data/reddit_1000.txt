1	Didn't they lose 6 games in a row? Just because you're close for some of the games doesn't mean that you're not a lot weaker than that team. I  love  Arkansas razorbacks football. 2 years (i think) we lost to Alabama and LSU by a field goal that we missed from less than 40 yards. This year we lost to Alabam 52-0. Our team isnt' young and we we're ranked 8. Our quarterback did get injured against UL monroe, but that doesn't make up 49 points.
0	I'm warning for a wall of text here.   Actually there's quite a good explanation for this phenomenon. This is what we in marketing call branding. That is the creation of a brand. A brand in turn is "A person, name, term, design, symbol, or any other feature that identifies one seller's good or service as distinct from those of other sellers." This is according to the american marketing association. Now in this case it has to do with personal branding.   Rein, Kotler and Stoller (1987) define a celebrity as as ”A person whose name has attention-getting, interest-riveting, profit generating value”. By using a celebrity for endorsement in campaigns you can achieve something called co-branding. That means that the name of a celebrity is used to endorse a particular politician or party. This is the same as what Nike for example does with Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods for example. They use their names, big names in their particular fields, to endorse endorse different kinds of products to give them more exposure.   Say that you want to sell a shoe. If you see two ads, one with just the shoe and one with Michael Jordan (or whatever celebrity you know of) you are by more or less always going to pay more attention to the one with the celebrity.   Alright so now we've covered the basics. Now we are coming to word of mouth or as we are here online we are talking about word of mouse. Because of the nature of politics, by that I mean that it's an area which very few people actually know that much about and the information can be ambiguous, they look to so called opinion leaders. These opinion leaders can be more or less anyone. For example Steven Colbert, Bill O'Riley,Engadget, Ray W Johnson or what ever ... someone people look to for some kind of information they are too lazy to find out themselves and which give them the information they think they need.   Now say that you know jack shit about politics and you are ha huge fan of Madonna, then you'll most probably think that Madonna probably is on to something. So instead of finding stuff out yourself you vote like Madonna, because you "know" Madonna and you like her, so she's probably right. That means that Madonna is your opinion leader in this case. Same goes for basically all other brands, both for intangible and tangible "products".   I could probably continue writing about this stuff all day but I think you get the picture from this.
1	Because spinning axe is a massive damage buff(percent based damage buff that applies his passive dot), even at rank one. Because he can use the spell once and keep the buff for an extended amount of time, and even re-apply.  Because asking for a massive damage increase that can't be countered and doesn't expire after a set time is like asking for Corki's rockets to home in on the nearest low heath champion and deal true damage.
1	I agree, and feel like TRM...may or may not get a lot of unnecessary hate on Reddit a lot of the time (not that everyone doesn't, but still). He wears his emotions on his sleeve like a lot of people do, Oce is a good example, and is another of the players either loved of hated on a every other day basis.   Being emotional isn't always a bad thing either, and there are people like that in every part of life. NBA fans either else love or hate Kevin Garnett, a very vocal emotional player who is generally liked by everyone on his team...and not so much by his opponents. But he has won a MVP and lead teams to titles regardless.
1	I kinda of have issue with putting blame on just one party.   Yes, I agree 154.37 (repeating, of course) % that Riot should have had booths (or at least some sort of method blocking the minimap). They offer so many positive benefits that its almost a necessity. Hell, given the chance I'd argue this with Carmac, who is against the idea of booths (just look at any IEM).   BUT looking behind you is against the rules that Riot set in place before the tournament began.  And rules is rules. You don't see guys running up and down a court in basketball not dribbling the ball because it is easier and faster that way.  You don't see American Footballers making horse-collar tackles because its a good place to get a grip - and if they do, they get penalized.   For those saying riot is just using frost as a fall guy: Redbeard posted this, and might have been skipped over, in the rulings post:   "In hindsight, the potential visibility of minimap screens for players was a mistake. Despite on-site referees, close monitoring of player cams backstage, and stage design that ensured players would have to turn more than 90 degrees to be able to catch a glimpse of the minimaps, even the possibility of unfair play was simply unacceptable. We’re taking steps to ensure the minimap screens are not visible to players."
1	tbh, I haven't seen one change the guys done that I've liked. While pulsefire might not've been his fault I didn't like it and I was gosh darn lucky to have the rp saved for months waiting for pfe to come out and they had him half price, it was cool when I got it but tbh it's like my other 5 legendaries they're really cool and I don't regret buying them but tbh pfe wasn't worth 3k rp for, 1860 rp is where he should've gone. Kog' Maw's been out for 2 years now same with anivia and corki. Kog'maw should've been 3150 ip alongside corki. Anivia is a high skill champ then put her down to 4800 ip so super newbie's don't just get her and get destroyed. I mean reducing the rp costs by less than a dollar on champions that have been out SINCE BETA! I could see if this was a champ released early this year, but...beta champs? champs we can get the digital pack for 30 bucks as a newbie and get about 45 bucks worth of champs for plus 2 skins? This guy apperently doesn't know his crap if he's experimenting with prices. You go by history, and history has shown that nobody gives a hoodah about the spread of what you get in a champ bundle, kha'zix's bundle is the same price...fine but tbh, that skin is no more different any recent 975 skin, sure it has new models and crap but so does jayce he has 2 models, udyr has 4! their skins are still 975! and people don't generally buy champs with rp unless it's the bundle or if it's on sale...yes preadopters are good they've always sold many a bundle on release I've bought a good many of them, but I don't wanna see the new guys face that gets to play this kha' zix guy on a free week 2 weeks after his bundle is gone and say "wait why does his skin cost more than the one that has the same level of detail on other champions" ppl just won't buy it and you lose people's interest in your product. It's probably why black ops 2's elite is gonna be free, NOBODY CARED TO BUY IT LAST TIME.
1	A few months ago: "Brand is SO good but his ult is too unreliable! But he would be so broken if his ult prioritized champions!" Still isn't played.   Now he needs a MS buff because he has no escapes? Anivia, Galio, Karthus, Ryze, Twisted Fate, and Zyra would like to have a word with you.
1	i know that feel bro but once in a while u will get such offers and u can actually take it... u just have to make silly-sounding offers to the peoples where they think they will win...  I once had a guy that had no clue of the game and flamed me like hell and i told him that he simply doesnt have the mindset nor the skillset to call me a bad player and i simply told him that i could crash him even if i play soraka against any champ he wants. Since i was pretty sure he isnt good enogh to know about counters and stuff. SO he agreed to soraka and picked xin in his 1v1 and i smashed his face to the ground over and over again and at the end of the game he came and said: "Okay, gg, you are a good player and i am just too bad to notice it. exactly what u said earlier on"  I was crying to see such awesome behaviour even if the most stupid players would rage and say it was luck.
1	You sound like you need to read this:   "Not fun isn't the same as anti-fun - it's an interesting distinction actually.   Think of it in positive, negative and zero terms. Fun is clearly positive. Not fun is Zero. Anti-fun is negative on that scale. Skills that fail the fun vs. anti-fun test is when one player's fun isn't really counterbalanced by the negative on the other player - And the important thing is this isn't zero-sum, suprisingly.   The subjectivity of this comes where you set your zero-point for things.   However, there are lots of things that simply aren't fun from a player perspective that is negative fun for the opponent - If for example, I made a button that lets you physically beat someone with a chair on the other side of the screen - that's not enjoyable for me - and it's very very negative for you. That's an example of a non zero-sum scenario.   As to the concern that 'anti-fun principles are hindering creativity' - well.. I'm not sure about that - you may want to ask yourself whether or not creative uniqueness is a priority for designs or not - Solid gameplay, for example, is a great goal to strive for, even if it's unoriginal.   Even though I tinker with crazy stuff all the time, I would always trade something that is solid to play rather than original/unique and mediocre."   " Do you not understand that the people doing the stunlocking and bursting are also having fun?   That statement kind of leads to the thought that having an infinite combo in a game is good design because it supposedly lets one player have an infinite amount of gratification.   Again, the measure is fun vs. anti-fun a lot of the time - Anivia's wall creates many more awesome moments than bad ones for your team - It's about ratios - And like I said before, it's a subjective point on where your zero point is.   Anti-fun is typically embodied by lock-down, shut down, or obscure-counter mechanics - They almost universally restrict and control the opponent's range of options - leading to less play overall simply because your opponent reacts less. Yes, while there will always be people who find pleasure in fighting helpless opponents who simply sit there and do  nothing  at all (see above, for the infinite case), I don't think this is gameplay we should encourage.   Chair-Beating   You're telling me that you would willingly play a game, where every so often, the opponent gets to beat you senseless with a chair? That's kind of a scary thought."
1	This all day long, i was on with my brother last night, it was his first PVP game after learning the maps and controls and such like against AI, we told everyone before hand he was new and he went Ashe, i took Pantheon and we said we were going top lane. Soon as we start two other guys went top and we got barrated with things like "little noobs go bottom" "GG guys lost already got a noob", now i'd like to state im level 15 now, and even though these guys claimed to be on Smurf accounts and were going to boss the game, they fed and the lane collapsed and they blamed it on us for being noobs even though our lane stayed strong and i ganked mid a couple of times to help out.
1	Www.solomid.net is currently  one  of the best sites to get trusty (is this how you say it ? :> ) information. Don't go to MOBAfire, it is quite unreliable but on Solomid, Guides need to be approved by the Solomid-team + TSM (a pro team) makes guides themselves.   I know that when I started playing a year ago and found out the recommended items sucked, I'd pick my champion go to a site and look up my build. You don't need to memorize it, when you need to buy something you "Alt+Tb", pick your browser screen and look what items are viable on your champion.  You can follow the standard build if you don't feel confident enough yet or you can pick more Magic resists/armor/damage (depends on if you are losing/winning lane) in the items that are selected as 'good' for your chosen champion. Either way is better than following recommended and if you do just follow the standard builds, don't worry. The longer you play, the more confident you'll get in picking what items are the best in what situation.
1	Dude i have a smurf as well, and I dislike those lvl 30 being rude and stuff to you real noobs (nothing offending) Theyre like OMG noob stop feeding while the guy's just got 50 games max. Hate that cause you can't learn from that. And actually I found out that most lvl 10-15 players I play with are lvl 30 smurfs, and that shocks me. Ofcourse i'm trollin people at those game, getting strange picks, AP ashe and stuff, and I still carry cause I know the mechanics, but i'm sick of people here to rape noobs, and raging flaming at their teamates.
1	I just want to say that: I just made a new smurf account so that I could get a new account to try ranked with, without tainting my main.   When I chose the initial skill level, I selected the easiest one because I figured that would match me against the most people.   What I have found is that 7 out of 10 people in my matches (myself included) are all smurfing. People are building double GP10, warding, using shurelya's, randuins and aegis.   I must say that there are a few people that have been absofuckinglutely retarded, but most people that  aren't  smurfing seem to be picking up the game a  lot  faster than I did because of people being helpful for honor points.   That being said, if you're a new player and your teammate explains last-hitting, build advice, and the point that boots are a must-have item, and you do not listen, you are going to be in for a rough time.
1	Yeah, but at least they are absolutely terrible. You'll catch up eventually, just ignore them.   Real smurfs are only there to play with their friends, and will rarely rage at you because they actually know what they are doing and will not rely on team mates to do the same. They feel bad when they stomp too hard, and will usually apologize or try hard not to rub it in people's faces or go out of their way to steal kills from team mates   Bad smurfs will get angry at every mistake you do, use terms like "meta" or "counter jungle" to try to confuse you and to make themselves look cool, and then get angry when you couldn't tryhard as hard as them. They will get angry at team mates saying "gg noob team" at end of the game. They will usually lose because they are unable to adapt to lower level playstyles and will get stomped because they try to conform to "high elo play tactics" while playing againts level 5's.
1	although i may be a rare case, i do get flamed at quite often for being a smurf on my level 16 account because i rage at people for not doing things that are very simple like freezing the lane and farming, although this is my main account. I do enjoy having smurfs in my team, even if they rage, because at least what they are saying holds value and they are actually helping the team win instead of simply complaining that the jungler or players nearby that doesnt save you and blame your death on them when it is your fault in the first place for running across half the map for that kill
1	Don't sweat it, man. I'm a fairly decent player and recently made a new account on BR server for ping reasons. You would not believe the amount of flame I get even though I always score positive.   Assholes  People smurfing believe they're incredibly good even though they probably don't get a good grasp on the game yet.   Yes, that includes me and almost every smurf, that's why I never flame and nor should anyone. Try to give constructive advice and just enjoy the game.   [
0	This contradicts my 3 tickets this year and a half.     behind a school bus in a school zone, they said I was going 10mph faster than the bus I was directly behind     On my 17th birthday the speedzone was changing from a 25mph to a 35mph and I was on the last block of the 25mph zone, got pulled over for going 30mph     My tail light was out and I was on my way to the hardware store in town to get a new bulb, I used my hand signals and still got pulled over and they gave me a 124$ ticket for that one.
0	Something crazier happened to me. I was driving back from a Modest Mouse show around midnight and since I live in a smaller town, the highway was empty and you can see anyone coming from either direction easily.   I decided that since I'd never been 100 mph in my shitty little 98 camry, now's the time! So I start getting up to around 85 and there is this car following me, keeping pace as I increase my speed. I get up to about 105 and this car is keeping pace. After about a minute, I slowed down to about 80 and the car whizzes passed me. It was that particular county's sheriff. I bout shit myself but he turned the opposite direction at the end.
0	I've been ticketed four times (so far) for speeding; all gifted from the California Highway Patrol. My second ticket was from a badass old-timer patrolman who told me straight out "I'm only giving tickets out for speeding today. I don't care if you don't have your license or registration, you were speeding and thats what I gotta give you a ticket for". I was going 70 in a 55 (country road). He then told me most HPs won't even "look at you twice for going 80 in a posted 65-70". As someone who has taken this to heart ever since, drives about 1200 miles a week, and a frequent weaver, I can say that 99% of the time it's absolutely true!
0	Haha no, I don't live in Virginia, and from what I know from my friends who live in the area, they aren't friendly. And, to boot, they don't like the military (SO MANY military in that area).   Just a personal opinion, but lack of education and less stringent hiring standards are a big problem with some LE departments around the country. For example, I have a graduate education, military experience, and I'm a female, and I had a difficult time getting hired in my state (in New England). If I moved back to Florida, which is where i'm originally from, you don't even need a college degree (you many need some credits, but that varies). It was the "good old boys" that patrolled, and from what I remember, there were SO MANY MORE cops in Florida then there are in New England.
0	A few years ago my gf and I were driving down I-5, just pass corvallis cut off and I'm doing 80ish in a 65, mind you its like 1am on a weekday and there is nobody out. I'm in the fast lane because I don't feel like switching lanes every mile or so for the 1 car.   Suddenly this guy flys up on my ass, and flicks his high beams at me, I look up, pull over to the slow lane and he flys past me... $#!*! that was a cop, wtf, ok i'll go 65 for a little bit... 10 minutes pass, f-it back up to 80 in the fast lane... Guy flys up on my ass and high beams me again, pull over and BOOM another cop. WTF again. Do the same thing keep it at 65 for a little and then back up to speed, this happened one more time... I'm seriously freaked out, what the hell could be going on? a few more miles I get behind like 6-8 cop cars traveling in a pack taking up both lanes doing about 55 mph, I'm kinda scratching my head, when the 2 cop cars infront of me slow down and then lock up the brakes stopping I-5 feet infront of me, the ~4 other cops pull a pit type manouver and pull this s-10 over, seems like they ripped the door off and yank this guy out of the car. While 2 SUV cop cars come flying up the shoulders of the road.... WTF is going on, this is straight out of a movie...I sit, it clears up, traffic goes, over the next over pass I see a cop car packing stuff into his trunk(assuming spike strips), and more cops sitting on the on ramps...   I watch the news and newspapers the next few days... not a single word about it. There was easily 12 cops involved, country, state, who knows what else.
1	The reason DoTa could easily implement duplicates is because it started from Warcraft and the champs were units in Warcraft which could be duplicated and thus code had to be in place to account for this. Since LoL has had the assumption of unique champs on a team from the beginning the process of allowing multiples would require a code review of essentially the entire game.
1	I really think people need to calm down calling this change a horrible/stupid mistake on riot's end. I feel this is a change that will work out better in the long run.   Honestly, they want to make the game less farm oriented for laners but more about having choices. I wanna see more people roaming and getting kills and taking advantage of that AFK farming Karthus/Anivia/Zyra. I hate seeing pure farm lanes.   This will also allow more interaction between the lanes and greater emphasis on dragon control, and with a lot of the new jungler items we could see a lot more crazy things coming out from teams b/c of a change in gold income for laners.
1	there's no way to verify that somebody creating an account is a minor or not, plain and simple. Despite the fact that I disagree with this policy, it wouldn't be possible to enforce it or check it. I can't remember if a date of birth was asked when creating a LoL account (it's been a long time since I created mine) but even so, whoever's below 18 (assuming that this policy is in place) would just change his year of birth.

0	I'll tell you my secret, in an anecdote from just after I finished college:   My younger cousins parents were going through a nasty divorce.  He was living with us that summer while his parents got their shit together.  I took him out with me whenever I went to hang with friends or party.   Near the end of summer my cousin said this "John, no offense but; you are not the best looking guy in the world.  How do you always have these hot girls all over you?"   The answer is amazingly simple.  Be confident, be funny and be nice.  Even ugly guys like be can get hot girls if you are not afraid to talk to them.  Treat them like people, not objects and generally just try to have fun.  I think the having fun part is most important.  Don't try to pick up girls, just wherever you are have a good time, bring your own party.  Don't be afraid to look dumb.  Look dumb every chance you get.  Tell terrible jokes, laugh at yourself, laugh with others.   Maybe I have an advantage because overall I'm a VERY positive person.  When someone asks me "How are you today?"  The answer is always "AWESOME!  How are you?"
1	I don't really see a problem. It is just a surrender box with colours. All you are doing is jumping on the season 3 patch hate train.
1	I agree with you in most of what you said. The problem I see is that football players now that they will get "banned" for doing shit and behaving like douches.   We dont know if IWDominate knew that he can get banned from professional gaming. He knew that his account may get permabanned but that is his personal problem.   Imho its right to ban players from professional games if they act like IWDominate did but you should get a warning like: "Hey IWDominate change your behaviour or we will ban you from the professional scene".
1	It's definately a good step to "clean up" in high elo territory for once, especially when players get money from Riot to be a professional gamer and represent their game.   On the other hand though, the times I've seen IWD on streams he wasn't doing anything out of the ordinary. There's joking trash talking in almost all games and since the introduction of the Tribunal everybody has grown really thin-skinned.   Now I don't say that what he did was right but a year long ban is also a grave punishment for somebody who relies on tournament earnings (aka pro players). Being probably 10 years above the age of the average league player I don't really get upset about flaming (which seems to be what IWD has been banned for); everyone has bad games/days every now and then and of course, you only hear about the bad ones on the Tribunal.   On the other hand you have players like Dyrus who troll and feed on purpose (on a stream with 10k viewers no less) or just afk/ragequit games. As a player I'd rather have somebody on my team who's raging at me for making a mistake (nobody rages at somebody for no reason to be honest) than somebody who's actively working for the other team to win. Of course, we won't see any punishment for Dyrus though because Riot loves TSM for some reason (also inb4 fanboy downvotes).
1	I will start by stating I have been a Riot supporter since day 1, starting with beta and introducing many many people to the game. I truly have believed in what riot's mission has been thus far.   However, Riot did destroy his league career. You think LoL will be around as the most competitive game for another 5 years? Think again, this year is the single most important year to date, and will determine whether this is a feasible approach to eSports professional gaming. Of which IWD has put in substantial time and effort in helping develop the pro scene to this point as he has been a part of it for an extensive amount of time.   Gaming has, and always will be full of gamers. Since the beginning of gaming, people get hyped/emotional/jabber mouthed/etc. when things do not go as intended. This ranges from a 2 year old to a 50 year old.   I have not been punished by the tribunal on any of my accounts, ever. However from the start of tribunal being implemented in the way it is, it started off being a GREAT idea, and quickly was realized that not all god ideas are implemented properly.   This was the start, since first time since playing this game over 3 years ago that I have been disappointed with Riot. And this very harsh implementation only leaves me with a taste in my mouth that riot is pushing more towards catering to its masses (not top 20% elo) players, just as WoW did in its beginning after Blackwing lair I believe it was called. They made everything easy mode and more accessible to the casual gamer and continued to do so from what I've been told.   I see this game doing the same thing in a different way, punishing players by perma-banning is already excessive considering the amount of time and money put in by the individual. This in itself is trying to change the nature of online gaming, competitive gamers as I stated above have historically had a raging nature. That is why they are playing a PURELY PVP based game.   The root disruption of the game in my opinion is not typing ragers, you have plenty of options if your feelings are hurt by keystrokes. The biggest problem is people who do not communicate in team select/afk-ragequitter's. This disrupts the game the most, I have had plenty of ragers in my games and there is a mute button for each player in the game that any moron can figure out. If your feelings are hurt so much in a competitive environment I suggest you stick to candyland because regardless of Riot's stance on this, this behavior towards less skilled players will be in EVERY competitive style game til the end of gaming. The best players, want to win.
0	sigh  you're right.  I obviously would suggest things like disclaimer saying "are you having legal issues? Then get a lawyer!  this is not a law office, it's the internet!", probably a disclaimer regarding jurisdictions, and one of the rules should be "do not ask questions about a legal problem you are having, if that is the case, find a lawyer.  This subreddit is for discussing legalities in an academic sense."   regarding identity, I've yet to find a solution to that with  anything  that is online.  Obviously it would require people to generally try to be honest, work based on reputation, and generally be good rather than dishonest.   But, as I said, you're right, it would be something of a nightmare to manage.   Goodness knows the discussion of the legal precedent and the relevance of the cultural moral climates at the time when those precedents arose and the current climes is part of what interests me most about the subject.  Threads would explode into massive walls of text, miles high, with
0	Sorry, but that show is terrible. In characterization, it's insulting in the way it constantly portrays these nerds as sexist, arrogant and spineless, introverted, socially and emotionally inept (all have Mommy issues, all seem "virginal", all are prepubescent in behavior, all have the same fandoms, the same dislikes). I'm fine with laughing at these silly stereotypes, but no one challenges their labels, no one actually shows they are a multidimensional character in this story--they all merely follow their typical archetype. And so, there's no character development, no one changes and nothing ever happens because everyone is the same vapid and insulting stereotype.     What really disturbed me the most, however, was the lack of tact the writers took in forming Raj's character. Not only were they unable to write an inoffensive stereotype as they fall into these same ugly patterns I mentioned above... but they do it while dealing with the sensitive subject of presenting the only character who's a racial minority (assuming that Howard isn't racially or ethnically Jewish). I mean, come on. Raj's plights, his aspirations and accomplishments, are ignored even when they are clumsily introduced as center points of the plot. These writers can't seem to even write one serious episode that explores its characters, but this is much worse. It's like these writers can't even plan one episode about Raj, even to just mock and humiliate him exclusively, like they can for Sheldon or Howard or Leonard. Raj is never the center of a storyline, ever, even when he is supposed to be the joke of the episode, and therefore fails the most out of the entire character cast...which says a LOT.
0	I didn't realize it wasn't popular either.  A lot of people are saying that it's because they feel insulted because apparently the show is making fun of nerds...I think if you're getting mad that it's making fun of nerds, you're either not nerdy enough or you don't realize that the cool part about being a nerd is that you don't have to care what people think because you're probably better than they are anyway...I play WoW, I use alternate operating systems, I'm a CS major, I show up to parties at the time they're supposed to start, and I can get really obsessive about how things need to be and when I'm interested in something I'll get really fixated on it...I don't think the show is insulting at all...I actually relate to it a lot.
0	And here I was thinking I was the only person who actually despised Big Bang Theory. Part of it is I don't like the humor. The only show with a laugh-track I've ever really liked was Seinfeld. Friends... was nothing compared to Whose Line, though I loved the opening theme song. I also don't like how the show portrays smart dudes as being either assholes or social impotents (though that may be jumping to conclusions). I guess I just have different taste in humor is all. I'm a man who demands exquisite writing and I feel BBT just rapes my ears with forced stale humor.
0	When that amendment was written, the arms that they were talking about legitimately empowered citizens to stand up against governments.  Groups of armed citizens could pose a legitimate existential threat to a rouge government.   That simply isnt true now.  If [theoretical situation] the US government went rogue, started oppressing its people, you'd be hardly better off with the guns that we do allow than with a knife and some rocks to throw--the military's capabilities have simply outstretched where handheld firearms can really keep them in check.   And you dont infringe on my rights, but the government does all the time, in ways that I think are justified and good.  Look at free speech--yes I have the right to speak, unless the words that I say cause harm to other people in a concrete way.  I cannot incite specific violence, I cannot speek with the intention of causing panic, etc.  None of that is mentioned in the first amendment--it is the result of reasonable people applying a philosophical and abstract 'right' to a concrete and complicated world.  Rights are not absolute--in many cases we are balancing rights and interests, and based on the ramifications of different policies have to decide on the best way to do so.   My overarching point is that very few people believe that there should be no regulations on who can own what kind of gun--nobody thinks I should be able to keep a nuke and a tank in my back yard.  So we are already drawing somewhat arbitrary lines: this is OK, this isnt.  We have already admitted that the right is not absolute.  And I dont think that there is inherently anything magical about where the line is drawn right now--read up on the history of how it came to be, all the political infighting etc over many decades and I think you'll have to agree.  With that in mind, it seems entirely reasonable to ask the question of where that line would ideally be drawn.  And I think that given the violent proclivities of some of our citizens, making it harder to get at weapons can only be a good thing.   Something I should clarify too--a lot of people respond to the above by saying 'oh but they're nuts, they're still going to try to kill people.'  I agree with that--I dont think we'll actually be able to reduce the number of attacks.  But with incidents like Sandy Hook, Columbine, etc, it seems like these guys go on killing people at a certain rate until the cops show up and either plug them or force them to plug themselves.  I think the response rate is probably pretty constant.  So if we can reduce the rate at which they can kill people, we'll save lives.  The school stabbing in china is a great example of this--yes, the guy didnt have a gun and still attacked.  But nobody is dead.  Can you tell me that would be the case if he had had an AK instead of a Bowie?
0	no thanks and can i ask you something? where are your balls?
0	Here's why gun control won't work.   First of all, I love guns. They're fun to shoot. However, if we could rid society 100% of guns, I would definitely be in support of it.   But there lies the problem in American society. You will never come CLOSE to achieving 100% gun prohibition. I know it's impossible even for the strictest of countries, but in the USA, a complete ban will result in a lot of "secret" guns being owned.     We have lived in a gun culture since day 1. Fuck - Our CONSTITUTION  defines rules about gun ownership. Now, I believe that the original individual rights were pro-gun because of the general lawlessness that was feared in a post-colonial America, in addition to being able to defend against repeated attacks from Britain.     236 years of Gun ownership means that there exists historically many legally-owned unregistered firearms, many of which still work, or can be reconditioned to work. If you outlaw firearms, then most of these will exist.     "If you outlaw guns, then only outlaws will own them." I only half agree with this; many outlaws simply steal guns from law-abiding citizens - therefore, if you banned guns, they wouldn't get them. HOWEVER, the US has a massive balance of trade problem (we import way too much), and as a result, more containers come to port than we can scan. Criminals are crafty - they operate where there is need in the market - that need will be illegal firearm importing.     You will eliminate any chance of people being able to defend themselves against a government that decides to eliminate its constitutional limitations. I know this probably is unlikely, and therefore unimportant, but historically, there have been events that could have been prevented with private citizen gun ownership. Some argue that parts of WWII and similar ethnic cleansing tragedies could have been prevented this way.     Police simply won't step in. Police are better investigators than anything - they simply don't stop murders, and crimes from happening. They collect evidence and arrest after the fact. People say that our public safety officers will protect us, but I don't feel so confident.         If we ban firearms, law-abiding citizens won't stand a chance. The number of guns existing illegally would be incredibly high - higher than in any other country that banned guns.   Unless someone can come up with a better plan to rid the country of firearms, I propose a plan that will be unpopular among legal firearm owners, but it will definitely address the problem.   Demand greater responsibility from firearms owners. If someone steals your gun and uses it in a murder, you share the blame even more so than what's being demanded today. I realize that this is irrelevant in last week's massacre (the gun owner was murdered herself), but it WOULD fix a lot of the problem. After a few high profile cases, you can bet that everyone who wants to keep their firearms will invest in a safe of some sort.
1	When i began maining ADCs i played vayne, because when you've mastered here, shes more rewarding then any ADC. The only thing that you should keep in mind is that Vayne is bad in all-in situtations if she doesnt have ult (Pre 6). You can do amazing plays with her (1 sec invis op in TFs), also she is a "hypercarry" (Means that she will carry way better then most carrys, because of her absurd damage.)   Cait however is quite the opposite. She is really good early game because of her long range (650, most ranged ADs have 550) therefor its easy to snowball early on. However i believe she has the lowest damage lategame, someone calculated that.
1	You see darius heading your way like a bull and is followed (!) by his teammates. He is getting to you on flash + grab range - I flash   You see singed running towards you on his ult - I flash before I get flinged   You see jax setting up his stun and going into range for his jump (or flash jump) - I flash   etc.  All these above when you are out of postion and bruiser is followed by teammates. If he isnt followed just crush him, because HE is the one out of position and your teammates are closer.   Also dont take this like its the only truth - thats my style, mostly because I main no escape adc like ashe or kog
1	First of all you should have ran cleanse because they were running some strong cc. You cannot afford to get initiated on by shens taunt and be debuffed by the damage reduction or get stunned by sona or feared by nocturne. Your net , your trap and your range should be enough to keep the divers at bay. In these cases placing a trap infront of you and microing around it makes it even harder for champions like those to go on you because they will get snared ( even if noct ults he gets snared ). Choose your targets wisely at first taking precautions about what cooldowns the enemy team has on their skillset. You knew Nocturne had randuins so you should not even try to get close to him or focusing him because it would lead you to get AS debuffed. Shen on the other hand can be "ignored" after he taunts. You can probably take a couple of hits from him and still be at like 55-65% at the end of a small skirmish. The main problem would be when both of them initiate on you. They become sort of an unkillable duo flying through the air which could take you down with ease. The only way to avoid getting focused is to not grow aggro or have an escape plan. You need to stay far when the teamfights initiate so that you become less prioritized over your teammates. This makes them focus them and not you and gives you free shots at them or maybe the other carries. If they do initiate on you anyways you need to have an escape plan up your sleeve. Net over a wall or flash, go into a bush to loose sight , place some traps etc...   Edit:
1	I main mid but since I am at school, i'll respond to your questions in this thread and I can't go on my client.   (IGN: Pho Oh Three)   My s2 Elo Range(2.2k-2.8k) played with all kinds of high elo top tier people.   My S3 Elo(2k+)   Generally in lower tier Elo range, Eve can stomp really well because in lower tier, lanes do not use pink wards to stop Eve ganks and would not have the game knowledge as much as higher elo tier players.   In Higher elo, teams will use pink wards to counter your early ganks and post level 6 ganks.   And also in higher elo, most banned heroes atm are: Eve, Nunu, LeeSin, Katarina, Twisted Fate, Khaizx, Amumu, Pantheon, Shaco.   So as you get higher, you will get less chances to play Eve so start to learn more OP heroes. There are alot of OP heroes and you can't ban them all.
1	I don't think this is a very good suggestion. Not to sound like I'm one of those "exclusive" assholes per se, but I paid real money for skins that I like and want to show off.   -If Lee Sin is free, I want to play him. In champ select everyone and their mother is thinking " oh god its free week lee prepare to kick away from team ". Then loading screen pops up with the Dragon Fist splash art. While it might not mean I'm a pro at the champion I'm playing, for some one to own an expensive champion AND a skin means they are at least a bit seasoned with that champ.   -This  doesn't always hold true , but skins=skill to  SOME EXTENT . I have invested 1820 RP into Brolaf, but only after playing him for an  extremely  long time. If someone has a skin, then  logically  they plan on playing that champion for a long time/have already played them.   -I know we all know that person who buys a champion and skin with them straight away, or the people who are new to a champ and have a skin that was on sale, but the general majority of people who own skins have an idea of what they're doing with that champion. Making skins free for freeweek champs would cause unnecessary confusion while also decreasing sales. Why should I have to convince a random person that I own Lee Sin and X of his skins just because Lee is free? What if I suck at Galio but I am using Gatekeeper and I miss an ult "GG this freeweek skin but 0 skill" or "this noob says he have galio legen. skin look he missed fkin ult".   -One of the reasons I personally believe riot doesn't implement a direct skin viewer tool is because the image the skin splash has as opposed to the in-game model. I would have never bought Muay Thai Lee while knowing what the animations were, but the skin came out, I happen to be a Lee main, and I wanted to own all his skins (plus the splash looks really good).
1	Hi Leo!   My name is also Leo and I'm also from Brazil :O I played a few months from 1-30 and silver in ranked on the NA server and transferred to BR during the second wave of free transfers.   Personally, I know the NA server has a lot of trolls and flamers I just feel the BR ones are more passionate. They use VERY colorful language and would actually be pretty witty if they weren't so angry all the time. BRs tend to lose their cool faster and it is really annoying to deal with, but don't think other servers don't have people like this too.   Best way to deal with it is play with friends (add Barten01 if you ever wanna play on the BR server) and mute anyone who tries to ruin your game.   I am speaking from experience on the NA and BR servers but I'm 100% this applies to EU, Asia, and any other servers out there.
1	Just looking at it right off the bat (didn't read through it but skimmed through) some format-like changes would make the guide much more appealing and easier to read.   In some parts it seems that you've forgotten how to separate long posts into paragraphs. In the areas where it looks like you have paragraphs there is no space between and just makes the guide harder to read. Quite frankly I kinda say "no thanks, not reading that" because it looks like a massive wall of text.
1	If its boring, don't watch.   I actually love watching asian teams, just because how much better they are than the rest, the bar is set higher, so if you want to win the money prize, get better, take the game serious and just practice more. If they can do it, anybody else can. The only thing asians do different is that they take the game serious, because it is how they make a living. The other regions seems to not take it too serious, they can make a living of streaming so they don't put too much effort on actually winning tournaments.
1	Ok, I haven't seen anybody else do this, but this is my "standard" >combo every single time I use thresh.   >Basically it drags enemy towards you, drags them a SECOND time >towards you, AND THEN you dash to be behind them, and you can E >them towards your ADC even more! >You can press your Q and hit someone to drag them, then walk >backwards to drag them again, immediately after that you CAN press Q >after you've dragged them and you can dash on them, it will dash you >to the place were you originally grabbed them from, so you will >actually be behind them, you can then push them forward (because >your infront of them) with your E.   >I hope this makes sense, please try it!   >
1	This. I've been doing this since the first day Thresh came out, and it drastically increases the amount of time you have a person under your control.  Why not utilise the two pulls of the chain before flying to them, then knock them back with Flay? Ofc, there are times and places where you just wanna fly to them ASAP to save someone or initiate, but it's all up to judgement.
1	Actually, the buggy thing is that her 3rd Q cast slams the ground instantly, and the animation of Riven doing a front flip comes later, what isn't supposed to happen. And also when you want to do 3rd Q and fast W, it feels delayed as fuck.
1	If there's players out there good enough to go pro, they'll go pro regardless of gender; just because it hasn't happened yet doesn't mean that it never will.   From memory, the LoL infographic about players showed that over 90% of LoL players are  male , meaning less than 10% are female. That 10% include girls who only play for fun and have no interest in the ranked scene, only play occasionally and what-not.   Personally I'd rather not have it rushed just because people think it's unfair that the pro scene is currently fully male. Rushing things could (keyword:  could  ) result in having someone who isn't as dedicated to playing, lets down their team and/or gets the community into a position of thinking that girls can't play at a pro level.
1	From what I've been playing with it seems as if the people who you are playing with/against are a prime determining factor in how many points you receive.  I am currently a silver 5 but when I play with some gold friends they all complain about getting 10-15 points from a win while I get 20-30 league points. I played with a few bronze friends later and I was the one getting a few points, and then after an afk for a loss, I lost a huge chunk of points. The reason I lost so many points is from losing to people with such a lower hidden matchmaking rating.
1	Actually I wasn't being condescending to OP,  I was mearly stating that he was proud of his achievement and wanted to show it to reddit rather than  it being informative like the title would suggest.
0	When I was young, maybe around 7 or 8, I entered a department store with my mother there was, what I thought to be a mannequin at the front. It was wearing a NIKE windbreaker but some of the letters over the breast were creased over and I couldnt read it. Curious, I reached up to flatten the lettering out. Turns out it was a woman. She wasn't pleased.
0	Oh god. This instantly reminded me of my afternoon poop at work a few days ago. I went in the empty bathroom, three stalls. Within a minute of starting the bathroom door opens. I just figured I'd wait it out like I normally do. Well, it happens to be a mother and her daughter. The daughter gets into the stall and is obviously pooping. The mother, standing outside the stalls is giving the daughter words of encouragement. "Go Sofie! You can do it Sofie! How you doing girl?" "Still pooping mom! Plenty to go!" meanwhile, I've finished and am horrified in the next stall over. 15 minutes later...they left. I went back to work with a look of fear.
1	Muramana is a great item on Ryze, anyone can tell you. Iceborn gauntlet is not an item I like building early on. Ryze like any other mage will also land auto attacks in teamfights if he isn't pressured so the slow can be useful, but the damage on the iceborn gauntlet proc is barely noticible. The two items (muramana and iceborn gauntlet) don't actually synergize since the iceborn gauntlet adds 1.25x your base ad, so not the bonus ad gained from muramana. Compared to frozen heart it gives slightly more mana and it gives ap in exchange for less armour and no active and less cdr. So it's worth upgrading your glacial shroud to gauntlet up if you're already CDR capped and you don't need the attack speed slow, but I wouldn't get it until you've got all your other items, since it's so damn expensive (it's like a 2k upgrade cost from glacial shroud).
0	Dude, I did the exact same thing!  Funny thing is, I know my wife uses reddit and now she might find out... She will be pissed.
1	Tried giving a tip once, will probably not attempt again.   We're about to win the game, and their 2-13 Heimer started complaining about all the slow my Rumble had. I simply suggested "Heimer, next time if you want try to build for a rylai's, it'll give you some nice slow"   His Response: "stfu I know how to play my champ blahblahblahblah" My Retort: "ok"
0	A yorkie showed up in my front yard.   I put up signs and checked with local vets and the police department, but noone came looking for him. At that point, they guessed him about 8-10 years old. When guesses put him at 14-16 years old, I had bonded with no animal in my life more profoundly than JD. The last couple years were a constant state of worry. It was when he started losing his teeth that I got worried. It was when he lost his first canine that I started panicing.   Unfortunately, my advise for current elderly dog owners would be, you'll know. Odds are it wont blindside you (well, it will, but not how you think). He was such a crazy, high energy, little thing that I figured he'd go out like a light bulb. One minute jumping around like he always did. Next stroked out dead.   Nope, one day he just decided he wasn't going to eat anymore. Being a yorkie (stubborn eaters), I had been through it and didn't cater to his denial for food for 3 days. Then I caved and got him a new brand hoping to get his attention. Then I tried going to the go to what got him eating when I first found him, lunch meat. After a week, I got desperate and got a baby syringe and started feeding him meat based baby foods.   I was unemployed at the time. It was horrible. I basically just laid with him and died with him. It was 2 or 3 weeks of spending my full days laying with him, trying to force feed him some baby food every 2 to 3 hours, watching him waste away, hoping as hard as I could that he would just eat something on his own again. It got to the point where he would get up and try to walk to his dog house, and would only be able to take a step or 2 before he collapsed. After this back and forth, him trying to get to his dog house, but not being able to make it, me picking him back up and bringing him back to the couch, I tried to feed him again and he immediately threw the food back up. It looked and sounded painful.   I had been wrestling with the thought, but that was the moment I thought "I need to call the vet". I couldn't compose myself enough to make the call, so my wife called a local mobile vet for us. I took him into his backyard, and he had a burst of energy (I think he knew) he hadn't had in weeks. Strong enough to walk half the length of the back yard to his favorite spot. He surveyed his yard from his favorite spot, hobbled back over to me, and collapsed on the ground. I picked him up, brought him back inside, and the vet arrived...   summation in the form of a
0	You will get over that. I am 23, never had an official GF, and am currently with an interested girl, though we are not in an official relationship yet. Our feelings are mutual, but we both agree this is not a good time for a relationship. We are both very busy college students, I am a student-teacher getting my license/degree, and she is studying nursing. We both want to commit when we both have the time that each other deserves to commit to each other.   Once in a while the thought of making an official commitment, especially with never having really done it before, scares me to death. What if someone else better is out there? I came to my sense a while back thanks to an article that I cannot remember the source osf at the moment. I am not aware of your religious persuasion, but I am a Christian, and an online article really did it for me.   The
0	I am going through this now. Its definitely not that we don't love each other. For me it seems to be a few things, a lot of stress at work, being exhausted as a result makes it actually unappealing to have sex; It's just so much work to make her happy, where 5 minutes and an internet connection is easy.  I wouldn't say she has 'let herself go' but she isn't the same girl as before figure wise and that plays some role, as well as a little bit of boredom and what i like to call "grass is greener syndrome". But ultimately 90% of the issue is me, I work in a pretty sedentary desk job and for the last couple of years have been really lazy, now I am blessed with good genes and high metabolism so looking at me you'd never know i sit on my ass 90% of my awake hours looking at a screen. But mentally I felt like shit, recently started hitting the gym again 3 times a week and the results have been awesome, sex life is returning and I even have her starting to want to get active and get her figure back.   Wow that got long
0	I put in 5 years at Office Depot as a part-timer.  The first 2 years were fine for me because I was still in school and part time was all I could handle.  After I got out of school I told them I wanted a full time position.  The boss said there were none available at the time, but he'd take care of me and promised I could get one after it becomes available.   Cut to 3 years later and I was still working part time there.  Looking back I should have left A LOT sooner than I did.  I had applied to a few jobs over the course of those 3 years, but never seriously sought after better employment thinking that Office Depot would surely hook me soon since I had been with them so long.   There was a small incident at work and tensions were high enough that it pushed me over the edge and I ended up quitting.  Sure, it wasn't the smartest thing to do considering I hadn't found another job, but I worked for Depot till I literally couldn't stand it a moment longer.   It turned out to be a blessing in disguise.  I began spreading out my resume and applications to lots of different places, but after speaking with management it wasn't looking too good for any of them.   After about a month out of work I was a day away from going to pizza hut because I knew they needed drivers.  I lucked out and got a call from a security company I had applied for.  They wanted to hire me to work a temp job for a power plant while it was in an outage phase.  The good news was that I was getting 60+ hours a week at a good payrate.  My first paycheck was 3-4 times what I had made in an entire month at office depot.   Things have been going so well with them that they decided to keep me and offered me a permanent job.

1	Another thing he said which really made me change my perception on losses: "The season is  really  long, like it's almost a year. You're in no rush".   This has led me to not care all too much about losses, and focus on improving my game in general. I realised that I can't win every single game, it's just not possible. So I focus on the next game and move on. Before anyone perceives this in the wrong way, I still care about winning - I just don't get frustrated if games go badly.   This is something everyone should be aware of. Having this mindset will make you pay more attention to improving, since you shift attention from getting frustrated. I.e. Instead of "fuuuuck I died crap crap crap, now i lose LP", it's more like "Hm, well we lost this teamfight, checking their dmg output is this I need to get this item, we should splitpush etc." Instead of having a destructive mindset you have a constructive one.
0	Please, karma is and account age is pointless.  I periodically start a new account.  Always cracks me up when someone tries to win an argument or support for his side by saying "account's only ## months old"  I was probably using Reddit more than a year before any one of these guys.
1	CLG will go 0-3 and liftlift will be replaced by Choax after the second game, with Hotshotgg moving from Top lane, to Mid lane, to ADC by the third game. Aphromoo will have plenty of presence in the lane by playing Leona in every game and continually feeding the ADC double kills only to have the ADC get blown up by season 3 strats left exposed by archaic season 2 mechanics from CLG. After the game BigFatLP will give an interview in which he officially announces that EG has returned as CLG.EU and the entire TPA lineup will be subbing for CLG.NA in the next week of the NA LCS. Meanwhile CLG's website will go down and come back up as a preview website for "The Next Big Thing in MOBA Gaming, Counter Intuitive Gaming" with a JPG of Xpeke's Kassadin backdooring for the win.
1	The more games you play then the variability of having bad teammates or even good teammates (luck of the draw) approaches zero and your skill will be the determining factor that shines through. It is the same way with poker and even sports.   Would you rather go a game to 21 with a pro basketball player for $100,000 or just 1 point? Obviously the 1 point as  anything  can happen in one point.   So if you play enough games then stuff like this becomes trivial and you will get through bronze because you are a good enough player not because you are getting carried or you can't make it because of silver V trolls.
1	Yes, there is already a solution for this problem. THE TRIBUNAL. It's very rare that anyone gets banned enough from bad games to make it to the tribunal and even more rare that the tribunal bans them. Keep in mind the people in the tribunal are the bottom like 10% of players so as "everyone" is reporting feeding games it evens out and not many of those feeders make it down there. And to those who do, I've found the tribunal is generally quite fair in their decision making. They aren't going to report someone just because they went negative but rather look at chat and build.
0	Do NOT do this. He spent  wayyyy  too long in the fatal funnel. Slice your pie as far back from your corner as is practical, roll out when necessary (but don't step and roll out), and EXPLODE through the doorway. Do not put your weapon in a "cover" mode (i.e. position sul, high ready, low ready), have it ready to shoot at a target in your blind spot (in this video, 90 degrees left) IMMEDIATELY.
0	Not crazy.  Absolutely not.   I grew up in rural Iowa and gun safety was taught in the home.   I was not allowed to point even toy guns at people as a little kid and was taught the safety rules for firearms before I was ten.   I have noticed a lot of "city" people in this country have absolutely no exposure to responsible gun culture.   Their only experience with firearms is the violence they see on TV.   So I do not think you are crazy for thinking someone should need some formal training to own a firearm.  We are crazy as a society for thinking the right to bear arms can be divorced from the responsibility to ensure that every citizen understands the basic safety rules of firearms handling.
1	Remember some of my games as xerath. i played him pretty ok for the first 30 matches. ok k/d. regular flash/ignite. nothing special. Then when i got better i decided to switch out ignite cause i usually wasnt in range for it anyways depending on the enemy mid pick. I picked tp - people flamed. I picked cleanse - people flamed. I picked barrier - people told me to use ignite. (in most of the games i were fed btw. or at least won my mid). Then i started using cv. Why not? My biggest problem were that the enemy junglers always ganked me and my map awarness was too bad so i took cause whenever it was up i could help my team with vision or simply know if the enemy jungler is coming to kill me and also i would learn to watch at my minimap more often. Used it 3 times. got 10/3 in like every game. Carried everygame. "Report Xerath for Troll Summoner Spells" at the end of every single game.
1	I just finished a game with trollpick trynd bot for adc, because he felt like it and "normal is for fun". In which universe fun is feeding the whole game and leaving the lane, so that other adc could get fed?   Am i mad? Yea, i am, because i play mostly normals, and i play them seriously - to win and learn the game, not to waste my time, because someone likes to "have fun". Do not play team games if you like that kind of play - go "have fun" in FPS or RTS games, where you can play 1v1, and when you want to lose intentionally, because you "feel" like playing that champ and when there's 99% chance that you will get outpicked, you can lose without annoying others.
1	I agree that people should be allowed to play what they want, but at least be competent, if you want to dick around with crappy champions, go do customs or bots, in normals you should at least be adequate with the champion you want to play, or else you are just bringing down the experience of the other people on your team. Despite that, sometimes people are just being tools, I was just in a game where I was duoqueueing bot with someone, and some other guys were duoqueueing too, and they wanted to double jungle, wouldn't listen to me when I told them it was a bad idea (three solos, less xp, etc etc). And eventually they only switched when I told them I was staying in a duo (I had already locked in thresh) so unless they wanted to leave top open all game they would switch. Regardless, they blamed me for every little thing, and would not join in teamfights all game. So yeah.
1	The main reason Amumu (and similar champs) faceroll bronze is that nobody knows how to recognize all but the hardest of initiations.  They win because they can actually start fights on out of position targets; for starters, in Bronze at least one person is out of position somewhere on the map at any given time, so you can always get your team fed.  As well, few people are dense enough to be eluded by "big mummy ult means I go in" when compared to less obvious spells.
1	Honestly, there is no such thing as a 'troll-pick'. What many, if not most of the League of Legends community does, is follow the meta; most players play with the set conventional play styles (e.g. 1, 1, 2 lanes, 2v1 lanes). What most people fail to realize is that the meta is not written in stone; there is no set way to play this game. Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but the meta is only designed to give you the best chance of winning the game. And the meta  changes . If people rage/flame at you for picking a bruiser bot-lane, remember that some (I can't remember who) pro players have predicted bruiser bot-lanes in the pre-season of Season 3. The OP is right, LoL is a game (obviously) and it is a sand-box type game, albeit 3 maps and limited options. Sand-box means that  everything  you do within the game is perfectly fine. However, this is only in the perspective of oneself. This game is a team game, so your game play should try and mesh with others'. But that's my own humble opinion.  My opinion is wrong, fuck me right?
1	Back when Evelyn just got a rework everyone was complaining that she was still terrible.   Well, I happened to watch some LoL tournament where a guy (Shooshie? Shushi? Some chubby white european guy with black hair) was claiming that she's an amazing mid. Well, he played Eve, and even though his team lost miserably, he consistently did decent with her despite the rest of his team getting destroyed.   So I buy her and try her out. Holy. Shit. She was AMAZING at mid! Literally every game I was stomping. Very easy to play, good farm, great ganks, tiny learning curve.   But every time people would throw a shitstorm at me for trying to go Eve mid. I'm a troll, I'm an idiot, I'm going to feed, no you're not allowed to pick her, etc.   Every game I had a ridiculously good record. Every mid was won, nearly all games were won because my ganks were so unfair. Yet every time I played with new people they'd give me the same grief.   So run whatever the hell you want. 99% of people will assume X champ is good/bad solely on how often they're played in pro tournaments. People don't realize, however, that they're picking based on team comps, counterpicks, the meta, etc, and most of this has little to no value to an average solo q player. And sometimes the pros don't realize something is good! Ezreal was untouched for like a year before "suddenly" he was overpowered and everyone played him.
1	He didn't just bring it back up after years of promising he would. When he did, he completely wiped out much of the database / forums containing private developer forums for heroes and items. Many of those champions are in League today (like Teemo.) He refused to acknowledge it even after many old DotA developers gave proof and simply said fuck you to the community again.   That's why people were pissed at him. He had stolen the ideas of many and even though he used them in his final game, he gave no credit to the people who created those ideas (something IceFrog or any other developer with respect to the community would do.)   Basically an example of the outrage from creators I am talking about:   infinitevox  >Oh thanks, THREE YEARS LATER. Oh well, now I can finally prove that I was the creator of: Teemo & Rammus > >And that your Dev team went through the DotA hero/ability/item suggestions and RAPED it for ideas for your game. Thanks so much for that. A little credit would have been nice, but instead you took the forums down so no one would know what you did, and even if they did know, they'd have no proof. > >Sad thing is, you were always nice to me. We'd play games with DevilsUrethra, ReposoEternal, GranDgrant, and a slew of other fun folks. Then you turned feral on us when you decided to make LoL. > >As petty as it may seem, some of us TDA and DotA1 Beta members know everything you actually did and have a long memory. There are a handful of us that know exactly how hard you really did try and screw Ice, and how hard you screwed us TDA/Beta members over. Now that we finally have access to the archives, we have the proof we need. > >Most people think you're a dick now, just wait till we start plastering the screenshots of the old forums where you plundered and pillaged our ideas and hard work for your game, and gave no credit or love back in return.   He took down one of the biggest gaming forums with a HUGE community (maybe more than this subreddit) just so he could have another source of inspiration just by grabbing whatever ideas other people had.
1	I only take issue in ranked, or if someone picks a champion for a role that doesn't fit. Jax support, Nami top, w/e. Certain champions have exceptionally low win rates, and that's where problems arise. I can't know if someone specializes in a champion, and that brings a risk to me when I'm committing my time and ratings to this game. I don't report if they do well, but I will report if in spite of them failing we win. That said, I do understand many people specialize in certain champions that may be alternative to the current meta (I recently played with a VERY good Shyvana, who had a 22-4 win rate with her), and I respect that, but I have to have some way of knowing that is the case.
1	that's hilarious bc i just played a game where i didn't ban malphite right bc everybody knows there are much higher priority bans. So this guy flames that i didn't ban malphite, then picks zed instead of an ap champ. then he proceeds to die to malphite and those are malph's only two kills in the whole game. meanwhile i go 8-2 as graves and rape malphite and the rest of his team. at the end of the game zed says he was the best on our team and hopes i learn to ban malphite bc he's so op.
1	This is a bit of human nature, because humans are narrow-minded. Most people especially on lower ELOs tend to just copy things they saw on stream and have a pretty straight mindset, which tells what is good and what is bad, how you have to play. Those people tend not to accept other oppinions that are out of the general consense. If you take a closer look you will see that in Real Life aswell. Especially regarding LoL in my oppinion there is no such things as Troll-Picks, of course there are things that wont work (e.g. if you try to play Karthus as an AD Carry), but even those very niche things might work if you catch enemies of guard. Most people just cannot accept something odd, that is not proven quite yet, because its just easier to stick to the usual stuff. Also people raging about odd Picks or even Bans (leaving Amumu open for example) will loose a lot more games than if they would just accept that someone wants to play something odd and probably even know what they are doing or just trying something entirely new. Best Example for this to me is Support Elise because hands-down after release of Elise people would have raged if you pick her up as Support and nowadays you see her at a really high niveau.
1	In normals you can play whatever you want but in ranked you better not be fp'ing that shaco or picking him into their tanky/aoe team. That is tantamount intentional feeding as your pick has made every teamfight a 4v5. Ranked is about winning and if you are not picking the champ that gives you the greatest chance to win you are doing it wrong.
1	LP gains are based on the MMR (elo) distance to next promotion series.   Player 1 @ Silver 1 has 1600 MMR, 70 LP.   Player 2 @ Silver 1 has 1500 MMR, 90 LP.   Gold 5 is 1550 MMR.   Player 1 wins a game and gains 30 LP -> enters series. He already had the MMR needed for promotion series so the system really wants him there.   Player 2 wins a game and gains 3 LP, is now at 1515 MMR of the 1550 needed for series. Distance to series 35 MMR, but only 7 LP. Next games will be worth the around the same 3 LP for wins. Losses can be like -15 LP, but it doesn't mean much.   The weak LP gains like player 2 has are common in division 1 of any league. That's because the MMR distance between leagues is greater than the distance between divisions within the league. Only at Diamond 1 the LP truly shows the distance to promotion series I think.
0	Adapting" is a much more objective approach than "being oneself" would be. As a person like OP, when I socialize with others I'll likely feel apathetic about everything they have to say, but I'll mimic enthusiasm/ interest/disdain/etc. to you know, fit in or whatever. Now I know everybody does this to an extent, but in my experience it has gotten to a point that I do this with everyone all the time, even my family. I'm well liked amongst many different cliques and social groups, but I don't feel close to anyone really. Every interest that I've developed over the years has been tailored to impress others, every mannerism artificial and changeable. Being a good liar really helps this too.
0	It's extremely hard to "be yourself" in situations and social groups that don't engage you. You may notice that the people who are extremely loud and obnoxious seem to have everyone flock to them, but it's mainly because they are basically throwing their arms in the air, exposing their personality to anyone willing to listen. It gives most people the sort of ice breaker he/she needs to find someone to gravitate to:  loud person (lets call this person Bill for simplicity's sake) Bill appreciates quiet person Sue (again, only for simplicity) because Sue is willing to listen and empathize with Bill; Sue appreciates Bill because Bill fills the void, makes the jokes laughs when Sue makes the occasional joke and is generally good company. While this works, if    Bill stays this goofball who keeps the spotlight firmly on himself and doesn't try to engage with Sue, then Sue will develop this hollow feeling because Bill is not letting her express herself and it will seem like any remark Bill says, Sue agrees with because Sue won't be showing any form of expression aside from embarrassment.  In the meantime, Sue cannot simply leave Bill to engage her because that is forcing Bill to combat a problem that is not being brought to his attention, denying this makes it worse three-fold AT MINIMUM. Wallflowers must voice their opinion as well, for complaining that no one engages them simply begs the question why they haven't engaged others: the answers will be strikingly similar.   This example happens in many different aspects, even family. A way to combat this tense nature: Sue invites Bill to things roughly as often as Bill invites Sue. By making Bill the guest and Sue the host, it gives Sue this established presence that she is the host, which welcomes Bill into her life, it gives Bill a chance to meet on Sue's terms instead of vice versa.
0	Amazing. I had that epiphany in High School. Now, I put myself first. I have to like myself, and don't compromise on that. It means I lose a lot of friends, but the ones who stay are great. I like "nerdy" things and embrace it. I'm a pseudo-intellectual. I enjoy mental math. I like cars, a lot. There are things I don't know, and that's okay.   It can be a problem though when I do things to entertain myself in public (like dancing when I'm bored) and my girlfriend is mortified because to her, social acceptance is  everything , but to me, I don't care. If moving like a goof makes me happy, I'll do it. And that's why I don't get dragged out shopping anymore.
0	It has nothing to do with boobs and everything to do with people being overly PC pussies. It's not just the pictures, I've seen NSFW tag on DISCUSSION threads. If you need to be told when a topic may not be appropriate for work, you will probably do some dumb-fuck move to get yourself fired anyway.   The real problem is reddit catering to the politically correct, easily offended culture. I am so goddamn tired of hearing how offensive something is, or how offended a group of people are; get right the fuck over it and move on and keep your bullshit to yourself. Being offended doesn't entitle you to anything and you should be treated like a whiny child since you are acting like one.
1	Swain enthusiast here, just dropping in to point out that Karthus E does more damage than Swain's ult (even on an optimal number of targets - 3 or less) coupled with the fact that without Karthus's passive Swain can't itemise for heavy AP like Karthus can.
1	As as an avid thresh player I approve this idea.
0	I think it's a great idea. After my last major breakup, I was in a borderline depressed state for months until I got my first dog. Although I do recommend adopting one that's at least a year or two old, possibly older. That way you're past the shit all over the house phase and more likely past the destroy all your shoes/furniture phase. Dogs are definitely a responsibility and in many aspects resemble having a human child, so get any big traveling out of the way first.
0	This sounds scarily familiar, shit. I watched all this girl's friends abandon her while she played the victim, acted like it was their fault she couldn't keep any friends, that she was the unfortunate soul in all of this. We were friends for years, even dated for a while, broke up on good terms, stayed close friends. I didn't realize just how badly she treated me.   One summer, she started talking about how much she hated her current boyfriend, how she was annoyed how much he was trying to contact her (they were home from college over the summer and couldn't see each other). She was ignoring his calls and bitching to me the whole time. This guy was the closest friend she'd had since me, he was a total doormat. When school started back up again she was suddenly buddy-buddy with him again because he was the only person who would tolerate her shit. I started to realize all her closest friends had the personality type that rolls over and takes shit without fighting back, and realized that included me. A few months later she was bitching to me about all her new college friends not agreeing with her on the tiniest things and talking about how they'd started to abandon her.   Ending that was the most liberating thing. I'd tried really hard to avoid it, to get her to understand, but  an emotional manipulator will always be one.  There's a fucking reason no one else would stay friends with her.
0	Congratulations!   I did this quite a while ago to a very close friend who I was living with at the time in a dorm room. She was very controlling toward me and the rest of our mutual friends. We fought often because I wouldn't take her unsolicited advice and wouldn't tell her all the details of my past or present.  She actually said to me that "we could no longer be friends if I wouldn't tell her everything." This was in regards to me hanging out with a guy from class and not being back in the room right away.   Finally there was just some ridiculous fight and I snapped. It was like someone turned off a light switch on caring about her at all. I just didn't care anymore. I did not give a fuck about her anymore and just stopped interacting. I didn't fight with her anymore, and I didn't go along with her ways of apologizing. I would simply say something like "No thank you" or "I'm busy."   Best decision I ever made. I was so much happier after I cut her out of my life.
1	wtf are you idiots trashtalking a nice person who tries to help some people that maybe actually want his help and even if theyre on the same level like u suggested they can still learn from each other so stop trashtalking nice   guys in the league of legends community
0	Professional appointments, job, and classes (25 y/o professional student) I manage to squeak by on time.  Just about everything else is up in they air and I view them as all having a thirty minute leeway for being late.   My rationale is that there aren't many social obligations where being on time matters unless plans are time contingent (eg, movie, going on a trip). Also, the people/groups that normally stress making it to something on time never offer repercussions for tardiness, everything always just continues as planned. Really stopped giving it much importance after I realized authority figures kind of just throw the word "mandatory" around for anything they want without much meaning behind it.   As for my few friends that are really anal about time, yeah it bugs them but it also allows for some balancing for both of us: I'm around to make sure they don't become anymore of a tight-ass and they keep me from becoming an even more irresponsible dick.   Balance.
1	As an avid thresh player I approve this skin.
0	It's because the banana with frosting looks like rediculously attractive/photogenic marathon runner pic that was on the front page a while ago. The hair was slicked and he was smiling, as I'm sure everyone imagines the banana to be doing with the frosting hair when imagining it as a person with eyes, and shit.
0	I just got done with one of these characters. I am not a touchy person and made this very clear from the beginning, but this guy insisted on hugging me every 5 minutes. So, that was the first thing that turned me off. The second was his femininity, this guy was just so damn nice. He agreed with everything I said, so it made it quite difficult to hold a conversation with him. I told him he was too nice, and he said "I'm sorry." We had sex and he couldn't stop thanking me, so much so that I started feeling extremely uncomfortable about having sex with him.   I finally get to the point where I decide that I just don't really like him and cannot put up with these conditions. I told him that I wasn't interested in him and let him know. He starts texting me all crazy saying he was going to come over and I don't text him back. Sure as shit, he came over. He knocked on my door and scared the hell out of me. I didn't think he was actually going to come over. So I tell him that he needs to leave because he was not invited here. It wasn't until I answered the door with my USMC NCO sword that he finally left.   Fast forward about a week later, I am hitting up my friends with benefits for a little [somethin' somethin']( and dude text me to see what I was up to. I got a text from the friends with benefits so I went to that one first. Somehow as I was typing my phone switched to the ex's text instead. My text that was a little NSFW got sent to my ex instead, who states that he was going to come over. I learned my lesson last time, so I told him that he needed to stay wherever he was at. Now he gets mad at me because I am talking to another person behind his back, after I had broken it off with him.   Finally got rid of him after about two weeks of plain ignoring him. So yeah, over attached boyfriends are out there, and they are just as crazy as women. I have had my fair share of overly attached girlfriends as well, they are equally as awful and I do not wish that upon my own worst enemy.
1	Guys- Regarding video vs. text:   More than likely Travis provided George the questions ahead of time, and let him take his time coming up with detailed answers; a video interview would have been great, but the answers we got would not have been as fully-developed / honest / truthful, and probably based more in emotion than fact.   HotShot's desire with this interview was to explain the decision and clear out concerns/questions fans might have. With a video interview, the answers are off-the-cuff / not as well-thought-out, so that might not have been possible.   Being able to able to step back and write out his responses let HotShot say what needed to be said in-full / as much as he can on the roster changes.
1	They're not always trying to abuse the system.   They just fall for silly scams.   Most people just assume that because someone on their friend-list sent them the link, it must be legit. Even though there have been people getting hacked and saying "i got sent this link from someone on my friend-list".   It's literally mainly down to people clicking links without reading them, or after they've opened the link they just glance at it, see it looks vaguely like the official LoL website and wants them to log-in, and then just try to login without even thinking about it.   Most people want an authenticator, because then it's there to wipe their ass for them so they don't have to bother thinking or paying attention.
0	That sounds wonderful. I'm not saying that you don't HAVE to spend a lot, since you obviously found it appropriate to find something beautiful for her, and you found it at a good price.
0	I agree.
1	This could be the greatest thing to ever happen to you.   You have so much talent when it comes to this game and, if you practice your face off, you could be a potential pro player or at least on a challenger team. However, all of the shit you have stirred up in the community over the past few months with the boosting, the bitching, and the questionable stream content has made a lot of people lose faith in you. Now, and rightly so, you are banned from playing this game on the aforementioned accounts.   Use this banning as a way to start fresh. Make a new account, get it to 30, buy some champs, and push diamond/challenger like you've done so many times. None of this is hard for you, and I think if you just started fresh and cleaned your reputation off a little bit on both streams and on forums, you could be a great addition to the community.
1	A lot of you guys seem to be hating on him for what he's done in the past, the thing is he payed his dues. He was banned, in fact he turned HIMSELF in. The point of being banned is to make "Even" for what you have done. With the "Proof" he has provided he seems to have been banned for no reason or for a reason that doesn't deserve as Perm ban. I get that he has done shit in the past, in fact I used to hate XJ9 (Also, most of the other boosters pissed me off too.) But he's apologized for doing that by turning himself in, took the punishment and moved on. His stream has changed from what I have seen, he seems to be a far less toxic person, isn't that the point of being banned is to make them less toxic. He's not a terrible person and I feel as though this ban was unjust.
1	Can you say, in an intellectually honest manner, that the only meaningful difference between TSM's wins and losses was their toplane choice?  And that the games they lost with Renekton and Yorick were truly the result of those picks and that the wins with Jayce and Shen were truly the result of those picks?   I don't know your numbers background, but I hope you have more than Stats 101 under your belt.  This is incredibly preposterous to attribute the differences to top lane without analysis of the other lanes.
0	While I agree with you completely that most of this is for Karma, it IS an important issue. And I think part of the problem with American politics is that shit like this happens and everybody just forgets about it a few months later. (For example, when HSBC admitted to having spent something like 7 billion dollars on funding drug cartels and anti-american organizations. A lot of people saw it. Nothing was done. ['MURICA!](   While I hate the commercializing of a serious political issue (even for fake internet points), this is something that Americans need to be thinking about daily. Americans should at some point in their day think "shit the NSA isn't respecting my privacy. I wonder if anything is being done about it?" That leads them to restorethefourth.org or /r/restorethefourth and gives them more people for the peaceful protests.
1	Hi-Jacking top comment to explain in case some people might not speak English as their first language or just don't get it:   The bus represents the game lobby, and the first poster says he's forced to make the decision: "Do I deal with this maniac actually trolling, and have to potentially spend 20 minutes ingame with this troll and lose the LP, or do i just dodge now and settle for -10 and the wait 30 mins for the next queue?". Riotpls fix this by letting people in lobby vote to kick certain people if they behave like this.   RiotYmir responds with:  Imagine you could vote whenever someone said "Mid or Feed" to kick them from lobby, and re-queue. This would start a cycle of "Nope. Kick him." Imagine going into lobby with a 3 man premade "You're first pick, but my buddy isn't getting ADC teemo? Vote." That's at least 3/4 votes against you already. Sure someone else in the lobby may want to play, but they can't (or won't) speak up, or the vote just jumps to them. No queue will ever go through, realistically there aren't that many sensible people in every game lobby. Most lobbies will just end with kicks, nobody will even get into a game. The chances of everyone getting the role they seek are so low, it's almost bound to never happen. The League will never be the same.   Super
1	I hate to be the guy that has to say it, but I believe that if this was ever implemented it would only ever work in Ranked matches.   It would never work in Normals.  Blind Pick/Draft, you can have more than two people queueing up together.  This makes it so they can troll whoever the fuck they want to troll in whatever way they can.  This can already cause problems for solo players because then the teamed up players can just mess with the solo player(s).   If this is implemented in a ranked queue, you have a max of two people queueing together.  With a max of one duo queue per team.  Meaning there are two people that may be playing together, and then three solo players.  Two people can't make a vote by themselves.  They have to convince at least one other person to go along with them.  And as long as somebody isn't being toxic, they have no worries.  The other players won't mob mentality that because there's only five of them total.  Mob mentality can't apply there.  Two people can't really start it happening in such a short amount of time.  And if the duo queue partners start being toxic about it, the other three have the power to veto them out of the game.  Which is important.
1	Picture it this way [ NA (3) + EU (3) = 6 ] & [ SEA (2) + China (2) + Korea (2) = 6 ] but then you add a extra team to korea which is why they have 3 now because of all-stars.   Hope that makes it have a little bit of sense.
1	I think they did this because else World's is going to be as predictable as the all-starts. Asian teams are at the moment just 100% better then the NA/EU scene. We have seen it countless time, and if we send equal amount of teams, then NA/EU will  NOT  have a chance at winning anything close to first place.
0	Protip: go to a thrift shop and get either a navy or charcoal suit. Black belt and shoes. Bam. Formal wear.  A dark blazer and match the pants as best you can if you must.   Provided you don't gain a lot of weight you can wear the damn thing forever.
0	I just wanted to say this is bullshit. Be real man.  I had to face a judge once and I dressed semi-formal, nice long sleeve collared shirt, dress pants and nice shoes. I wasn't about to wear my High school prom suit which is the only suit I have.  It was for a DUI/ fleeing the scene of an accident( no one was hurt though my car was fucked). They wanted to put me in jail but I, being young and Educated they seen promise. So they increased the fine and suspension date instead of jail time.
0	STORY TIME! In 2010, I was home from college for thanksgiving. I was driving back from my dad's workplace, and had taken the same road countless times. I was driving like a BOSS with only one hand on the steering wheel while blasting some Rick Ross on the radio. After driving for about 10 mins, I see a cop behind me with his police lights on. As a 22 year old who has never gotten a ticket I kept driving and changed lanes assuming he was after someone else. Few seconds later, I realized he was actually coming for me. So I pulled over. Out comes an obese, bald  white middle-aged officer with sunglasses on along and a dynamite mustache.   Officer: Boy, Do you have any idea how fast you were going? (this was kind of offensive because I am a brown guy in a southern state)   Me: No sir.   Officer: You were going 65 on a 35 zone son. (Oh he called me son! Memo: all cops are not racists)   Me: Really? I am so sorry I had no Idea.   Officer: I bet you are. License, registration, and proof of insurance please. (I give those to him and he goes to his car to write me a ticket)   Officer: So here is the deal, you were driving negligently, so here is a $496 ticket with six points on your drivers license. And here is your courtdate which is mandatory. If you dont come to court on this date, you will be considered a felon.   Officer leaves. My face starts flushing and as a college student, I realize I do not have 496 dollars in my bank account.   So I call my dad and tell him what had happened. Me: Dad I just got a 500 dollar ticket. Dad: how fast you were going. Me:...30 over. Dad: Okay, good luck. (Thanks, dad -_-)   Few days later, I go back to college for a couple of weeks. Here my friends give me all kinds of advise on what to do.   "bro just keep delaying your date"-I am too lazy to do this.   "bro just make up a lie on how you had to go home to get meds for your dad and that you completely froze when the cops stopped you"-hmm I could lie.   "bro just dont go to your courtdate"-yeah I have a few dumb friends.   But the only thing I was set on doing was what I had remembered from my Law Ed class that was taught by a defense attorney. Always wear a suit to court.  This is the easiest thing I could do and requires no thinking or plotting on my behalf   And So I came back home for my courtdate. I put on my black suit and went to the court early in the morning. I was nervous the entire time as I have never taken part in the judicial system. I go in, I take a seat, there are 3 other people before me awaiting their turn.  First person is some girl who is charged with abuse, or negligence. I cant remember. However,after her hearing, she calls the judge a dick and so he gets his cop buddies to escort her out but doesnt change his verdict. At this point, I am twice as nervous as this judge just had a terrible start to his day.   Second is a 16 year old in a hollister T-shirt and ripped jeans who is there for a speeding ticket. The cop who stopped him tells the judge that the kid was going 15 over speed limit.  Judge: How many years have you been driving? Kid: 6 months. Judge: You are to pay the full 200 dollar fine, and no points will be deducted.Thank you. (Okay I am screwed. This kid was going 15 over and no mercy was shown to him. I was going thirty fucking miles over the speed limit.)   Now its my turn. I get up as calmly as I can. My palms are sweaty (insert Eminem lyrics), I could feel that my shirt was drenched in sweat and the suit didnt help. So I go up to the podium.   Cop: Your honor, this gentleman was going 65 miles on 35 mile zone on North main street. I followed him for atleast half a mile before he decided to stop. (Damn this cop just fucked me over by speaking the god damn truth)   Judge: Is the true, son?   Me: yes.   Judge: How long have you been driving, son?   Me: 6 years, sir.   Judge: Do you pleady guilty to this charge? (Im screwed anyway. Its time to end this)   Me: Yes, sir.   Judge: I am reducing your fine to 25 dollars and giving you taking off 4 point.. If you take the safe driving course, your remaining two points will also go away. Are you okay with this, officer.   Officer: Yes your honor. (I love this GUY!)   Jude: Done.   I was speechless, I had no idea what had just happened. I went outside the courtroom to pay my fine of 25 dollars plus fees (total 95 dollars) and ran into the dad of the kid that went before me. Kid's Dad: I cant believe you got off with that. That some bullshit. I was too happy to argue with the dad and so I went on my way took the course a few days later which was 75 bucks and now had 0 pts on my license.   Later I found out that the road i was speeding on was changed from a 55 zone to 35 zone after the development of new houses in the area. This did not make me feel any better because I realized I could have hurt some kid playing in the area.   Moral: Do not drive like a maniac. Speak the  truth in the courtroom when it comes to speeding tickets .Be respectful to everyone there AND WEAR A GOD DAMN SUIT. And just because you live in the south, doesnt mean that all cops are gonna be racists.
1	Well to play devil's advocate, i will use an analogy with a cake. If i order a cake from bakery one and its perfect everywhere (like the frosting and the cake itself and the decorations are all perfect) then the cake is perfect. If i order a cake from bakery 2 and its terrible (just for the sake of the analogy), but the frosting is mediocre, then the frosting is the best part. Does that mean though, that just because the frosting on cake 2 is better than everything else about the cake that it's as good as cake 1's?
1	Here's something that took me 1,5 years to learn. Although you meet lots of players in game, you dont have to interact with all of them. You should mainly focus on your own mistakes and improving your play (which includes teamplay ofc). It's a choice to communicate with someone. You dont even have to mute people. You should just realise that you dont have to respond to chat. Especialy pre 30 it's not as important to win. Much rather you want to learn the game. So focus on learning the game, instead of trying to win. Make mistakes, try out stuff, learn from it, get better. This is also the case with games post 30, and ranked games.
1	While I was going to the post I was watching myself playing tons of teemo games just to get the icon and /flexing it to my friends that literally hates teemo which makes it funnier to play.
0	I wouldn't say they are the best, but they are perhaps the best in a reasonable price range. They are one of the nicest I've used, and are quite reasonable for their high quality sound. Most in-ears that are better cost substantially more, and that sort of money is better spent on Professional grade over-ears.
1	he just explained it?   I like comedy/action movies, you could like horror, someone else romance, etc. It's about personal preference. What I like is not necessarily something you like. I find PL funny and entertaining, doesn't mean you have to. He's just an entertainer, and you're entitled to not like his form of entertainment, just don't expect others to feel the same way you do (read: if you don't like his stuff, you don't have to bother looking at it).
1	Welcome to the world of journalism EVERYWHERE. When you "know" more than the average Joe on a subject, you'll always notice this trend from journalists, a mass amount of them don't do enough research into their subject (just look at the media's portrayal of what a "troll" is) and will get a lot of things wrong, but most people just don't know enough themselves to call them out on it.   Even the majority of "news" nowadays is scavenged from places like Reddit and so forth.
0	I live in a state that does. I'm a firefighter myself, and was talking to a police officer who was offering cover to a neighboring departments medic unit (he was riding back to district with them in the medic unit). A vehicle failed to yield while they were going code 3 (lights and sirens) to another call, to which they got disregarded, and decided to pull behind this guy who finally yielded and the cop jumped out and gave him a ticket. Funniest shit ever.
1	I first played Malzahar and that was some time after he had been released apparently. I ended up building mejay's soulstealer and I started calling him a pancake man cause you could trap people on top of the void (w). I really liked the champ back then. It was nice to get started with him.
1	Quick question.   That "may be cropped" business with the red border: How "may" is may? Is it always cropped? Usually? Sometimes? I used that Diana/Leona art that IronStylus posted not that long ago and since it's already halved, the edge of the image needed to lined up right with that red border.
0	It's probably your fault. Bad braking habits is what causes people to do this.   I am this passenger, but I only do it for two specific drivers. My wife and my brother.   My sister, best friend, and other friend don't get this from me. They know how to brake early and correctly, and they don't constantly "push" the people ahead of them.   If I am a passenger, and there is plenty of room in front and behind us, the three good drivers I mentioned always create as much space in front and behind us as they can. My wife and brother will proceed to push ahead and close the gap with the car in front. They might not ride right up on their ass, but they still unnecessarily get closer to a car despite there being plenty of room on the road.   The wife and brother also start to brake about 2 seconds after I have thought "they should be braking". The three good drivers brake at the same time or before I am thinking it.   Maybe I am being a shitty passenger, but I don't think so, being that there are plenty of drivers that don't make me brace at all.
1	So, how do you go about being a support main and enjoy it? I'm by no means a good support, but I'm working on it because I don't wanna be that guy in ranked that "can't support." However, as a dude that likes to play Top and ADC, I'm used to action and big numbers so I find myself getting pretty bored with zoning and warding.   Are there any champs you would recommend giving a try to maybe spark some interest in the role? I usually play Leona (5-1 in ranked so far) and do enjoy her all-in playstyle, but lately I've run into some pretty nasty, high damage poke supports that cut me down to half health before I even get a chance to land a zenith blade. I've played a couple fiddle games and liked it, but it feels like you need an ADC (and team) that is capable of taking advantage of your fears and reliably turning them into kills.
1	One thing I've not seen is the option of Augment Gravity giving 200 mana, 10% CDR, 5 mana/5, and a 30% increase to cast range on Gravity Field. Yes your Death Ray does less damage but having better CDR, better pick potential and quicker spells makes up for it IMO.
1	Before you judge my comment, Ninfang is a great buddy of mine and I respect everything he does and how he plays Rengar.   But this play has nothing special to it. He takes his jungler's red which gives him a crazy advantage (insta level 2, rengars prime cheese moment) and on top of that starts with a red pot. A fiddle running into a brush where Rengar is located isn't going to be pretty business. The fiddle wasn't even ranked in Soloq and the graves was diamond 1 (5 points). After the fiddle feeds him first blood it was going to be an easy clean up on the graves since he had red to chase him out.   Once you get that big of an advantage on someone with Rengar there is no hope for you. Pretty much sums this game up as the rest was just fiddle having no clue how to play against rengar and Ninfang just being way better than him.
1	I believe it's all to do with confidence when they verse the smaller teams they have the mentality that they will crush and win but when they verse other teams they get into the mentality that they will lose and get stomped so they play re actively instead of pro-actively.
0	I'll probably get internet punched in the taint for what I'm about to write but I guess that's just what comes with being on the internet.   Sometimes you love someone. That person you love is a beautiful flower, you water that flower every damn day for the first 6 months or so. Then the flower gets weeds growing with it. Goddamn weeds. So you pull those weeds and the flower is no longer surrounded by the ugliness and all you see is its pure beauty once again. But guess what, those weeds, those mother fuckers come back. Seems you didn't get their roots, shoulda dug deeper. But maybe you thought that if you got the ugliness on the surface to disappear then everything would be fine. You were wrong. You were so very wrong.   You see this flower is still beautiful and you continue to water it, just not every day, maybe a couple times a week. Sometimes the flower doesn’t want you to water it. Sometimes the flower gets upset that you want more to just water it than to pull the weeds. But it's so much easier to just water it and let the weeds deal with themselves. The flower starts to close its pedals. You try to get them to open back up and they do, but then they close again. While that flower is still beautiful to you it makes you sad that the flower no longer wants you to water it and to be the one to take care of it.   The weeds come back. This time you spray weed killer on them and pull them from the ground. Fuck, you didn’t get deep enough again for those damn roots. Or maybe you did. Unfortunately the roots have already damaged your flower. Even though you got to them it was too late. The damage was done. Your flower is dying. You try everything. Water, miracle grow, more sun light, anything you can think of. You talk to it, wonder what is going on in the flowers’ head but you can’t seem to bring the flower back to how radiant and happy it was when you first started watering it. Yet in your eyes that flower is just as beautiful as the day you first layed eyes on it. You still love that flower, so very much.   The flower closes up again. It starts blaming you for why it’s not the same anymore, why she doesn’t want you to water her anymore. But you have been watering this flower for three and a half years and she wants you to still care for her. But her roots are damaged and you can’t fix them. When it’s cloudy the flower really gets upset, somehow the clouds are your fault but you have no idea how or what you did to make it your fault. Clouds, weeds, pests eating her pedals, too much water, not enough water; these are all your fault.   You don’t know how to fix things. You are so fucking sad because every other flower you watered up until this point has died. You must hold on you tell yourself. Maybe if you get out of your garden and just take a look at other gardens that won’t hurt. Afterall your flower got so upset and refuses to talk with you and tells you that she doesn’t want you to water her anymore. This has happened a few times before but it always seems that you make things better after a few days and things will blow over like before. You’re outlook is slightly different this time because the flower said some very hurtful things. You’ve kept things inside for too long and let them build up.   You decide to take a walk with a friend that night. He leads you to a garden full of beautiful flowers. All kinds. There are roses, tulips, lilies, daisies, orchids…it’s been a while since you watered orchids. One rose in particular would love to be watered by you. She listens to your problems with your flower at home. How your flower doesn’t like the way you water her. How she doesn’t like your muddy boots, doesn’t care for the way you sing to her. But this rose loves all those things and thinks that you are an amazing gardener. So you stay up all night with this rose and talk and laugh and after many drinks you water this rose.   Feelings of immediate regret and self-loathing serge through your veins and take over your body. You run from that garden. As fast as you can. Why would you do that? How could you water another flower? You weep. Your body convulses with shame and sadness. You go home to your garden, not sure of what to do. You don’t want to hurt the flower that you have loved for three plus years. So you don’t tell her what happened. But things are different. You don’t try and water your flower for weeks. You can’t sleep. You can’t look at the person that’s in the mirror. You lose 10 pounds cause you can’t eat. Then one day you can’t take it anymore and you sit down next to your flower and tell her what you did. You see the look in her eyes when you tell her that you watered another flower that was not her. That look will be forever burned into your memory and every time you think of her you picture that look of heartbreak in her eyes. It breaks you apart inside, and forever will.   The flower dies. At least the relationship you had with her. You leave. Nothing more to give. You don’t deserve to have watered such a beautiful flower.   I started out writing this to justify a very few certain circumstances where cheating isn’t as one sided and horrible. But in writing this I remember how fucking shitty and what bullshit unfaithfulness is. Some people say that the worst feeling is being cheated on. They haven’t experienced the pain of looking someone that you love in the eyes and telling them of your infidelities. Now some people say if you really loved someone you wouldn’t have cheated. Sometimes people are weak. Sometimes they can be spiteful. Sometimes they let too much shit build up and don’t address underlying issues. Sometimes you do shit and regret it and hate yourself for it. Sometimes it’s something that you regret for the rest of your entire life.
0	Color blind redditor here.   I have a girlfriend and am too old to fall for such a stupid meme, but the question I have is about: what does this have to do with being color blind?  Am I missing a part of the meme that is hidden from my vision?
0	You really have no idea what is going on in the US, do you?   In short form:  about 4 years ago a law called the ACA (affordable care act) was passed, it was later ruled constitutional by the Supreme Court, and hence is a valid law.  It requires all people in the US to buy insurance or face a penalty from the government.  The law will be coming into full effect on Jan 1st 2014 for individuals, right now congress, specifically the House of Representatives is attempting to add a delay to it (they originally tried to add a complete repeal of the law) as a rider to the budget they are passing.  The Senate refuses to pass the budget as a result of this, which has caused the previous budget to lapse without a replacement, causing all non essential federal programs to shut down until a budget is passed.   This has NOTHING to do with the debt ceiling, which is tackled separately.
0	Today, 80% of music is absolutely atrocious. It is computer enhanced garbage and many love it and there's nothing wrong with that because that's what they like. But that being said there is a solid 20% of modern music that is so stunningly amazing it can be life changing. It's not just one type of music it's in every genre across the board! For example I hate dub step/house music, but dammit there is some out there that is just remarkable and I respect.
1	Sigh.. not sure why Fizz should be nerfed out of the big 4 assasins. He is the only one that CANNOT farm from ranged. His ranged abilities when used to farm put him into melee range of creeps, so that cannot be used as a counter argument to the fact that fizz cannot farm from ranged.   The same thing that happened to Twisted Fate is going to happen to fizz. Like Twisted Fate, there are many counters to Fizz. Ever tried playing against a Malzahar as fizz? RIP. Diana does extremely well against fizz too. The only thing is, rarely are these champions picked against fizz. just like Twisted Fates counters at his time of greatness, no one thought to counter pick TF and then he got nerfed, and to top that off the sudden rise of his 2 worst nightmares, fizz and ahri have completely ruled him out of competitive play.
1	You just said good and bad players play Champion A. So the second factor is dead even. 1/1.   This is a false assumption. You're assuming equal numbers of good and bad players play Champion A, which is not something you can assume, especially given that most of the playerbase is not what you would call "good". Particularly on higher skillfloor champions like Zed.   The second problem is that certain champions (like Zed) have higher skillcaps to go with their higher skillfloor (aka learning curve), so really pro players can do amazing things with them. Cool, so far, so good. However, the bad players see the good players doing awesome things and think they can do that as well. Then they lose.   So a champion can be really good and still garner lower winrates because said champion is only good in the hands of someone with skill, and there are vastly more people without skill than people with skill.   For a clear math example, let's break from reality for a second here and say that I'm Diamond 1 and thus considered a "good" player. For every diamond player there are at least 10 bronze-silver noobs who will play the same champion, particularly if said champion is considered "OP" because their kit is strong. So unless I'm playing the same number of games as 10 bronze/silver noobs (which would probably necessitate playing nearly 10 times the amount of games I would normally), odds are good that the bronze/silver noobs will bring the winrate of that champion down.   And that's assuming I win every game, which I most likely won't.
1	The problem is Chaox mostly has fun at other peoples expense. He's always laughing at someone or ridiculing someone. It makes a lot of us uneasy.
1	The fight was Nice, but you actually used a way to edit that i've always loved so far (with the bot voice) and Turned it into a god awful clip.
1	It's not necessary a problem with clamping.   An interesting effect of Riot's promo system is if you win a lot starting from a lower division (e.g. from Silver V-III then win all the way to Silver I). Because of the wins, your MMR becomes gold-level. However, because the system won't let you just go to gold, you still have to go through promotions multiple times.   This creates a problem if you are in Silver I with Gold III-II MMR. Instead of needing to win 3/5 games vs Silver I MMR teams (which any Gold III-II should be able to do), you need to win 3/5 agsint gold III-II, which is much harder! all while losing LP on losses despite having much higher MMR than their division.

0	Howdy! Getting into games is a fairly simple process! If you have a desktop computer that was made in the last 5 years, I can recommend a fairly popular puzzle game called portal! It is a breeze to pick up and play, and it is challenging enough towards the end to give you a sense of accomplishment. If you dont have a computer that can run it, I recommend picking up a earlier console called an N64. it was made by Nintendo entertainment in the 1990's and many of the games it has are iconic, cheap, and great party games (Mario kart 64 springs to mind) Even though it is dated, they are still pretty ubiquitous and very easy to find if you know where to look! A beautiful journey awaits you and your SO will be very surprised!
0	Then you'd probably have more fun with a Zelda game (they're awesome). First person shooters (for the most part) probably won't be your thing. Most Blizzard games are also war/fighting-related, though with very different mechanics. If it's the war, gore, violence, whatever that doesn't resonate with you then you probably won't enjoy those either.
1	I've gotten to gold 4 with the vast majority of my games being karma either top or mid. You have 3 ults that do 3 different things. If you play like one is the best that should be used all the time and another is the worst and should never be used, you aren't playing her right. Each bonus has it's own ideal situations that it should be used in. When sieging and trying to poke from afar, your mantra'd Q along with a self shield to get yourself into position, and you start widdling down their health bars. Once a fight breaks out, you have your options open to how you want to play out the battle. Mantra Q will give you the best shot at nuking one of their squishies, and the slow can open up opportunities for your teammates to move on them. Mantra W is great for when one enemy is seperated from their team and you want to have a 1v1 duel with them, the damage is not to be underestimated, mantra'd W will always deal more damage than getting just the first proc of mantra Q, only the combined two mantra Q procs will add up to being more damage than a full mantra W. The heal is incredible for baiting, either under turret or engaging on the enemy laner that is trying to finish you but has no more cooldowns or tools to use on you. Mantra E really shines in teamfights, if you wanna to sit back and play the role of crazy fed support, karma does it well - sit right next to your AD carry and keep your shield on them as much as possible. When a tank comes to get at them you can easily peel them off with your slow and your root. With enough CDR and AP they won't be able to get through to the carries you are protecting.
0	The boy is happy to eat a hamburger.  He dreams about making the hamburger.  But he knows he has to do good in school.  As he concentrates on his schoolwork, the vision or reality of the dream sadly slips away.  In the end, even though he is a "succesful astronaut," he is sad because he just wants to be the burger flipper.
0	Basicly, the comic is saying that the world makes jobs like flipping burgers look so bad and only the "stupid" people do it. We don't allow people to follow  their  dreams and become whatever  they  want to be. Instead, we force them to go higher, even if their dream job is flipping burgers.
0	They told us growing up we could anything we wanted, an astronaut and President were their favorite examples. I'm 6'5 and foreign, so I can be neither.
0	Because "education" has become a self-serving industry driven by the standards of people who never left academia. Of course they think these things are great career choices; they don't have a clue what people in the labor market want.   On top of that, now that everyone thinks they have to go to college, banks and governments have created programs that allow anyone access to cheap (ish) loans or free money. This, in turn, causes the cost of education to inflate. A good parallel would be the housing bubble. The problem was that anyone could get a loan without any evidence they could ever pay it back. What happens when people can get $1mil loan with no down payment or proof of income? Housing goes to insanely inflated prices that make no sense, the bubble finally bursts, everyone in these programs loses their house. Eventually the "education bubble" in the US is going to have to burst, but until it does, we are going to continue to see rising tuition prices, bigger student loans, more people making their money entirely from academia, and bigger regrets from the people who made bad choices based on bad data given to them by people who are "more knowledgeable".   Plus, we are going to see continued vilification of laborers. Fast food workers, farm hands, welders, construction workers, all of them are going to get an even worse image than they already have. Then, unemployment will be even worse, because people won't want to take jobs that they "went to college to avoid". It is no wonder teens (in my area at least) avoid trades like the plague. In high school we were told that we need to get in to a "good college", which meant expensive college. When my wife told her English teacher what school she wanted to go to, the teacher said, "You know you can get in to a legitimate school, right?" Yes. Never mind that this particular university has one of the top programs in the nation for her major. Let's go to one with a more "prestigious" name that has 4x the tuition cost plus higher cost of living.   Wow. That turned into a rant. Sorry.
0	Yup, I work harder than all my coworkers and now i'm stuck having to work  2 extra hours once a week (No over time pay) so i can take out trash and mop the floors. Solely because I'm the only employee(in my position) that  occasionally   help at the end of a shift because everyone else would leave ASAP to avoid helping.
0	You should have let a cart accidentally hit his car.   I never really got along with school, after I graduated I kind of just sat around and played MMO's till my dad got sick and passed. Found a job handful of months later at a retail store, everyone bugged me with "Are you in college? Why not?". It was pretty annoying to be badgered by random customers about it. 2 years later I am the manager of the same store(no prior work experience besides pushing carts) and my DM talks highly of me.
0	I went to Uiversity for 5 years and got 2 degrees. A friend offered me a job doing road works when I graduated while I looked for something in my field so I took that. Was doing the stop/go sign outside a school where we were working and people would always make jokes about what qualification I needed etc (mostly light-hearted jokes but still pissed me right the fuck off). Took great pleasure in telling them infront of their kids that I went to University and would up a road worker so I should have just gone straight into that line of work after high school. They all tried to hurry off before little Jimmy or Sally got bad ideas about doing physical work.
0	Yeah, I worked as a maid at a high end resort and had these horrible guests say the same thing to me and a fellow employee. Both of us are working on masters degrees and worked there to pay the bills. Our boss was out in the hallway and told us to stop cleaning up her spilled bath water, said some curt, but truthfully things to the woman and we all left. The guest complained, but the resort values their employees so much that they asked the guests to leave. It was very rewarding,
0	Happened when I was younger, but have a read.   Round 1 Working at a Walmart at 18 as a stocker in groceries, I knew where a thing or two was located. An older woman came up to me and asked if I knew where a certain item was, lemon juice I think, so I answered with it location, aisle 5 top shelf above the tomato juice and v8. Her reply was that she was just there and it's not where I said it was, so I walked her over. To which she said somebody just stocked it so she missed it.   Round 2 Some old lady, same question, different item.  I gave her the answer, but this time she didn't believe me and asked for a manager. Ok, whatever, I spot my manager cruising , so I flag him down. Tell him the lady had a problem with me, but she wants ITEM and its located at LOCATION. Tells me not to worth about it and off he goes.   Round 3! An hour or so later, here she is again. She sees me and starts to ask me the same question of another item, but this time she sees and older worker behind me cleaning some shelves. Flat out tells me she sees a more experienced worker so she'll just ask them instead. I watched her walk over to the "More experienced" worker, ask the same question and to my surprise they walk back to me.   "Hey NerdxRage, this woman is looking for Cheese cake mix, do you know where it is?"   "Yes  I do, it's at aisle 7 above the sugar past the marshmallows."   "See I knew you knew where it was, I just don't know why she wasted my time by refusing your help the first time," and she made sure the old lady heard her.   One of the annoying things about customer service. I'm young, have shaggy hair, and don't have a smooth shaved face. But I do my job, do it right, and do it good.
0	So instead of a non paid day...you're using your vacation days. You do realize at most jobs you can just ask them to do this for you.  Vacation is just PTO, use it how you feel.
0	Confront the possibility (and the thoughts) that it could all go wrong with the fact that it could go right.   I understand that dealing with people is a difficult, complex thing and sometimes people and situations demand things of you that you may not be prepared to give, but I urge you to try.   I think it most effective to simply surrender to your own hope and innocence; to aim for the best possible outcome. If you fail somewhere along the way, stay humble and honest. Do your very best to identify the SOURCE of whatever problem you may have, and respond effectively - without shame.   You are who you are, broken or damaged though you may be, because of a number of things that are far beyond your control and because of some things that are. Try to identify them all. Study them. Try to figure out what you need most and see if you can find a way to combine those "ingredients", those factors, in such a way that you maximize personal and mutual/communal benefit.   If you need a break but can't afford a vacation, search for an unexplored place nearby OR  within . I find that simply laying down and taking a second to enjoy it is better than many of the things that I've paid a notable amount of money for.   I'm a bit off-track but feel free to ask anything that comes to mind. We're all on the same journey.
1	Your LP gains and losses in ranked are determined by your MMR compared to what MMR is expected for someone in your tier/division.   EFT = Expected MMR for your tier/division   MMR < EFT --> LP gains < LP losses. The system thinks you should be in a lower division/tier.   MMR = EFT --> LP gains ~= LP losses. The system thinks you are roughly where you belong.   MMR > EFT --> LP gains > LP losses. The system thinks you should be in a higher division/tier.   Furthermore, in division 1 of any tier LP gains/losses are also affected by clamping. Clamping stunts your LP gains/losses. Clamping gets more severe the closer you get to your promotion. It is possible to gain +0 LP for a win if you are at ~99 LP and your MMR is insufficient for the next tier. For more information on clamping please read [this]( post.   Additionally, your LP gains and losses are also affected by the average MMR of your team compared to the average MMR of the enemy team.   For more information about the league system read the [Season 3 FAQ](   For more information about MMR read [this](
0	Really interesting analysis on leaf blowers in Freakanomics. The usage of a leaf blower is a socially unsustainable activity. Unless you gather them up, you're only ever moving the problem somewhere else. The only reason they work is because not everyone is using them. If everyone (including city street clearing) used them, the leaves would just be constantly moved around, and no-ones yard would be clean.
0	For as long as I can remember my mom has had a feud with our neighbor.  To this day we are not sure who started it.  My mom swears she saw him tossing his golden retrievers shit over the fence into our yard.   He claims it was her (Which is weird cause I was the one on Poo duty). This went on for a few years.   It all culminated one day,  she was working in her garden next to the fence and next thing she knows poo just starts raining over her.  She freaks out and starts yelling at him and throwing a pile of compost back.  They start fighting and he gets his hose and starts spraying her.  Finally they both come to their sense and realize they are having poop fight and go inside.  To this day they have never spoken about it.  I won in the end tho.  Took his youngest daughter's virginity on his water bed.
0	Why drive at all?   To get from A - B quicker than normal? To avoid the use of public transport? Convenience? It's your job? Physically impaired to walk? Because you enjoy driving? The list goes on   Yes you're right, some people should never drive sober, but two wrongs don't make a right. Yes, it's not heinous to drive under influence but you are making yourself less able than normal... why? What benefit is there? When doing things that risk lives, why would you ever, ever, not take every precaution you can to ensure you don't manage to kill others or yourself?
0	I agree so much with your statement.   I was walking to the bus one day and was crossing a small intersection when this little pickup truck stopped right in the middle of his left turn. I thought he was going to ask me for directions or something, but he started rambling to me about this pizza place a few blocks away and that if I ever needed to take a date anywhere that it was a great place to do that, and it's never very busy because of the location, but I shouldn't get the pasta, just the pizza. I ended up having to just walk away because he wouldn't stop talking and I was going to be late for work. This experience really scared me because I hadn't really thought about the fact that people who were obviously mentally unstable would be able to get their driver's license. Or that the people doing the driving tests would overlook someones mental instability and allow them to have a license.
0	I'll agree to disagree.   Just think about it this way; Mentally handicapped programs are good, but not all mentally handicapped people will get anything good from them. Because not all mentally handicapped people have the same handicap, they are all different, and unique in the way that they learn.   This is the same as any other situation with any other group of people. Every person is different, no program can honestly absolutely cover every single person, but the fact that the program exists is a good thing.
0	generally speaking if a teacher is dealing with children who are that severely handicapped they are specially trained this generally includes at minimum basic first aid but often the training goes further. Generally these aren't normal teachers in classrooms with these types of students (that only happens at severely underfunded districts which brings a whole new set of problems) these are teachers who've chosen to go into this niche field of special education....   To me the revision sounds like we need nurses looking after these not teachers... but when you consider specialized training these teachers get and that generally this is their chosen field you start to get into a game of semantics. If someone can perform the basic functions of a nurse and teacher (bear in mind teaching in these cases usually has more to do with helping develop coping mechanisms and learning how to communicate on any basic level) what does it matter if I call them a teacher? I don't think you sound cold-hearted, I just think you haven't really thought the issue through... unless you're voting to just kill or neglect handicapped people which in that case you can go fuck yourself, but I don't think that's the argument you're making.   My point about all the other issues is not that this is the place to discuss them, but that they all should be dealt with before the issue brought up can be thoroughly examined. So what makes a productive member of society? someone who works at a factory? is productivity in society based on a paycheck? what is productivity in society based on? if we are going to determine that then we should consider the function of society. what is the function of society? is it to consume? to produce goods? help people?   My point being how can you measure any individual as a "productive member of society" without understanding what productivity in society is and you can't begin to understand the answer to that question without understanding what the function of society is.   All of this and we haven't touched on measuring the value of a person which is at the root what this post is about...
0	I'm really astonished how out of place the phrase 'contributing to society' gets used. Contribution to society is an obligation that should be fulfilled according to one's wealth and abilities and is in no way a measurement of 'goodness' of a person.   It's not like you are contributing more to society just because you have more money or do more voluntary work. Everyone is obligated to do his share. You're doing more? Enjoy your karma, have my thanks and my admiration. What you're doing is a gift to society, and I wish there'd be more people like you.   You're doing more and feel entitled because of it? Suddenly, that's a bit like 'I gave you that nice necklace for christmas, so you have to blow me' in my ears. Know what? Blow yourself, then. Gifts are a sign of appreciation, not a way to buy friends.
0	Close.  "If you find a man seeking only the affection of those who are great, depend upon it he is ambitious and self-seeking; but when you observe that a man seeks the affection of those who can do nothing for him, but for whom he must do everything, you know that he is not seeking himself, but that pure benevolence sways his heart."     Charles Spurgeon

Cows and sheep have very dense muscle tissue, dense enough that the bacteria you generally find on steaks and lamb can't quickly migrate very far into the meat, they just live on the surface. Over time the bacteria can eat through it and make it go rotten, but unless your cow was horribly sick or your steak has been left out for a few days, heating the very surface of the steak above 160 degrees Fahrenheit (344.26 Kelvin) is enough to kill any dangerous pathogens. This really has little to do with regulations; it's not challenging to keep the interior of a steak relatively bacteria-free.   Burgers throw this rule out the window, because they're made of ground beef. Grinding up the meat moves all the surface bacteria around, permeating the entire burger. That's where meat industry regulations come in, hopefully ensuring that you won't get sick eating a medium-rare burger, even though you didn't cook it enough to kill all the bacteria at the center.   With chicken and turkey, the muscle tissue isn't dense enough to prevent the spread of bacteria, and a large percentage of commercially-bought chicken and turkey meat has salmonella on it, which permeates all of the meat, so you have to cook it all the way through.   Pork can contain Trichinella spiralis, the roundworm that causes trichinosis, which can be fatal. T. spiralis dies at ~150 degrees Fahrenheit (338.71 Kelvin), so even questionable pork is going to be safe if you cook it all the way through. People still get trichinosis from eating undercooked wild boar here, but the regulations are good enough that it's safe to eat medium cooked commercially-bought pork.
0	I tried to find the clip, but couldn't... My favorite episode of Grey's Anatomy (I don't watch anymore) features a cameo by Faye Dunaway as the aging Dr. Campbell who refuses to admit she's become obsolete.  Her excellent bedside manner and years of experience with her return patients allows her to explain away routine mistakes as "complications". I haven't seen the episode in forever, but I think she does a gall-bladder operation by hand when newer, laproscopic procedures (which she refuses to learn, because of the  back in my day  bullshit discourse) could have done the job much better.  Toward the end of the episode, after Dr. Yang (Sandra Oh) embarrasses her in front of the interns during a surgery she has a Oscar-worthy meltdown screaming "THIS IS STILL MY O.R!!!! OUT! EVERYONE OUT!!!"  Then they fire her.

He is no longer a Health Care Professional, and has been retired for 2 decades. He is from the 'old school' of medicine. You know, where women were pretty little things in uniforms, and were laughed at for being considered able to go higher than nurse. Ambulance men, were just taxi drivers, with a stretcher to scrape people up, and nurses were just the arse-wipers, and gophers. He has not had a clinical update in 30-40 years.   His 'tests' for me would be stuff that we would see every day.   An example:   UNCLE:- You are called to a man in the road; he is seemingly unconscious. What do you do? ME:- Well, check for danger, try and get a response from verbal, then pain stimuli, then assess his ABC's.  UNCLE:- Ah, yes, but then you notice an empty bottle. Now what do you do? ME:- Assume it must be Friday night, and I must be in a town in the UK, but not rule out medical or trauma causes. So get a blood sugar, take other observations, such as pulse, BP, oxygen saturations, and do a full secondary survey, to assess for trauma, from the head down. In the event of no obvious cause, and irreversibility with anti-opioids, transfer to the appropriate A&E dept at hospital, depending on if there is stroke, cardiac or trauma as a potential cause. (in the UK there are specialist treatment centres for these things).   At this point my uncle, would usually try and go to a depth of medical knowledge that would be beyond me, but fail, because his knowledge has diminished, and he thinks I am just an ambulance driver. Which I am not - I drive a car.   I don't pretend to know everything, and there is an enormous gap between General Practitioner, or in fact ANY medical doctor, and a Paramedic, There is no disputing this, and I would not even try. But my uncle is not a GP any more, and has not been for some time. He would not be able to cut it in the modern world of medicine. He is quite patronising, and also rather condescending with his manor, as I imagine he has always been to his staff, and patients, because that is how a lot of them were in the "good ol' days".

0	serve you something that doesn't reflect their art/skills   'Fuck what you want, I'm an artist!'?   That is ridiculous.  I have a colleague who is the CEO of a billion dollar a year company.  Like me, he has issues with textures.   Rare steak makes him throw up.   An oh so clever chef pulled the 'You ordered medium well, so I'll deliver completely rare' thing.  A table of 20 people, who ended up spending about $7,000, ended up at a different restaurant.
0	Rule #1: Just because you are a male, does not mean you need constant "coaching" at cooking. Especially if you are a professional chef. It's also not "cute" when a male is trying to cook, and obviously has the right experience and knowledge...   Rule #2: Do not assume you are better at cooking from other people just because you have been cooking for a long while. There is a huge difference between a cook and a chef.
0	people have been ignoring your order and deceiving you.   How fucked up is it that they can't be bothered to tell you how they  actually  cooked your meal after you've enjoyed it. If well done is that bad, and my order was ignored and made medium well, I'd like to fucking know so next time I know what to order and don't look like an asshole.
0	I find this truly an interesting test of a persons financial status growing up. It is usually also a indication of the class of person, not always. Seeing someone request a steak anything above medium rare seems that they have never had a good steak or one prepared correctly. I have family that is rich and family that is poor so I see a stark contrast in how each orders food. Wealthier people almost always order a steak medium rare to rare and no steak sauce, or ketchup (cringe). There is a reason McDonalds puts ketchup with everything, including their shakes. It is to mask the poor/bland flavor of their food. The reason people had to cook their steaks so much was to prevent food born illness due to poor refrigeration and lack of money so food was kept on the shelf longer. This was also the reason most southern food is so spicy, they were some of the last states to get refrigeration so meat was often rancid and spices were used to mask the bad flavors.
0	It wasn't so much the war but rather poor understanding of food-borne illness and proper ways to handle food. The war which I'm assuming you mean WW2, propelled biological research and that continues through the cold war into today. This led to a change in thinking about how we handle and cook our food. Let's say for instance in the past they knew that rare meat got you sick and that it was somehow related to bacteria, So the official safe guideline was cook it all the way through. Later on someone figured out that If you kept meat cold before you ate it there would be less existing bacteria to start with and cooking 80% of steak would still maintain it at a safe level. The official safe temperature is lowered but med-well to well is not a vast enough change to cause anyone to change their ways. It wasn't until years of research and emergence of newer generations to adopt the practice. This was also spurred on by the advent of Americas large super-corporations and their test kitchens. Companies like Hormel and Kraft put millions into finding out exactly how to keep their meat from spoiling for the longest possible time. This combined with the food distribution infrastructure created by those corporations led to the widespread availability and affordability of quality time/temperature controlled meats. Organizations like the Pork Council spent millions on education to boost sales of pork since you can eat some cuts medium rare with about the same risks as eating a med-rare cut of beef.
1	In terms of learning ADC on a higher level, I'd say tristana is one of the best champs to do it with. Went from silver 1 to plat 1 pretty much exclusively with her. She trades very well, is very forgiving in terms of being able to get out of sticky situations with her jump and ult, and by playing her, you begin to see the mechanics of what makes an adc.   Past lane phase, her damage is pretty much entirely autohits. This lets you practice simply autohitting on a high level, like firing a shot and moving immediately to cancel the rest of the animation, or using the A-move feature to fire quickly on the run without having to worry about actually clicking on the enemy. End of the day, with enough Tristana, you learn what makes an ADC: Positioning and autohitting. The number one reason that Tristana wins games is her ability to do those two things absurdly well late game. Her w lets her jump around to reposition after every kill/assist, her passive range increase keeps her at a safe autohitting distance, and her ult lets her peel for herself, giving her all the tools to autohit and position at will. Not to mention a 90% attack speed steroid to help out those autohits.

1	Your LP gains and losses in ranked are determined by your MMR compared to what MMR is expected for someone in your tier/division.   EFT = Expected MMR for your tier/division   MMR < EFT --> LP gains < LP losses. The system thinks you should be in a lower division/tier.   MMR = EFT --> LP gains ~= LP losses. The system thinks you are roughly where you belong.   MMR > EFT --> LP gains > LP losses. The system thinks you should be in a higher division/tier.   Furthermore, in division 1 of any tier LP gains/losses are also affected by clamping. Clamping stunts your LP gains/losses. Clamping gets more severe the closer you get to your promotion. It is possible to gain +0 LP for a win if you are at ~99 LP and your MMR is insufficient for the next tier. For more information on clamping please read [this]( post.   Additionally, your LP gains and losses are also affected by the average MMR of your team compared to the average MMR of the enemy team.   For more information about the league system read the [Season 3 FAQ](   For more information about MMR read [this](
1	While watching high-elo streams I saw some awesome things people could do with Riven out of curiosity I wanted to know how they do it, I stumbled over a Video that shows what kind of animation cancelling you can do with her it's far beyond the animation cancelling other champions usually can, so huge congratuliations to everybody who can pull those amazing things of  but  the problem with it is that her skills can just come out insanely fast and in very quick succession thus dealing lots of damage (some might even want to say:  Tons of Damage ) in a very short time this leaves the space for counterplay incredibly small causing threads like this one and being very frustrating to play against a good Riven will also get catched very easily. Riven's kit can  if executed properly  be very good at dueling enemies and evading enemies, her 3rd Q can jump over walls (which isn't easy to do, at least not for me), she has a shield that is combined with a gap closer an with the right animation cancelling almost instant stun and an Ultimate which executes very well and increases the range of her abilities and auto attacks. The overall counterplay to her kit is very limited as most of her abilities are most instant e.g. her stun you can just E and then W stunning the enemy for 0.75 seconds while shielding which should give you enough protection to reach your 3rd Q stack to knock the enemy up combined with a few auto attacks and maybe a Tiamat or Hydra this should be enough to bring the enemy very low making her Ultimate very dangerous as it is almost impossible to evade it as it moves as fast as the old Zed Shadow (around 2000 Missile Speed) making it incredibly hard to dodge especially for people with slower reactiontime or not so good internet connection. All this make her a frustrating enemy to face, especially if the player behind it is very good with the animation cancelling.
1	they used to have that as kayles passive, and it made her incredibly broken (was like s1 or something). if they make it like it, it'd be incredibly op like it was on kayle, except people will abuse it on people like jax, who are already incredibly strong atm. or if it was given really low values so it's not over powered, it'd very easily be underpowered and never used.
1	That's possible. I've been gaming since the mid 90s on PC and since the 80s on consoles. I've also been a heavy PC user for well over 20 years.   A few years ago I started to develop a pain in my left wrist area (around the tendons), as well as stiff and sore joints in my hands, especially my index and middle finger. Between long office hours (programmer) and all the extra time gaming, I figured that it was between CTS and the early stages of rheumatoid arthritis which runs in my family.   Anyhow, around this time I had just gotten into weight training. I noticed within the first month that my hands didn't ache nearly as much, and that the joint stiffness was almost gone too. I decided to apply the training directly to my hands.   I bought my first set of Captains of Crush hand grips (.5) and used them every other day (the knurling is rather rough on the hands at first) but I can close the .5 (120lbs) like nothing else. After using these for a while, the pain is completely gone and my grip strength is far better. I was already deadlifting a lot more than that but it applies differently when you're directly closing just 1 hand on it. I also started using the hand bands they sell and I've been pain and stiffness free for a long time.
1	Not meaning to be a dick here but this is already Ro8 so...   Now on a serious note, I think the best solution would be merge both teams to make a really competitive one and another who could work as a nice sparring while developing new talent.   My best guess would be keeping Shy as top lane and Flame to mid (several times has been stated that he wrecks Ambition there) I've been liking Daydream so he should be in jungle. With both Madlife and Space on bot lane. While many show no respect for Space I find him to be the most consistent player on Frost (even more than our beloved GodLife). That team would wreck many teams, the thing is that SKT T1 K and KT Rolster Bullets are way beyond the other teams, the champion of Winter should be the winner of that semi, anything else would be an upset.
1	Yeah because the reason this kid didnt just make a new acc is because he has skins/champs etc that were bought with RP.   You are an idiot if you think that, because its a free game, that riot are not money hungry.   Let me ask you this then, If someone is permabanned, why are they not IP banned like EVERY other game on the face of the earth. Why? So you can create a new account, do the same shit, and spend more money.
1	Laning phase he is very strong, I will agree with you on that with his ability to gank, and his strong poke, but during team fights he can't really do much except poke with his Q. Most likely late game he won't be tanky so he can't initiate as well.
0	The whole "men get raped, too" argument isn't helping anyone   Sure, how about that:   Since the vocal minority of your gender called feminists, which emerged as a bunch of too self-conscious women who thought women of early to-mid 1900s were informed enough to have the right to vote and should've been gone by now, but for some reason continues striving completely discredits the fact that male rape is somehow important (but not female rape), we, males, have to play passive aggressive because of the stereotype-based patriarchal society you have been helping us to build throughout the millennia?
1	I'll be doing like why team x picks  champs a b c e f and team y picks 1 2 3 4 5. then how team x is playing their comp against team y then, team decision making like vision, objective and map pressure, over all somewhat like why team x is doing this against team y and team y should this when team x is doing this.
1	people are only moaning about the meta because it doesn't match their playstyle and they are reluctant/don't know how to adapt.   In actual fact if you look at the game it has never been so balanced before, if they make any major changes to the current meta I can't see it being for the better. Early game is no longer as strong, but if you get really ahead you have to be much better than the other team and actually use your advantage and keep playing well to prevent the other team from coming back, this punishes teams which are lazy and start derping after they get a lead thinking its a win anyway. In the snowball meta you could just get a lead, derp around and still win which is kinda unfair and sometimes luck based. If you look at the champions they are actually really balanced atm aswell, win rates for the best champions are at around 53-54%, which are usually much higher at around the 56-57% mark. This suggests that the game is really balanced and many champions can have a big impact and no one champions just stomps everything, i.e. team composition and skill/teamwork with certain champions is more important to win games. This is even evident with bans as now when I play there are so many good champions to ban that i struggle to decide which one to choose.
1	Supports need to support with their kits and not with exces gold they get now. They need to be cc/utility bots. They dont need fucking lyandries on zyra (even if no one plays zyra atm). Fiddle was in perfect spot before his fear nerf. That fear was what described his personalty as a champion and as a support. He had that long single target hard cc with decent silence and decent dmg if he gets off nice ulty, there was no need to nerf him so hard since tenacity already had great impact on fear duration (longer cc duration more longer you negate it with tenacity). We now see leona with gold close to junglers even if she is supporting and she turns into fucking super cc tank. That wasnt supposed to happened. If she is supporting she should have decent and maybe below par tankines compared to top laner and jungler. She now just becomes even more tanky then jungler and has far more superior cc. Leona just outshines rest of supports traditional or not traditional. There is ofc thersh that i think is in perfect place when it comes to kit but he too becomes too tanky with excess gold he gets in this preason.
0	Feminism is gender specific in name.   That's because it's 100+ years old.  I modern corollary is the "Gay Rights Movement".  Gay Rights isn't about giving rights to gay people that are denied to straight people... it's about equality for people of all sexual identities.  The fact that it's name is specific to one sub-group is because that is a notable subgroup that is lacking their basic rights.  Feminism started the same way;  it's for gender equality, but was named for the group that was lacking rights.   > Feminism is gender specific in message   Well yeah, it mostly focuses on women.  Because (for the most part) men don't need that much help.   Now I need to be clear here.  I'm  not  saying that men have everything perfect.  Gender roles  definitely  hurt men as well.  But when you put things on a theoretical scale, it's clear that women are more disenfrachised and men are more empowered, on a societal level (your individual results may vary).   So the end result is that feminism focuses  more  on womans' rights, but it  also  pays attention to the general abolishment of gender roles.  While feminists will campaign strongly for little girls to play with legos, they'll also advocate for little boys to have dolls.   On your 2 topics at the end, I fundamentally disagree.   For one, I don't think equality is about "lowering" anyone.  It should be about raising us all up to the same level.  You seem to think that feminists need to do things that detriment women in order to be advocating equality, but being a detriment to  anyone  is bad.   I also think the main goals of feminism are  universally good .  It doesn't need to target a specific group in many instances, because it's just good for all of us.   Here's an example; feminism is against the idea that women are weak caregivers and men are strong breadwinners.   Now an obvious way this sees play is for gender equality in the workforce, the glass ceiling, all of that.  But let's look at another side of this:   Custody battles.   Currently, women win custody battles in 90% of cases.  You may be thinking "Yeah, gender equality should fight against that!".  Well... feminism is.   The reason women are awarded custody is because our society says that a woman's role is as a caregiver.  By erroding this societal standard, there will be a shift in the way these court decisions are decided.  For every new stay at home dad supported by his working wife, it becomes easier to award custody to a man.   By the same token, men pay far more in child support than women do.  This is because of the gender role that men are the breadwinners.   Again, feminism is very very against this.  The more women we have in the workforce, though, the easier it becomes to decide that a man should be awarded custody  and child support payments  from his ex-wife.  Something that is currently nearly unheard of.
1	It's alot of older players, and it's actually pretty interesting from a sociatal stand point how all of this went down. Pretty much he started the reignofgaming site, which consisted of a few tier lists. These tier list were the first real guide lines to non pro players on what to play and how strong it was. People acted like these tier lists were the bible and it ended up being a HUGE detriment to the league community. It gave people a reason to be toxic, and because a pro stood behind it there was a huge circlejerk if you picked anything considered low tier, playing then was infuriating. People really disliked him for it and bashed him REALLY hard. Like people have killed themselves over some of the things people were telling him, it got pretty out of hand. So he went on tilt (I'm assuming now) as he is an emotional guy and got kicked from team after team. Now people hate him just to hate him, kinda like teemo, and he rages alot but that has more to do with actual trolls who are actively trying to lose games they're in with him. And that's where we are now.
1	Is he still considered a professional? I'm genuinely curious about this. He was a professional player at one point in time, but now he isn't good enough to play for a professional team (at least in terms of LCS and such since he isn't on a team anymore), so is he still considered a professional? Or is it more like he WAS a professional LoL player?   Are people considered professionals forever if they make it to the "pros" for at least 1 season or something? Or are people only considered pro's as long as they are in the professional leagues?   Sorry for somewhat repeating myself, but yea...
0	This reminds me of a time when, many years ago, I regularly parked my car across the street in front of the place I was renting.  I had to do so because of reasons. Anyway, one day the guy across the street uses some hot asphalt to make a shitty (and illegal) ramp so he can get his car up onto his front lawn.   He already had one driveway.   He proceeds to inform me that I can't park on the street anymore because "it's his driveway now, and it's illegal to block a driveway."   So, before I was born, my dad used to work for the city planning department. He knows his shit about zoning and permitting and all that red-tape. So I ask my dad, "what does the code of our fair city have to say about arbitrary driveway declarations?"   My dad informs me that one needs to obtain the city's blessing, which is expressed in a form known as the "curb-cut permit," if one wishes to do such a thing.  So I ask the asphalt-pourer if he's gotten a curb-cut permit.   "No," he says, "I need to park my car on my lawn so it's my driveway now."  [His attitude when.](   Well, it was a huge pain in the ass for me to park my car anywhere else because of reasons. It was entirely legal for me to park on the street as I did, since I moved the car at least once every 24 hours.   So, one night I got drunk, and (at about 2AM on a sunday IIRC) took a sledgehammer to that bastard's sorry excuse for a driveway: just whalloped the living shit out of that pathetic asphalt ramp. In the space of five minutes I had scattered it all to hell and back.   Fuck that guy. If he'd gotten the permit, I would have said, "fine, I'll park up the street." Due to the high density of rental homes on that street, each spilling over with slackers and their tatty vehicles, it would have been about 200 yards up the street, though.
0	While I agree, OP seems to be going for the low hanging fruit making fun of the people who argue the most extreme and idiotic versions of these arguments. While there are people who argue for the most extreme versions of these statements, I think there are plenty of non virgin, non sheltered, adults who could intelligently argue the underlying sentiments behind the two issues. Such as "you should try to be financially stable before you have kids" or "regardless of the attackers gender you have a right to self defense."
0	Ok, first, IANAL and I don't know where you live; but I'm an old fuck, with kids, and plenty of experiences with leases, breaking leases, and landlords.   Ok, here's your first issue. Does the lease provide for an early termination of the lease? Sometimes it says you can leave by paying 2 months or something. If not, do you have something in writing saying you're supposed to pay "half" or some other proportion? How did you determine what is "fair" and what's "overcharging"? Without that, you have a history of what you paid prior, which is going to make it look like that's what you agreed to, and now you've had a change of heart. Saying he lied to you, when you signed a lease with numbers on it and you've been paying X amount, isn't a very strong argument -- I wouldn't want to be in your shoes telling a judge "hey, i didnt know what I signed" or how much the lease was or how much i was paying (%).   More bad news. You can't break the lease (usually) without both Land lord and your co-signers agreeing (and, if one or both agrees, i'd get it in writing). Otherwise your roommate can come after you to hold you to the lease and/or (definitely) the Land Lord will hold you and roommate to the lease terms. And, either roommate and/or landlord would win, if it goes to a judge and one or the otehr want to make you pay. Roommate could probably get you to keep paying what you had. Landlord usually can make either of you liable for the entire remaining rents.   I'd be sure I have some casual pictures in my phone of my stuff, and it's condition; so if shit starts to actually turn up damaged, you can sue roommate for its replacement... and btw, his sublettors or guests are his responsibility if they break your shit, either way.   Now, ratting his extra sublettors out to the landlord, in a nice -- "hey, here's a heads up and I don't like it and can you break our lease or otherwise evict us" might be your best bet to get out of this bad deal.
0	Background:  My friend met a seemingly nice and mentally stable girl. After 6 months, she mentions that they should move in together (sign one).  They look at a house to rent.  Due to time constraints, they need to make a decision within three days.  He gets cold feet, and she gives him an ultimatum, either move in or break (sign 2).  They move in together, and so starts her very erratic and bipolarish behavior.  This past Friday, they meet up for happy hour.  She asks, " how much do you love me?" Him, "ehhhh."  In all seriousness, she asks, " is okay if I sleep with my boss to get a promotion?  It's not a big deal. It's just sex."
0	You gotta do this dude, honestly hes intimidating you to control you, and no offense, but your letting him do it by playing this powerless character.  Avoiding confrontation is not the answer here.  We're often told that fighting is not the answer, but this is one of those times when you gotta stand up for yourself.  If you do nothing this will just continue and even worse he will do it to others as well because he now knows it works.
0	Sociopath is a dated term, but it's usually used these days to describe psychopath-spectrum behaviors. These would include things like diminished empathy and remorse, and disinhibited or bold behavior. While those could be the case here, whether or not someone's a psychopath depends a lot more on their internal landscape.
1	You're taking what I said and making it sound black and white. Of course taking some steps to learn builds, meta, and overall flow of the game is needed all of which can be studied through videos and streams. Normal gives you little to go off of. AI teaches you how to play your champ and helps you calculate damage output of whatever you are playing. Although in normals you play against players who may have various play styles I have seen players who mainly play AI get the best of players who have over 1k games in normals. That being said, it might have to do with the fact that some people who play AI just push and exploit the fact that bots can't do certain things to get fed while others spend time practicing mechanics/champions within a stress free environment.  If this was me beginning of last year I would tell you bots offer you little, but after playing with many players who play bots I have come to the conclusion they honestly give you a better foundation for new players. You can learn and play the game at your own pace without teammate confrontations. I have been playing since Season 1 and lately I have been playing lots of AI or Ranked. I'm gold on 2 smurfs and was Plat 1 last season.
0	I'm 48. If I started smoking 1 pack a day when I was 18 at an average cost of $5.00 I would have spent approximately $56620.00. I've got way more than that in my bank account but you can't see it, you'll just have to believe me, or not.
0	My mother divorced my Dad, drugged me up after being diagnosed with ADHD. After she couldn't handle me she sent me to live with my father.   Oh she divorced him because he hit her. So yay, great things coming my way.   Dad beats me with a belt at least twice a week. Several times to the point where I couldn't sit down. If you haven't been spanked till your ass is completely bruised... Yeah. Torture is a more relevant term.   So my Mom finds out about this after a few years and takes me back one Christmas. Oh, guess what? I'M A RAGING PSYCHOPATH NOW! I don't have the adhd symptoms, but I like to hurt people. I'm also weird as fuck because I attended a Christian school.   Mom can't handle me, go figure, and sends me BACK to live with my Dad. It's like... as long as she doesn't have to see it it's ok.   Same old shit happens except this time my Dad takes the extra step to homeschool me. So I get extra quality time with this asshole. Oh and now he has me working as a roofer for $2.50 an hour. In mother fucking FLORIDA. Try heat index of 140 on the roof in summer.   So beatings happen, I'm getting brainwashed into Christianity like you wouldn't believe.   Somehow I end up back with my Mom. My brain is fucked for this whole period of my life so I don't remember why. After about two months I put my younger brother in the hospital with a bat.   Yup. Back to live with Dad. He finally throws me out while I'm trying to finish high school. Move back home with my Mom at the threat of being homeless and join the military.   The ARMY undid a lot of the damage, and grew me up fast. I wrote off the half of my family that knew what was going on with my Dad. I still love my Mom.
0	Lol screaming parents are the best. I was in a modern warfare 2 game a couple of months after it first came out and everyone was aware of "No Russian" So this mom comes on after hearing some guys and I in the lobby chirping her son (who had been calling everyone fags, cunts, pussy's but suddenly stopped when his mom came in.) so she puts on his mike and starts yelling at us telling us we should be ashamed of ourselves blah blah blah. Now believe me when I tell you that everyone in this game went after this mom asking her what kind of a terrible parent she is letting her son play a game like this, asking her if she was cooking meth and thats why she didnt know about the game being so violent. anyway this went on for like an hour before she rage quit haha.
0	I had an ex whose mother had this mentality. Her son was constantly in and out of therapy because he was pretty disturbed. He would claim he saw things (murderers, ghosts, etc) he would also make death threats towards his family.   One day his mom after receiving a suggestion from one of his professionals asked me if I could help her tell which games were good for someone his age. She couldn't believe the M rated games were not ok. After all video games are for kids. In the end she took them away for a day but then gave him them back when he began to cry because he wanted them.   To be honest I still believe he doesn't have any mental issues other than being manipulative because when I dealt with him he knew I didn't take shit and he never ended up giving me any. Whats worse is they had multiple professionals tell them the same thing but it was more convenient to believe he had the problem and that it wasn't the mothers parenting. So when a professional told her to change parenting styles she just went to another professional until they agreed with her.
0	This. Even if he did live in an area where there is a large gay social population, most of the ones that go out and are social are younger (in their early twenties to mid thirties). Just remember /u/Phaesus, you can still be yourself, even though you're out. I am sure I can figure out how strange it can be for a recently uncloseted older gay man. When I used to go to the gar bars with my friends, most of the older men there were creepers who gave off weird vibes and tried to get my friends to blow them. Not cute. However, you may be able to get in touch with some other older professional gay men through social websites. If you live near a big town (like Cincinnati or Los Angeles for example) check out their subreddits to see if there are any activities going on there. If you are from a smaller town (like mine) check something like Adam For Adam (I am guessing you might know what that is) I don't know what all you can search for on A4A but I am sure you can probably find people that are around your age that do want to hang out and do more than just hook up if that's what you are into.
0	Anyone can claim a religious affiliation to any extent of orthodoxy   This is a desperate last-ditch attempt to be allowed to wear a beard, but there is a legal definition of "religious affiliation" and you're required to meet it to get an exemption. You can't just claim you're a Muslim or something and therefore can't shave. You need the assertion of a religious organization to qualify. I, personally, have terminated people for lying about their religious affiliation in order to get around rules (though not at Publix). It's a real thing, it really happens.
0	Get a forced air respirator and you won't have to have a seal against your skin we got them at my job and the lifted the beard ban. It's like a head bag with a air pump that is on a belt that goes on your waiste
0	Well ultimately one could simply ask them, would you rather live in Africa or the First World? And should they prefer the First world, then they themselves got the good end of the deal for their lineage, the suffering of their ancestors, which I am in no way justifying, benefited them in a way that I, among others, view as a very large reason behind their current quality of life, and possibly success.
0	To be fair this is nice and all but its not good for business, it can outweigh the pros of lower labour turnover and the higher motivation for straight overheards.   It can spell the end of businesses to use this practice.   The trouble also is that if it ever couldn't happen then it can destroy motivation and expectations of the staff to a point that its more detrimental than the benefits it was giving.
0	Mental issues? So a third of the country has mental issues?   You realize there a plenty of regular ol' overweight people who just never learned proper portion control, right? It's a country wide cultural problem 30+ years in the making. Increase in poverty, the rise of dual-income households and takeout, increase in indoor entertainment, decrease in PE funding, increase in restaurant portions and free refills, emphasis on sweets/processed food for a few generations of children.   A 400 lb person probably has some serious personal issues to worth on, yes. But a 200 lb person? There are plenty of happy-go-lucky overweight people who simply need to make better dietary choices and improve their eating habits.
0	Actually, people who need to lose weight need to eat more, in most cases. There is a reason why people who only eat a meal or two a day don't lose weight, it's because their metabolism gets all out of whack and their body hinges on those one or two meals a day for all their energy. If you eat every 3 hours or so, your metabolism keeps burning calories throughout the entire day, rather than going through the peaks and valleys that one or two meals a day would put it through.   So long as you're eating healthy (lots of protein and veggies; complex carbs like whole grains, broccoli and sweet potatoes & unsaturated fats like almonds, olive oil, avocados and salmon) and exercising regularly, your body will naturally lose weight.   It's not a magic pill or a potion, you just need to set yourself up for success with discipline and planning. For example, I cook all my meals for the entire week on Sunday to help stave off any temptations during the week. When I get hungry, it's easier for me to grab something from the refrigerator than it is to go down the street to the fast food place.
0	Within Christian mythology it's a huge shift in direction, you are absolutely correct. However, the reason for the shift in direction I believe has much to do with Judaism losing power/influence while that region was occupied by the Roman Empire. The old testament writings for the most part were about a nation of people who had many successful war campaigns and conquered a decent amount of land. It also talks about the exploits of mighty kings who had Yahweh, the war god of Judea and Israel, at their side. All in all the Old Testament is about a nation of people who had the power of the god of gods supporting them.   During the reign of the Roman Empire, Israel was not the mighty nation it had once been. Many Jews would have been a lower class and therefore much poorer/powerless, than their Roman counterparts. It could have been possible that a few people within Judaism, began a new movement, or perhaps multiple movements that preached salvation for the meek and oppressed, rather than beating the war drums or sounding the horns of triumph as was seen in the old testament.   The New Testament has an overlying theme of hope for the weak. The Jesus figure was not a powerful king by earthly standards; he was just a handyman by trade. He was a figured who recognized his lowly position in society, as well as, the position most of his followers in that society. He preached patience, non-violence, forgiveness of your transgressors/oppressors, and that those who lived a good life loving God and being satisfied with what they had, would find salvation and happiness after death.   If you look at the history of that area of the world, in particular the history of the Hebrew people in that part of the world, you see a nation that was once a powerful force, but had their power stripped from them twice. Once by the Babylonians and once by Rome. The Old Testament and New Testament, aside from being fairly historically inaccurate(wrong dates, wrong leaders,etc), do for the most part reflect the time when they were supposed to have been written.   Admittedly, some of this is my own speculation. However, it is not unreasonable for the history of those people to be reflected in their holy books. Many other religious mythologies do the same thing.
1	hate the Koreans   Worst
1	It's easier to influence the game as a midlaner but a good Jungler will have much more impact on the game if he plays right. Mid lanes all abaut map awareness and jungle is all abaut objective control. as Jungler, you control which objectives your team is going after. If your seen Bot lane defending a split pusher the enemy team has a tower in bag. If your position is unseen the enemy team can't realy play agressive

0	I disagree! I have alot of good friends and they know I have a big mouth and talk alot of crap, but guess what! When shit breaks down, they know that I'm there. I'm not the "best" best friend. I'm only human and i say stuff I dont meen.   I think you just have to be honest about why you do stuff. I always stay behind what I said, even if it makes no sense and was hurtful.   But honestly, I'm probably the one who says sorry the most..
0	What cookie says.   It makes me super sad though. I didn't lose my virginity until 20 days before I turned 19 (Note so I don't seem like OAG here - I only remember that because that date is also my first ex's birthday).   But, even with "good" education for sex ed there is still tons of misinformation because it doesn't want to upset parents by teaching kids how to be safe. What I remember from my high school is that anal has no chance of pregnancy, oral can't pass STDs, that only fully straight and fully gay are your sexualities, polyamorous/open relationships don't exist, only condoms and the pill will prevent pregnancy, ad infinitum bullshit.   My school at least mentioned to take the birth control pill every day, and someone I went to high school with called me sobbing one day because her period was one (1!) day late and she's like "You wanna be a midwife, you're from a family of nurses, you must know!" So I grill her for a bit and turns out she hasn't taken her pill in about four months... Aye. :(
0	11,670?](   If you can figure out how to afford an iPhone, cable, and a car on $11,670, you probably make a lot more than $11,670.   $11,670 per year is $972.50 per month. If you deduct payroll tax using  this payroll tax calculator , that comes to $186.57 per week. There are ~4.3 weeks in a month, so that leaves $802.25 per month.   An iPhone costs what, about $60-70 per month? Cable costs about $100-110 per month. A car costs what, $100-200 per month?   Let's say you pay the  absolute lowest end  of those estimates, $60 iPhone, $100 cable, and $100 car. That comes to $260.   Can you pay  your  rent, your utilities, buy food, buy clothes, and pay for your other living expenses on $542.25 per month?
0	I don't know all the ins and outs of all religions, but I don't see what makes one religions creator any more or less credible than others. Nobody was there centuries ago when they were created, and they all require a leap of faith that atheists and science abiding individuals aren't willing to make. Joseph Smith, or the person who coined Judaism or Christianity all made a similar leap of faith, and it's not like those religions have clean hands either. There were wars over them, and I'm fairly certain most of them make enormous amounts of money off of their followers and tax free status.
0	I work with an atypical Mormon, I guess. He drinks soda. That's kind of his drug of choice. He limits himself, though. Him and his family do not dress a certain way. He curses like a sailor and talks about railing his wife all the time. His wife was actually Jewish before she converted. He's also into heavy rock, which features some very un Mormon lyrical topics.   He does go to church for hours every Sunday. His wife is his only partner ever, and they abstained til marriage. Basically, he is the opposite of an extreme Mormon, but still very faithful to his religion and church.   It's funny, we have guys night out where a few co workers will hang out after work then see an action flick. We all smoke and drink, but Mormon dude just chills with us without partaking. We're all pretty sure he got a contact buzz one time. Good stuff. Great guy, though.
0	Another interesting distinction or fun fact.  That is, if I recall my doctrine correctly (exmormon.... wow, it's been 24 years.)   Mormorns believe that the members of the traditional trinity are 3 distinct persons (or rather personages in the mo lingo). And so...   Celestial: God the Father watches over this kingdom and ministers to the people there who attain an exalted state like god himself. Like growing into full potential of spiritual adulthood. But requires rites of passage others have mentioned (whether done in life of in proxy after death).   Terrestrial: While calling the Celestial his home, Jesus the Christ will minister to the people here. Basically, any reasonably good person on earth will be in an awesome place with an occasional visit from Jesus (whether they believed in him or not.) For many Christians, this is sort of exactly what they are hoping and praying for. I hear it's nice.   Telestial: The Holy Spirit (aka Holy Ghost) will minister to people here, although he will have been given a physical body at that point, like all of god's children. Sort of like your conscience personified and being your pastor, I guess. It's important to not that that this is where liar, cheaters, thieves, etc end up. So like others have said, it's still a "heaven" and level of glory... just with like minded souls to keep you company. Mormons who just turn their back, not on the church but on just being a good human end up here just like other pricks of humanity.   Outer Darkness: To get here you needed to have been one of Satan's followers before Earth, or have had to KNOW (i.e 100% fact in god and his plan for mankind, as is seeing an angel or something like that... which you really can't deny... but do anyway.)   Fun Fact: People from higher levels can visit lower levels. So you may not be with all of your family all the time. You can still visit that dickhead sociopath of a cousin in the Telestial Kingdom.
0	I attempted to take it. I left almost 1/2 the answers blank. Most of the kids in the class did as she said. One girl who was close to the family simply sat there, never picking up her pencil, and just gave my teacher the stink eye for the entire period.
0	This isn't something that's okay to say  ever .   Speaking as someone with depression who has struggled with self-harm and suicidal tendencies and lost some people to suicide, this is about one of the worst situations I can imagine.   Not only did those students just lose someone who they had known and gone to school with for some time but then a teacher decides to impose her religious views on the matter? Scratch that. It doesn't even matter that it's a religious view. I'm religious and I'd never say shit like that.   You know why? Because things that can spark depression include [feeling like a social outcast, prejudice, and stress]( and if you're a close friend of someone who has committed suicide because of depression or something else, odds are that you struggle with similar issues.   People with depression, like me, tend to group together because few other people understand the mindset that leads you to thinking in this way. My two best friends both also suffer from depression, panic attacks, and self-harming tendencies.   This aside, being in a situation like this is bound to induce situational stress because most people would intrinsically disagree with the teacher's assessment but they are in a position of authority. [Stress is one the largest factors into psychological breakdowns]( and what that teacher just said will not be helping anyone.   Not only did this teacher slander someone who had just died, they also hurt other people who knew that person through their words and actions. That's not what a teacher is for.
0	Ex-mo here. Mormonism is very much a religion of lifestyle and ritual. You not only go to church for 3 hours every Sunday, but you accept unpaid assignments such as Sunday school teacher, bishop, Nursery teacher, clerk, etc. You follow a strict "health" code - no coffee, tea, tobacco, alcohol, recreational drugs, dress code - must have sleeves, no low cut shirts, shorts/skirts to the knee, no unusual hair styles, no body piercings other than one hole in each ear for women, no tattoos. Of course there's no sexual activity of any kind before marriage, in fact many are taught to suppress even sexual thoughts or anything that makes you feel aroused. No swearing. Women and men are expected to fill traditional gender roles and support traditional gender roles in society. Marry a Mormon and make lots of Mormon babies. Go to the temple often and perform spiritual rituals. Pay 10% of your income to the church. Do lots of community service. Mormonism has an entire culture and mindset and education system that totally shape the mind and life of a person in it. If you're dedicated to it then it dictates every aspect of your life and identity, and it teaches that if you don't follow all the rules and do all the things, you need to or God will be disappointed in you. Sorry for wall of text, on my phone
1	dude, the feral flare is just a time bomb like any other champs (vayne, ryze, jinx, lucian, and lots more) you just have to deal with it by counter jungling the opposing jungler, warding, etc. plus this is a good way to bring out some unpopular champs back to the scene. Remember when you only had lee/elise/kha/vi ? they just increased the number of stacks needed (even if the tooltip on the buff still says 25) along with the numbers of junglers that could be played without having a great disadvantage (even if it creates a bigger advantage on the endgame).
0	I make a living on art. Honestly I think it is way easier to find a job in art if you mix it with something more technical. Digital artist isnt exactly the easiest gig to land, but its a whole lot more of a 'career path' than lots of other artistic offshoots. I left my job to take care of my daughter full time for a couple years, but I still get easy 40hrs/wk of freelance work making characters for games.
0	It depends on the needs of the establishment owner. There are some places around my city that have their entire menu written up in chalk. These places might also have a menu that changes about once a month as things go in or out of season.   If I'm not mistaken, the establishment that popularized this look for my town was [Jeni's Splendid Ice Cream.]( The image in the link may actually show an old chalkboard as these days they tend to get a bit more fancy with it. So Jeni's might hire someone to go around to all of their locations and redo the chalkboards about every three months. It would be more practical than depending on the regular staff to do it as a trained artist/designer could give more consistent results. But that might not suit everyone's needs.   There's a board game bar here that hired a designer to write on four pillars covered with chalkboard paint. She did a highly designed look on  most of the surfaces and then left a blank section for the staff to write in or erase what's currently on tap. They might not ask her (or another artist) to come back for several months (or even years) to update the design.   Then there's Giant Eagle Market District... They have chalkboards all over the store. Bakery, cheese, wine, produce, restaurant, and the in-store coffee shop all have chalkboards that change on a weekly or monthly basis.   The bars in the trendier part of town use a mix of freelance designers and people who are already a part of their staff. If they have someone on staff who's got a little talent, they might just use that person's skills. But that part of town has a little chalkboard out in front of just about every establishment. Bars, antique shops, thrift stores, restaurants, and curiosity shops all have them. It's hard to walk 20 feet there without stepping around one. Since the area is saturated with that kind of thing, establishment owners are a little more willing to hire someone who'll make something that really sticks out.
0	There's nothing wrong with being an art major. Honestly, you should only ever major in something that excites you. If engineering or programming excites you, you're probably going to live a pretty easy life. You're going to find a job relatively easily and you're going to make a lot of money. Now, if you hate programming and do it for the money. Then, well, your work life is going to ruin you.   On the other hand, being an art major is a little bit harder but equally worthwhile. It's going to be harder to find a job and it probably won't pay as much, but if it's what you love to do you have to buckle up and pursue it. At the end of the day you'll be just as happy as the engineering major/programmer. However, if you pick an art major just because it's easy and you have no real passion for it, then you'll probably live a life of unfulfilling work and low pay.
1	Farming is rarely a problem in low MMR. That's just what people assume, because they can't see that what's really holding them back is very poor decision making and understanding of the game; nobody really wants to think they consistently make  terrible  decisions and read situations totally wrong, take the wrong action, go to the wrong spot, etc. You need almost nothing in the way of mechanics to get out of that range IMO, just to actually think about what's going on all throughout the map and play according to that, as opposed to tunneling on - well, anything.
1	Uhh... That's actually incorrect. Luck has an INCREDIBLY small effect on your MMR, seeing as how it can take over 100 games to climb a single tier (not silver-> gold, but silver 2 -> Silver 1) if you truly belong in that division/tier.   When you FIRST get to a new division (that you have rightfully earned and not been boosted/ect.) then yes, your win-rate should be roughly 50% since you're playing against people just as skilled as you are; but the more you play against those players, the more comfortable you get playing at that skill-level. Eventually, after enough practice, the quality of the players in the tier you are in will be below what you have achieved from your hard-work. You will carry more games and therefore get placed in a higher tier, and the process starts over and over again.   Even if you were supposed to be in bronze elo, if you (somehow) always played against low-gold players, after enough games you would learn what it takes to be a gold player.   Obviously the ELO system prevents this sort of thing because a mid-gold player will dominate a low-bronze player and reduce their MMR down to where it should be, but I'm just trying to show that luck has almost nothing what-so-ever with the tier/division you're in.   People have said it a billion times, and I'll say it again. If you're in bronze, your skill level is bronze. I've never once seen a platinum-ranked smurf get stuck in "elo hell" in low-silver ELO because they're better players.
0	actually, as proteins coagulate (cook) they squeeze out water in the meat so the more well done it is, the drier it is.  however, those parts of the bird that are submerged in broth will suck in water as osmosis attempts to balance the saline concentrations. additionally, the more connective tissue in the meat, the better it responds to long, wet, low-heat cooking, "tenderizing" and "moisturizing" the meat.   source: im a chef
0	They sell it at that price to get people in the store who are hungry. If you buy a cooked chicken for $5 then you're more likely to buy a cold salad or fries while you're there too, which causes the customer to spend more then what a raw chicken would cost($8-10).
1	I think it's interesting how up to Season 2, and even for a lot of Season 3, ADCs were ticking timebombs of "you can't deal with this" three shotting tanks, and when they are finally brought more in line with other roles everyone loses their minds.   There was a great post on the forums a while ago that highlighted this attitude. ADCs getting bursted too hard? Better nerf burst mages and assassins. ADCs not doing enough damage? Better nerf tanks and tanky items. ADCs were the center focus of balance for the LONGEST time, mostly because they were the center focus of every team comp and strategy for the longest time.   Now other roles can carry just as well, but it feels like ADCs are so much weaker. While they are weaker comparatively to Season 2 and 3, they are more in line with other roles, and we should really only be more concerned if they have less impact than any other role.   Riot has decided that every role should have the opportunity to carry in some form, ADCs were the strongest role for the majority of the game's history; significantly stronger than top lane, slightly stronger than mid, and incredibly stronger than support or jungle. Now junglers and supports are much better, ADCs are slightly worse(lets not pretend they don't hurt with a crit item or two), mid lane was a bit better for most of Season 3 and 4, but is more in line after the last slew of assassin nerfs. Top lane is kind of a wild card, with picks like Jax or Nasus that can hypercarry, but other picks that can have questionable effects on the overall pace and direction of the game, to the point of borderline uselessness.
1	ADC's shouldn't be some kind of role that gets literally shut out by a top laner with randuins or a midlaner with dfg. The whole idea here is that riot doesn't need to take stronger adc's and nerf them into the ground like they did sivir and draven but they need to make adcs exell at specific things. This is just a small example like lucian hes a lane bully he is meant to be that way and there's no reason to nerf him but champions like lets say quinn shes very unique in many ways but just the way she scales early and late make her an impossible champion to win with regardless if your good enough to solo carry. This isnt a good concept for a game because league has over 100 champions in it and about 17 are classified as adcs/marksman and i don't think i've seen anyone in challenger that mains adc and their top 3 champs aren't lucian, cait, sivir, or twitch. that's 3/4 out of 17 champions riot offers for marksman. Where the hell are the other 14??????????? They are useless and non-existent and for a good reason they cant deal with the season 4 meta of tanks being unkillable damage machines and mages that will instantly kill you even if you position well.
1	I think ADCs are in a good place now. They are not super broken, 2 shotting tanks, like they were at the start of pre-season 3 when I started this game.   They also still do the most end game damage overall and most certainly carry games if protected. My game that just got me into G2 was all about protecting our trist who was doing huge amounts of damage.
1	This is true, but if you play enough games your win rate will be at ~50%.If you are very good, lets say prof player, then yes you could have a lot more. For most of us, if you play well you get a 52-54% win rate.   If you criticize one game, then yes. I just had yesterday a game where we had a huge lead, our amumu wanted a 2 man baron and when the enemy team came, he didn't let baron regenerate and just kept poking it. Resulted in him dying and giving baron. Changed the whole game and we lost.
1	Exactly. Pretty much any of the popular supports shit on Kog for the first 20 minutes of the game. I actualy think that it's perfectly fine for supports to have a strong laning phase, but I think some ADs just have ridiculously weak laning phases. I think Rito is putting too much emphasis on damage values when trying to evaluate how weak a champs laning phase has to be to justify his lategame.   Lategame dps is not just about the damage part, but also about the "seconds" or time part, which is where especialy Kog has problems. Having an escape mechanism effectively gives you more dps because you survive and deal damage for a longer period of time. This is also where cast times and animations come into play. For example, Vayne, Twitch have all of their damage bound to their autoattacks. There is no additional animations they have to go through to put out the maximum amount of damage. Varus, Corki and Ezreal are the exact opposite, in that they have a lot of power bound to cast times and animations and need to go through these and "waste time" to deal the maximum amount of dmg. Cait, Lucian and Quinn (in that order) are somewhere in between casters and autoattackers, seeing as they have fairly long animations they need to go through, but also a fairly powerful autoattack steroid.   You could argue that early to late balancing being too much about the damage aspect of "DPS" is the reason why champions with a flatter powercurve are more effective. Cait, Lucian and Twitch are prime examples for this phenomenon. Only in rare cases like Ryze, Jax, Renekton, Vayne and Lee Sin a bigger amplitude in the power curve is worth it.
1	As a Twitch player, Twitch is nothing more than a product of the Meta right now.   You ask why he was less popular for a while? It's not the new model. Twitch was insanely popular in the 2013 Summer Split, but you did not nerf him out of popularity, the reason he faded was due to meta shifts.   First and foremost, twitch's largest weaknesses are high burst that he can't stealth away from, and enemy champions with quick harass patterns that can get in, do damage and get out before twitch can stack his poison and Contaminate for massive damage. Near the end of the summer split, the assassin mid lane became very popular. While bad news for many ADCs, Twitch was one of the most affected, as he relies on his 850 range in teamfights to survive, and Ahri and Zed could close that distance instantly. Twitch was suddenly a lot less powerful.   Then, the Trinity Force rework happened. Suddenly burst ADCs like Corki and Lucian were not just viable but top-tier, and twitch's biggest weakness, early game burst lanes, became the standard bot lane. About this time, the high-burst Annie support also rose in popularity. After Corki got nerfed, the bot lane meta shifted to Sivir/Jinx/and/Lucian ADCs and Thresh/Leona/Annie supports. Bot had become a deathlane that Twitch was not suited for. About this time the tanky rushdown top meta was in full swing. This meta was bad for any ADC without an escape or movespeed steroid, Twitch among them.   Twitch does not thrive in this environment at all, and became one of the least picked ADCs at the time (barring Quinn and Urgot), sitting next to Miss Fortune and Kog'Maw in terms of popularity. (Also big 2013 champs that got ousted due to the meta.) But meta is change. No meta lasts forever, and with the season 4 changes to snowballing, assassin mids fell out of flavor and building for late game suddenly became more preferable. This put carries back in the top lane instead of Mundo and Shyvana.   Another unexpected thing happened about that time too. Morgana took to support, weakening the bot lane all-in lanes, and Lulu and Soraka became popular in solo lanes, giving Twitch his much needed peel late game. This allows Twitch to operate at full capacity.
1	Im not sure about twitch tho,im feeling like Twitch is MF lategame version.   But Lucian is more like Ezreal 2.0 and his kit is amazing but not overpowered. I just totally agree that ADs are generally not that good. Either they are good/ok for laning but not good afterwards or they are (super) bad early/mid but good late. This including laneswaps,2v1 or 4v0,2v2 and generally duel power.   Twitch is imho only played because he has a MF like ult(and MF was so broken season3 beginning(was s3, right?) that destroyed the enemy team alone and he has with his ult such a high range that it doesnt matter that much that he has no escape, because you just need some champions to iniate and twitch can autoattack for free for ~2seconds without interrupting.
1	Mf buff is good but not great. Caitlyn is still there, ez is still there, he just needs to snowball hard same with sivir same with jinx, which after ADC nerfs it's pretty hard to, draven is a draven story; Draven Draven Draven Draven Draven.*
1	I feel that Lucian is what an adc  should  be. This is because he has decent wave clear, mobility, early, mid and late game. He also has a passive that suits his role very well.   Twitch is what an adc  could  be. He has a far more niche role an an AD pseudo-assassin. I think his skill set and character design are good and fit the role. It should not be replicated though.   Lucian's should be. Ezreal is a character with a similar skill-set to Lucian but worse scaling due to lower base attack speed and attack speed per level, purely because of his passive. He has a passive that increases his AS but then a base AS lower with low enough scaling to almost negate it. Makes no sense
1	I feel the changes on season 4 to make carry jungler viable, huge tanky tops like Renek, Shyvanna, Mundo or Trundle and a shifting midlaner meta between high sustain/shield champs like Lulu, Orianna or Kayle and bursty champs like Syndra, Le Blanc and Orianna turned ADC in just anti-tower champs and not the DPS champ it used to be   I stoped playing ADC cause I can't deal with some extremely dominant supps like Annie or Leona, later in the game I couldn't do anything against the super tanks that hard-force an engage allowing that bursty champs to instakill me. The only thing I could do was trying to survive doing poor damage and help destroying towers   I'm not complaining that a bursty champ can 100-0 and ADC or that supertanks can force an engage so hard. But the combo of this two things, with tons of heals, shields, scaling utility and carry/assasin junglers is just too much for an ADC   But at the same time there are not too much items to play ADCs as anti-tower champs, ADC build is pretty standard and unless you pretend to stack BTs there's nothing that gives you just AD or AS everything comes with crit. that doesn't give anything to that job
1	Not sure if you are trolling... But I'll explain anyway.   Two things. First of all your list of options in other lanes show perfectly why we need ADCs in botlane. Because with very few exceptions the champions simply don't work outside of 2 man lanes. (Or free farm laneswaps.)   Why do teams need ADCs? Towers. You could easily build a composition without an ADC, that will beat most ADC based compositions in straight up fights. They would however have problems sieging or defending if they get behind.   Your argument is that if a role is necessary they must be balanced or even OP, which from a mathematical standpoint might be correct. ADCs are OP in the same way supports where OP in earlier seasons because they were the ones who could provide utility while buying wards.   Outside of sieging they feel lackluster. And if your team is bad at pealing they are completely useless. This is especially true for non pros (so just about everyone), which contrary to popular belief is a lot more important than the pro scene.
1	I personally feel movement should mostly be based on what a champions role is designed to be.   Take Braum for example he is a big guy which in real life would usually mean he is slower, plus he is carrying a huge shield, lets compare him to a worlds strongest man competitor - when they are running with a heavy item they don't go fast they can get at best a jogging speed, but he has a ms of 335.   Now we take Ezreal he is a small guy with not much to carry, his body build and characteristics as an explorer allow you to assume he should be able to run a hell of a lot faster than braum (yes with all the belts he would slow down but lets ignore that fact), now ezreal has a base ms of 325 which is 10 slower than braum's base ms.
1	For what it's worth if I were forced to guess I'd say you were making that up (statistically you, as a random person on the internet I know nothing else about, are most likely to be at the middle of the pack for any given game).  But frankly it doesn't matter whether or not you're being truthful.  Nothing you just said makes my statement concerning probability any less true.  You could be the best player in the world at every video game ever made and your success rate in those games would still be determined by probability.
1	This goes back to balance changes.  If they nerf those adc's being able to carry in botlane will be near impossible.  Where I am at in platinum it is extremely hard for botlane to carry, even when your adc gets 5 plus kills early.  I know this because I main support and make it really hard for my adc to lose lane.  Thus we usually win lane but it doesn't matter if another lane does poorly.  Bot has nearly no carry potential.  If they nerf the main strong adc's bot will be completely irrelevant.
1	This exact same post came up at the end of season 3 and got over 3000 comments:   **[Dec 2013](   So, what has happened since December, 2013? Here's an adc-specific cliffnotes of each  patch :   3.9= Corki (+)   4.1= Jinx (-) (E damage reduced at early levels)   4.2= Ashe (+) (Hawkshot "buff")   4.3= Corki (+)   4.4= Ezreal (+) Kog'maw (+) (increased dmg for AD Kog, nerfed AP ratios, however) Sivir (-) (Q nerf) Tristana (+)   4.5= Graves (+) Miss Fortune (+)   4.6= none  Twitch VU, significant [increase]( in Twitch play persisting still   4.7= Miss Fortune (+/-) (increased AP ratios, not very impactful as ADC)   PBE currently= Tristana (+)   2x:Nerfs, 10x:Buffs   So are there any "I'm so glad they are tweaking other ADC's every few weeks and making them more viable" posts? no (well, I found  one   I don't believe the "buff other ADC's" is a viable argument. To say that Twitch/Lucian are disproportionately awesome, but shouldn't be touched is obviously silly. Each ADC can't win 50+% of their games, it's just not reasonable. Options exist outside of Twitch and Lucian - use them.   The bottom line for me on this issue is: (
1	The thing about is that it's a company who put their community before money. It has always been a pioneer for gaming people who play LOL tend to forget its a company with multiple AAA games and have been around for a while now and even own Steam! In saying that, Valve aren't doing this for their own profit even though they have made around 10million in their own pocket after costs and all. So its something Riot can learn from, because Valve put the community first, it's a community that wants to help itself out. Riot can still keep their way of hosting a tournament, but also take on board a community driven prize pool and with that probably beat valves records. Their is no reason Riot shouldn't do it, all they need to do is hope their community is like valves and they need to risk a little of their own.
0	It's absolutely ridiculous. Mark Cuban is not a stupid man. If Mark Cuban had prejudiced feelings, towards any race, he would NOT come out and say it, in light of the current situation. He's not defending Sterling, and he's not say that he is a racist himself. He's explaining human nature. And I believe him 100%. I believe we all make judgements, and perhaps some of them are prejudiced.   While we're on the topic, this is going to set a precedent. If Sterling is out, and Mark Cuban releases another statement, he could be next. Just like the whole Washington Redskins ordeal. Harry Reid, who has many important issues to deal with, is spending his time leading a group of 50 Senators to try and force the Redskins to change their 'offensive' name. And yes, it's not the most PC name, but why is today the day that it suddenly became unbearable? And if they change their name, the Braves will have to, the Fighting Irish will have to stop using the name, and every high school in America who uses a name that could possibly be SLIGHTLY offensive to ANY group, not just Native Americans, will have to change their name.
0	There's specific news services (BBC News, Reuters, AP) and newspapers (The Guardian, Washington Post, New York Times) that are good, but really, just not watching TV news makes a huge difference in static/signal you'll get, imo. Even the front page of sites like CNN's or Fox News have much more relevant information and stories than their actual TV broadcasts. Though sometimes it requires some digging into the 'national' and 'international' sections.   Google News is also good for getting lots of stories from a variety of sources all in one place.
0	I love when anything even hinting of mentioning race happens in the sports world all the sudden every single black reporter on ESPN becomes a racism expert and then try to make it seem like they are the ones who get to deem where the racism line is drawn.   Ex: Mike Wilbon on Cuban - "I could have done without the mentioning of the hoodie and tattoo"   Well Wilbon I don't give a fuck what you could have done without. People blowing these comments out of proportion is becoming dangerous. Soon anyone with any sort of power or money to lose will not be allowed to express/have any sort of opinion in fear of getting ruined by the media.
0	The reason people want to prove the other side wrong is that other side doesn't understand how their position affects other people.  If someone like a politician or a celebrity starts talking about net neutrality is unnecessary, people directly affected don't start saying "ok, it's good that you have an opinion".   But even that's not a good example because in that scenario the person with the opinion will be impacted the same way everyone else is.  With things like gay marriage and racism, the people with these "ok opinions" aren't affected negatively by the "ok opinions".  If a straight person is against gay marriage, they come out on top no matter what because either way they don't lose out on any privilege.  The loser is the gay people who want to get married.  This applies with racism too, which historically in this country has been in favor of whites.
0	Depends on what you are focusing on. It's called stereotyping. If he sees a young black male with a hoody over his head he said he gets scared. Is it wrong to think this even though there are incidents that make this scenario true? I don't think so. Is it offensive? Yes to the majority of black males who are amazing citizens and have no reason for someone to fear them. But is it rational and safe to assume the worst? Yep.   What about the white dude with his face tatted up? Do I think it possible that the dude could be an amazingly religious, conservative individual and that he wants nothing more than to simply pass by and nothing to do with me? Sure...   The point is that we spend our entire lives stereotyping everything. From what a hamburger tastes like to what a rap musician looks like to how sane homeless people are.   The fact that he said a black kid in a hoodie and the white dude was tatted up had nothing to do with the degree in which each race has to go to be considered dangerous. If you see a white male in a gang-themed outfit you're going to go to the other side of the road as well.   It is and remains that the fact of the matter is that we as a human race are very shallow and our first impressions come from our sight. If we see something that looks dangerous, we're going to avoid it.
0	I was surprisingly moved by one of Stephen A. Smith's monologues on First Take. He diverged from the actual question into a more interesting discussion of conformity in the black community. Although it's a fine line to walk, I don't think he was wrong to suggest that a degree of conformity to the standards of society at large is necessary, and maybe even more so than for other groups, for the educational and economic success of young black individuals. Although his point about wearing a suit to work wasn't exactly profound, he used it as a springboard to criticize athletes for preaching a message of "keep it real" that can substantially worsen a young individual's chance of success. He was essentially making the claim that athletes, despite working incredibly hard and often coming from difficult backgrounds, can speak from a position of privilege without realizing it. What worked for them or works for them is not always a principle applicable to non-professional athletes.   Personally, I've always been wary of the assimilationist mentality that gets wrapped up in the King-ean notion of equality that emerged from the Civil Rights Movement. An examination of King's rhetoric reveals an equally compelling notion of equality, which is equality inclusive of difference rather than in spite of it. You don't ignore blackness because we are all human; rather that blackness empowers you as one of the defining traits of your humanness. Race is not something you simply attempt to overcome or absorb, but something you attempt to understand and empathize with; there are pluralistic ideological roots that attempt to equalize without flattening. With all of that said, however, there is a practical element to assimilation Stephen A. Smith is drawing attention to. People of all races and backgrounds must to a degree conform in order to ensure the possibility of their own success. It's a fine line to walk, but it is one all minority groups have had to deal with. For example, the struggle between differentness and assimilation can be seen as the primary issue underlying most of Jewish history.   It seems I've gone off on my own rant, but my whole point was that sometimes "race baiters" can incite meaningful discussion. While I think it would be better if we had Cornel West instead of Stephen A. Smith talking about race, sometimes the discussion is still productive rather than fanatical.
0	Can we all calm down just a little bit on this one guys?  We don't need to create our own reaction that is just as bad as the reaction we are condemning here.  I have personally heard a lot of pretty accepting and nuanced commentary on Cuban's comments (listen to the first segment of PTI yesterday for a good example).   Of course the 24 hour news machine is going to go full tilt into outrage mode, that's their business model, it's how they make money.  I feel pretty safe in assuming that most of the people who frequent this site understand that.   We, as a culture, could definitely get better about talking about race.  I think all of us are sometimes guilty of retreating to our respective foxholes too quickly on this subject, regardless of which side of the issue we find ourselves on.  But if we want to get better about this, we can't just start lobbing grenades at each other and keep belly-aching about those damn racist bigots or those hypocritical SJWs who always/never blah blah blah blah . . . . We need to start taking each other seriously and realize that past a certain point of obvious, foaming at the mouth bigotry, we are all on the same side and that race is an issue that we are all trying to get better at.   My personal take on the subject is that Cuban raised a pretty good point about not necessarily exiling someone with views he considered inappropriate, but with trying to work with them and help them come around.  I don't necessarily feel like that applies to Donald Sterling here; but as a fellow NBA owner, I can see where he is worried about the precedent set by a guy being forced to sell his team over things he said in the supposed privacy of his own home.  However, the example of a black guy with a hoodie was kind of an unfortunate one and that he probably should have used a less charged example to get his point across, something [Cuban himself concedes](
0	I missed your point.   Like I said in my profanity-laden auto-mod-baiting reply, "you must have said something really fucked up".   I never said I wanted anything banned, fuck you very much.  I never liked UOP, but I don't think it should have been banned.  I suggested that instead of bitching about it pointlessly you could start your own sub specifically for that meme so people have somewhere to post them.  Then people who want to see it can subscribe to your sub  and  Advice Animals and see what they want to see.  Hell,  I'd  subscribe, because even though I thought 90% of them were stupid, they were occasionally funny.  If I wasn't willing to wade through stupid to find funny, I wouldn't be on Reddit.
0	Oh yes, the "Why aren't you tolerating my intolerance" defense. Does wanting to eliminate bigoted speech in turn make me a bigot? I say no. Here's why: striving for tolerance is inherently at odds with intolerant beliefs. In the reverse, intolerance also seeks to eliminate tolerance. Now I'm going to cut this into something more specific: Bigotry. Going to the definition we get: Bigotry - bigoted acts or ideas. So we go to Bigot specifically:  a person who strongly and unfairly dislikes other people, ideas, etc. Key word: unfairly. Hating a cold blooded murder and wanting to excluded them from society (at least until they pay for their crime or are rehabilitated) is not bigotry since it is justified. In the same way, actual bigots (racists, misogynists, Nazis, etc) are not justified in their actions. They unfairly attack others and seek to make their lives worse.  Being intolerant against a bigot is justified since they seek to harm others in various ways.  That's the key. Bigots are not justified in their actions, they do not get to be defended against intolerance. And as a final point I'm going to quote [Karl Popper on the paradox of tolerance](   >Unlimited tolerance must lead to the disappearance of tolerance. If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them. – In this formulation, I do not imply, for instance, that we should always suppress the utterance of intolerant philosophies; as long as we can counter them by rational argument and keep them in check by public opinion, suppression would certainly be most unwise.  But we should claim the right to suppress them if necessary even by force; for it may easily turn out that they are not prepared to meet us on the level of rational argument, but begin by denouncing all argument; they may forbid their followers to listen to rational argument, because it is deceptive, and teach them to answer arguments by the use of their fists or pistols.  We should therefore claim, in the name of tolerance, the right not to tolerate the intolerant. We should claim that any movement preaching intolerance places itself outside the law, and we should consider incitement to intolerance and persecution as criminal, in the same way as we should consider incitement to murder, or to kidnapping, or to the revival of the slave trade, as criminal.
0	Nonono, you see, people need to be protected from their own stupidity.   For instance, not seeing the huge contradiction that is an "unpopular opinion" meme being popular enough to appear on the front page time and again, and the problem in that.   So the administrators take the only logical step and ban that clusterfuck. Because, obviously, the majority of the community lacks elementary reasoning.
0	The user who started r/atheism in the first place (his name escapes me at the moment) had a very hands-off approach to moderating the sub, so it allowed almost anything.   However, he was so hands-off that he hadn't logged in for a year, so two of the mods over there told reddit that they wanted to take over the sub.  They got control of it and immediately eliminated any and all memes (or, as they called them may-mays - because anyone who actually liked memes was a child) without getting input from the community.   The reason was that the memes were like quick soundbites and got a lot of karma; and, as a result, were the things that usually got the the top of r/all.   The upshot was that r/atheism split into a couple factions (atheismrebooted and a couple other subs were started for people who wanted the old style).  Then, r/atheism lost it's place as a default subreddit.
0	Reddit rallies behind net neutrality, meanwhile mods filter out a meme.   I was never a huge fan of it, but also never hated it. Why not let the upvotes decide what memes can be on here?   EDIT:
1	When I started playing LoL I got the game in spanish and instead of ''G'' of gold it was ''O'' of oro.
1	Nobody will ever see this and it is against the meta, since it is to love Phreak hard, but I do not like him casting.   LCS has become the real deal and a major face of electronic sports for the US and EU scene and it is becoming professional and that is part of what draws in the new crowd. When people come to watch a professional game and hear Phreak as their first caster they associate it with an unprofessional spirit or mannerism. This is also why I don't like him casting.   To his defense, I am almost sure I would love to hang out with him and I'd imagine I'd get along with him. His memory/ability to recollect prior games and plays is almost unparalleled (except for maybe Monte Christo), his game understanding is top notch, and his strategy awareness is obviously above that of many of the other casters or even guys on the analyst desk.   The point is, his bad puns do not belong on the main stage for a game that is trying to become the face of professional esports as his mannerisms just aren't professional. A good pun every now and then would be fine, but he shotguns them in there and tries to fit as many puns as he possibly can. Despite how intelligent the guy clearly is, it doesn't come across as intelligent or professional.
1	Because she is toxic to the game, she has a possible 1600 damage nuke on a 6 second cooldown, with a broken hitbox.   Also she has little weakness to compensate for this absurd damage, she is incredibly safe in the laning phase and throughout the game with her huge heals and her cougar "w".   Her slightly weak teamfighting can be compensated by having a disengage heavy team or seiging comp, she only has to land one or maybe two successful spears before you can engage and win a team fight because the carries are very low, or have to base to heal.   She is toxic to the game because you can miss most of your skill shots, but if one hits, you can win a team fight.
1	Type: Targetted spell   Range: 550   Cooldown: 8s   Damage: 300 (+ 90% AP)   CC: Stun (1.5s)   Cost: 100 mana     vs     Type: Skillshot   Range: 1500   Cooldown: 6s   Damage: 230 (+ 65% AP) - 575 (+ 162.5% AP)   CC: -   Cost: 90 mana       Why bother taking a champ you have to get up close and personal with to mid/high damage early/midgame when you can pick the easier choice of safely spamming spears and traps from up to 1500 range, dealing up to twice the damage?   /
0	I agree to an extent. I think getting a new job simply for the sake of getting a new job "because I've been here for 5 years" (a reason I've heard a few people use before) is not a good reason in and of itself. If the job you're at provides you everything you need - new challenges, opportunity for growth and promotion, change in career path possibilities, etc. - I don't see a reason to leave, unless of course you're unhappy, or would simply like to experience a change of environment or the pace at a different company you're interested in.
1	Platinum Top Lane Nasus (kinda) main.   I never had any problems with any of those 4 champions, but judiging from how much I get supposedly counterpicked with these guys there seems to be some misconception.   First off: Anything that does entirely physical damage is generally a bad pick against Nasus unless he has sick armor shred/pen tools. Don't do it. Also, anything that has AoE and damages the wave in trades and pushes to Nasus' turret is also generally bad. If you combine both you get Riven and Renekton. Very popular picks that only work with a jungler ready to pick up your work and dive Nasus, which is the important part about shutting down Nasus.   Riven and Pantheon have no sustain and their entire damage is physical. Panth doesn't even have a combat ult. They will start losing  at level 6 to all-ins (panth) or 7-9ish (riven) due to sustain issues.   Shyvana is a decent pick, she can punish and dive him quite effecitvely with a jungler and she has mixed damage.   The best champs to punish Nasus are Kayle, Teemo, Irelia, Urgot and Vladimir. Ryze also works, so does Shen with MPen marks, glyphs and quints. Some of those picks are manageable by maxing E but they don't fall off too hard and do a good job of keeping him down for a while.   They have mixed/true damage and can do a lot of damage without pushing too hard plus they are hard to kill even with wither. Most of them are easily camped though so keep warding up, Wither plus Jungle CC is very hard to escape.   so,
1	Lee is an exceptionally excellent counter, although any champion with a strong lvl 1-5 duel potential will work. Burst is also rather good, as is cc.   Snare especially does wonders.     As a jungler valid counters are:   Lee   Khazix   Nocturne   Pantheon   Udyr   Vi   Wukong   >Your plan should be to take red level one and attempt to catch him at his second buff. Few champions are worse 1v1 at level two than Yi. Whether this is successful or not invest in a green ward or two and keep his jungle warded. One kill on him pays for 4 wards   Warwick gets a special mention, he can't really 1v1 yi but his ult can render a fed yi completely worthless.     As a top laner:   Ryze (Non-skillshot 1.5s snare on a low cooldown, build frozen heart)   Malphite (you destroy his AS and can counter his dives by ulting whoever he q's to)   Jax (you can 1v1 with counterstrike if you're even on items)   >As a top laner vs a jungle yi you should be able to safely exert a lot of pressure as long as you ward river. Depending on your communication and ELO you can organize counter ganks as well.     As mid just look for reliable burst and cc, things like:   Annie (if he doesn't dodge your AoE with q)   LeBlanc (double chains means you kite him hard)   Lux (if you can land snare he's dead)     As an adc you're at the whim of your team, but these champs could give you an edge:   Tristana (your ult can counter his initiate in teamfights and your w is a reliable escape as long as he's used his q)   Varus (the snare, if you can land it, can completely shut him down at any point on the game)   Vayne (if you have the mechanics to play her well just make sure you have ult before extending and fight him near a wall if you can. Counter his q with your condemn and kite him hard, 6 shots should kill nearly any yi)     Support (my domain of choice):   Thresh (If you can land a q onto yi he's done. Cast the q towards his target when he q's for a guaranteed hit. If he doesn't have his ult your kit also has two slows. Worst case scenario you gtfo and send your adc a lantern.)   Lulu (she's the counter-engage queen. You have whimsy to shutdown his damage and your ult and shield to mitigate it. Without his ult your q can render him immobile as well)   Braum (once you're 6 you have two reliable cc's for him to eat and a hard defense to put up for whoever his target is. Wait for him to q, while he's in midair jump to his target and spool up your ult so that it casts when he appears. While he's in the air either hit him with a q or an auto and your team should guarantee a stun. Without his ult you have hard peel with the slows+stun)   Leona (The other supports struggle with his ult negative their slows. Leona doesn't. When he uses his q just prime your zenith blade and jump onto him. Hit him with your q then immediately cast your ult on top of him, he won't be able to dodge it and your adc should be able to burst him with the help of your passive)
1	Not a Nasus main, but I think I can help a bit with it as I've got some friends that amined him a lot and played against the dog a lot of times.   I would personally recommend Urgot vs Nasus. You wreck him until levels 1-5, where you have to start playing a bit more careful (controlling minion positioning, timing his W and being aware of his ult and Q farm) and once he gets his ult he'll end up using it for trying to survive an EQQQ combo.   There are 2 ways that nasus will try to deal with you: 1) Still try to farm Q and max it, where it will probably become a free win for you or 2) he'll max E for pushing, getting some minions and farm Q in the jungle, where you will get free farm, and outscale him since he doesn't really have much to farm when the jungle is not his but still lets him become useful faster.   If you want more metalike solutions, I usually pick Lee Sin or Renekton for going all in early and snowballing for winning before Nasus becomes somehow strong. Other possibilities might be Vladimir (you're also weak early, but not like him and your range helps you to bully him since lvl1, even though you need a lot of warding to avoid early ganks) who scales pretty well into mid/late game (not as much as him, but you'll be stronger faster and bring up a lot of damage on teamfights while still being nearly as undying as him).   No matter what you do, don't push that fast his turret. Freeze the lane. Last hit and whenever he comes to take a single minion make sure he loses half his hp bar for it. Only push if you find out that your team needs you on teamfights, and still try to never let Nasus farm a single minion by going back to lane and freezing it when he's around.
1	Really, you need to keep him from all-in. If you can bait out his E before an engage, your jungler has a small window of opportunity to hank him very effectively and he also loses a good chunk of damage due to his passive.   You either farm to late game with an AD that out scales him or poke/out sustain him.
1	You can counter Nami with Leona. You can e+q to her. She is quite squishy even with health runes so looses direct contact. It's good to do engage after her w (heal/atack) and even better after she uses her q (buble). Her abilities have quite a lot of CD at first.
1	You want poke supports, but unless you're comfortable with Sona don't try her into this match up. Sona is a little UP still and to beat Morg you need to know your Q range like the back of your hand.   Instead I think the easiest match up is Karma for Morg. Karma beats Morg so hard, your poke is way too much. You can zyra too, but make sure you know how to position right, bc if she snares you in a bad spot you're dead. You can also play against her as Annie, and I personally find the match up easy , but you need to know how to bait her shield.
1	As Jungler: Counterjungle, shes pretty weak if she cant hit her charged q. Lee Sin is a pretty good choice for that. He can counterjungle and kill her and if u get cought u can easily escape. As Lane: Ward at the spots she can hit u with her q. When the enemy laner is able to kill u only with a Vi ult without her q then u should Ward a little more in the back that u can see her before she comes in range.
1	As someone that mains yi i can say that the 2 most annoying things to get through are stun and blind. Both if those make me completely useless. As a Master Yi i ALWAYS wait until most if not all the cc is used on the other people on my team before i go in and start the killing spree. It might be a bit different in higher elo but that strategy got me from bronze 5 to my current silver 2. I find that everyone in these elo are too uncoordinated.
1	I just I just recently started playing Lee Sin as a jungle main. I had to play against an Udyr who power farmed as usual and would come out for good ganks. It got to the point where he rushed Triforce and had Feral Flare already and he could just run out and chase everyone down. The only thing I can think of in this matchup is to try and gank hard while he farms and punish him for not helping as much. But if my ganks are unsuccessful then I'm stuck not scaling into late game while the enemy team kills my laners.   Any help here?
1	pick renekton, buy wards and go ham. Literally all you need to do lol. Jax is honestly my fav champ when i see him picked in ranked. I just pick renekton and i know for a fact he can't touch you in lane. Also bring ignite all in him lvl 3. Harass with powered q whenever he wants to farm and just stall it so it doesn't go near his turret. If he comes out you kill him.
1	DO NOT be afraid of his windwall if you are laning vs yasuo, it has a fairly long cooldown comparing to other abilities such as ziggs' or leblanc's q. Try baiting the windwall out and he is extremely vulnerable next trade. One more thing, if your jungler is ganking enemy yasuo, don't fool yourself of walking to close to him with squishy ap carries as vel'koz or above mentioned duo as he can/will try to attack and kill you due to his inability to escape the gank by just walking back to his turret.    Keep track of his e stacks as it has a huge impact in early/mid trades.   I have the most problems against yasuo when I play Draven, as the axes don't bounce off the wall so beware of that in teamfights. As kiting yasuo, remember not to walk near your minions because he will use them to dash to you. Try taking advantage of yasuo's pushing/overextending and trying to all-in you all the time.
1	I think a lot of people aren't suggesting the best counter pick. Ryze is very good against renekton in lane because he can completely nullify all-ins by using his rune prison. Not only that but he can also consistently poke renekton down after getting tear. The only true threat a Renekton poses to a Ryze is the fact that he can set up really good ganks on Ryze since he has a gap closer and stun and Ryze can only use his rune prison on one person. Eventually as the game goes on, if you are playing Ryze and you manage to make it to late game, regardless of winning lane or not, you will be much more useful than him since you can wipe out his team and provide a good frontline while all he does is soak damage.   If you are not confident in being able to play the Ryze vs. Renekton matchup I would suggest picking people who can go relatively even in lane while still being able to have good impacts in the game. Champions such as Shyvana, Lee Sin, Munco and Trundle are usually able to lane vs a Renekton without giving up free kills or being massively outfarmed and pretty much all of them are more useful in the later parts of the game as well (Lee is more or less dependant on your mechanics with him).   I used to main renekton but I really think he just falls off too hard compared to the really good late game tanks and bruisers and this is what you usually want to use to your advantage.
1	Hope you don't mind me disagreeing, but a under her tower leona is a lot more useful than a close tou your tower leona. The stun lock all-in potential is awesome for a lane gank of the jungler, since leo can keep the opposing adc locked enough time for the vi/lee/elise/fiddle/xin to get there. when she is close to your turret, UNLESS their far ahead enough for a SoloQ uncoordinated dive [in that case, your lane's lost anyway], she is useless since she can't use CC on you. I like to freeze up the lane near my turret or at maximum in the middle of the lane, so my supp can: 1- Harass her 2- Be able to push out the other adc if she all-ins and making enemy adc have a hard time running away 3- help me run to my on turret and sustain back. [depending on the support picked].
1	He's really not all that hard.. he's got an extremely high skill-ceiling, but learning him isn't very hard. He's also one of the best jungle picks in the meta. After 5 or 6 games, you get the hang of him, just like any other champ.   If you do try to learn him, remember that you  don't  have to be flashy. You  don't  have to make big Insec plays, and you  won't  land every Q. He's an intimidating champion but don't let the fact that he can be very mechanically intensive scare you away from playing him.
1	I don't really rate this idea as Rammus, he's not a bad jungler but i don't really see how he counters yi more than other options.   The rammus would have to out gank the yi for the most part because his clears so poor that yi would snowball ahead if his ganks aren't sucessful or rammus just afk farms. Also rammus can't invade yi very successfully. - this makes you better off with more agressive junglers who can both gank a lot early to snowball and invade yi. (lee singha and elise).   Also if yi gets ahead theres very little rammus can do to stop him, his taunt only does so much and rammus also needs the taunt for engage, which won't work on a yi with ghostblade, ruinking items. Yi is much more vulnerable to displacement, such as alistar and lee sin.   Then dueling potential when yi splitpushes, rammus can't deal with this either. Unless the rammus is fed as hell he wont duel the yi because he doesnt have the damage to capitalise on his cc. Jax and irelia do this nicely.
1	Actually lucian has no chance to survive 1v1 against a decently farmed xin with youmuus if he manages to dash to you. You really need your support to peel for you while you kill him, or at least have flash to get away.   Your dash is so small that the slow from his E + the movement speed from youmuu's allows him to close the gap you create with your dash and then get off his third Q, at which point you are most likely dead.
1	Pantheon main here. Pantheon in the early stages is extremely reliant on mana, you can take advantage of this buy buying early sustain such as, cloth 5 or crystalline flask, this will quickly run him out of mana. After this you want to build a armour item such as sun fire cape, after that you can build some damage or more tank depending on your champ and who's winning. When I play pantheon I find my hardest counters are Shen, Chogath, Malphite, Udyr. They absolutely crush me, the worst being Shen.
1	Leona has a few problems, her main problem being that Morgana and Thresh are super popular right now. Leona's other problem is that she is a super all-in champion: Once you go in, you are in and committed and you have no good inherent escape in case you get ganked or you made a mistake.   Morgana's spellshield makes Leona much more useless and (if somewhat good) forces Leona to be much more creative with her playing. All Morgana has to do is spellshield whoever Leona E's on and Leona can't do much to that person anymore.   Thresh, while not quite as big an annoyance as Morgana, can (depending on how good he is) flay Leona's e, effectively denying and stopping Leona's gapcloser and prevent Leona from getting close enough to do anything else. This of course gets a bit better at lvl 6 when Leona gets ult.   Zyra has been nerfed a good amount from before. She's still an amazing counter-engager with her ult but she is very squishy and dies if caught by pretty much anything. She does offer good poke though, still.   Annie support has been nerfed considerably since her glory days. Her passive stun now scales with levels (so it is weaker and stuns for much less at early levels) and the base damage of all her damage abilities have been lowered but she has better scaling (to weaken Annie support and strengthen Ap carry Annie). As a result, Annie is much less of a dominant early-mid game support.   I am not an AD main so the ADC stuff is just what I've observed/ believe   I actually see some Ezreals still and a few Graves every now and then. Ezreal's problem is that he needs to land his q to be effective (which has always been his problem) but Lucian and Twitch just seem to do so much more. I actually don't think Graves is that bad, he's kind of like a different Lucian. Graves is really more of an ad caster than an ADC with how his kit works, but he has to get pretty close and personal most of the time. With the safety/utility of Lucian and the pressure/assassination potential from Twitch, I assume Graves is just less useful.   Lucian is incredibly dominant early game and a great duelist/trader. A good Lucian can make a lot happen and he can still do damage from pretty far away with his ult. Lucian has an annoying amount of safety with his dash and the range of his ult. Twitch is pretty much an adc assassin that creates pressure when he can't be seen. He pops out of nowhere and bursts a squishy down with his ambush bonus, botrk, and ult. Most other ad carries lose pressure when they can't be seen on the map, but twitch actually gains pressure as long as he keeps making himself felt in the game.   As for Ryze, he is usually played top lane as a counter to most top laners because Ryze is really good at punshing and zoning most melee top laners (and guess what kind of top laners are popular right now). As a bonus he'll also usually end up scaling to lategame better than his top counterpart as well.
1	I mained Miss Fortune in Season 2 but stopped playing her from Season 3 onwards, not just because there were better ADCs out there that could do what she could do, but also because her strengths just doesn't help to cover her weaknesses.   Her Q has decent damage but most Miss Fortune players will try to hit you with the second shot instead of the first, avoid this by constantly moving when you're behind minions, the second shot is less likely to hit you that way if the second shot can't "lock" onto you to hit you.   Her ult is powerful, but almost any support nowadays is able to stop it instantly - Leona stuns, Thresh flay/hook, Nami bubble, Braum shield. If you're against Miss Fortune, ask for a support (or even PLAY as a support) that has the CC capability to stop her ult.   Speaking of CC capability, Miss Fortune only has one soft CC - her E, the AoE slow. It's good for waveclear but doesn't offer her much escape potential. Usually Miss Fortunes will rather turn and kill you instead of trying to get out. As long as you keep attacking her to avoid her passive from coming up, and stop her ult damage, it's relatively easy to beat her.
1	Leona in lane hits 3 powerspikes at levels 2, 3, and 6.   For the first spike, what this means is you need to hard push your lane and hit level 2 earlier than leona does. If she zenith/stuns you while you're only level 1, it will at the very least, burn you through your pots, and then she's just going to all in you again once off cd.   If you hit level 2 first, try and all in her. If you at least burn leona or her ADC down to half health and keep them there, she definitely won't go in on you before she has shield, and even when she gets it, she'll still play passive until it's stronger when she hits levels 4-5.   If both lanes are relatively equal, you need to keep her bush warded starting the minion before she hits 3 so you can keep an eye on her. A full QWE combo out of the bush with an ADC that can proc all 3 passives could probably kill you, or send you out of lane and start it snowballing away from you.   Understand that leona is all-in with 0 sustain. That's it. Which means if she can't all in you because she's or her ADC are lower in health, abuse them and don't give them time to recover. In line with that, If leona  does  all in you, watch how many of her passives the opposing ADC procs. If they're synced enough that they pop all three, GTFO. If the ADC is late following up and only one gets popped, Switch the aggression around. Those passive procs account for a bit of leonas threat, and if the ADC misses 2/3 of them, thats 70-100 damage they missed out on. Now, if you and your supp go ham on the other adc since leona no longer has any peel or burst, you may actually come out ahead. Just remember, leona's combo is ~10s cd. If you're still skirmishing when that comes off, it will turn the fight back around.   Be aware, if you're in range to AA Leona (unless cait/kog/trist), she can probably get a zenith blade off onto you. Its best to harass her with skillshots if you can, and only with AA's with your supports skills off CD in case she all-ins you.   When Leona hits 6, she  will  go all in on you. Do not stay in lane without your support. Do not count on your tower saving you. Giving up some CS/XP/Tower to wait for jungle/support so you don't die is far better than giving up all 3 + a kill. The Range on her ult is approximately 3/4 of a screen away, so even if you think you're safe, you're probably not. At 6, If you can see her on your screen, she's a threat.   Ultimately though, Leona isn't countered by ADC's. The other support is what shuts down Leona. I climbed from low silver to Gold 1 (Plat soon, hopefully) on leona's back, and the only time I really had problems was seeing a Janna or Ali on the other team. A good Janna will ruin Leona's world, and I mean shit all over it like a puppy with diarrhea. Ali will make Leona second-guess every all in since she requires her adc to follow up. An Ali headbutting away the enemy adc when Leona goes in just leaves a stuck Leona getting beaten in the face.   After Lane phase is over, you need to make Banshee's Veil a priority. I  will  aim for you with R. If I hit it, the team is coming for you. Know that.   And this is just advice for all champs in general, but if leona is behind, she has a really hard time catching up. If she can't survive going all in, then most of her usefulness to the team if negated.
1	Go hard before level 3. His level 1 is weak as all hell - either he takes flip and does virtually no damage beyond that, or takes Q and will struggle to so much as farm because he has no displacement to escape. At level 2, he takes the other, but still won't have the damage or speed to really do anything. This is the point where you should look to call for ganks and start shutting him out. By level 3, his second rank in Q may just be enough to start really chipping away at your health. A champion with quick dashes to recover from the flip's displacement may be helpful as well. Also, keep in mind that any champion with a skill that makes them targetable will still take ticks of poison in those frames if it's already been applied. It won't go through invulnerabilities, however.
1	I mean, 1. ghost and heal are very good summoner spells in dominion as is upgrading boots considering that as a general rule, movement speed dominates dominion.     moving as a group is not as uncommon as normal's or ranked since there are no real "lanes" you win by taking and holding towers, so do whatever is working to win. Can't explain them having the bear claw icon, except that on occasion I will see everyone (myself included) with that icon while loading for a game. Idk if It's a bug or what, but it happens.  Basically I'm playing Devils advocate here and saying that this is circumstantial, There is evidence that these could be bots, but there is reasonable doubt that they are not.  More of what I've seen from bots are a ton of losses, the same build every time, and most will follow a player. I don't see that from the lolking that you posted.
1	Quinn is a stronger adc than nidalee, nidalee is a very weak adc lol.   Nid in human form doesn't have AD scalings. So she has her spear, AP scaling poke ability, W, AP scaling trap (multiple uses, not really useful to throwdown in the middle of fights though), and a decent heal/AS Buff, that scales with AP. So you have very minor damage through your damaging abilities (since you don't build AP to scale them), and a heal/AS buff, basically leaving your entire damage output to your AUTOATTACKS.   If you want to have a purely auto attacking champion, why not play Caitlyn, Jinx, Trist, etc?   Quinn scales with AD, has a strong AD scaling Aoe damaging blind (extremely useful when timed right), W granting vision of the fight, preventing further flanks/escapes, and her E, Great damage, especially when combined with her passive. Going bird form isn't really meant for 5v5 teamfights (it's more meant for escaping/chasing down other champions after skirmishes and to increase duel potential), so we'll leave that out of the discussion.
0	When you figure out what the laws are in the state you are in where the recording took place and it is a one party consent to record state, make sure you check that the state you are divorcing in will recognize that recording if they are a 2 party state.   I am not a lawyer, but I like to dot my i's and t's.  So check with your lawyer and maybe call a few in your home state and just ask on the phone and see if anyone will answer the question.  maybe  get a few confirmations or even retain a lawyer in the home state... or the whole situation in reverse states depending on how your lawyer/situation is.
0	Unfortunately just about every state in the US has pretty strict doctor-patient confidentiality laws. There is no way in hell your therapist would be allowed to testify or reveal anything she said to him/her.   Have you actually discussed this matter with your lawyer? I think you're heading for a rude awakening. If you don't live in a 1-party state the recording won't be admissible. Even if that's not the case, the fact she cheated on you doesn't actually matter. To date, there is no case law that specifically addresses adultery. But the law is very clear that alimony awards have to be based on what is 'just', which means taking into account the obligee's ability to support themselves and the obligor's ability to pay, and that fault can't be considered. Judges have to write alimony orders "without regard to misconduct." This means that the family court can't consider any kind of fault or marital misconduct, including adultery, when it makes decisions about alimony.   What will happen is the family court will want you two to work out an agreement, if you can't come to one the judge will look over all the pertinent information (financial obligations held by either party, standard of living during the marriage, length of marriage, etc). The judge will then determine how much and how long you will have to pay. The goal in the judges decision will be to achieve approximate equality.
1	Can I reference this brilliant Youtube Video from Extra Credits in terms of how 129 champions is actually helping the balance of the game. It's really important as a Game Designer to understand this concept.   EDIT 1: Importantly, it labels how giving the players a wealth of options (129 champions) actually keeps the meta fresh and equips the player base to solve meta problems.
1	Damn, this reflects the situation perfectly! You need more upvotes. It seems like Riot is buffing champions that are easy to play and don't have big "Play-potential" to the point the user just needs to smash his head on the keyboard to win lane/game. I'm looking at champions like: Caitlyn, Nasus, Vel'Koz, Kayle, Lulu... Note that I'm not here to highlight the champs with the highest winratio but the champs that that have way too high effectiveness compared to the actual knowledge and skill you need to play it properly.   Additionally, there are many champs that are deemed skill instensive even tho they aren't. Zed being a perfect example. Having such a good waveclear and all that extra damage for nothing makes him a very easy champ. The difference between a good Zed and a horrible Zed is basicly, that the horrible Zed will MAYBE die after he assassinated the ADC, APC and the other has some more knowledge and even survive the 1v5 dive onto the ADC...   Riot keeps constantly nerfing play-making champs and to be honest it sucks. I would bet a 975 skin one of the next nerfs goes to Katarina. The worst part of it all is the community riding every bandwagon that they are presented. That's actually WHY the community is fucked up. I don't care about toxic kids and heck I'll use strong words when I'm settled up, if someone reports me, well fuck it I report back, cause everyone has a corpse in his cellar. Maybe they didn't flame me directly but I'm sure they did, it's fucking human to do so.
1	He's not. What he's doing is asking them to redirect some of their current trying-to-make-the-game-better-efforts to balancing champions outside of the top tiers.
1	Noone considers lion a weak hero and he is certainly viable and pickable. Io was nerfed(but not overnerfed) and it never had 100% win ratio. So instead of pulling numbers out of our ass, let's talk with actual data from the international 4 qualifiers   244 games, 98 heroes picked out of 103(+4 who arent available for captain's mode because they are new). Io was picked in 31 games(it doesnt show bans though) and had 35.5% win ratio. 35.5% win ratio? My god, Io must suck, it definitely needs a buff /s   Lion was picked in 6 games and has 50% win ratio. Obviously io is more popular than lion but that doesnt mean that it is better. It is just a completely different support hero.   What is strongest, making your carry(and yourself) take 20% less dmg+attack speed, root enemies and being able to teleport yourself+carry anywhere on the map? Or having 2 insane cc(one of which is aoe line) and one nuke that literally 1shots heroes? Both heroes are extremely strong in their own way.
1	Just because a champ gets strong doesn't mean people are sheep. This game is complex and the meta shifts to favor certain play-styles.   Ex: TF has seen a large resurgence since some fairly minor buffs. Was he OP all along? No, the meta just shifted to favor laners who have strong waveclear and utility. Late season 3, the meta favored assassins in mid-lane such as Zed and Ahri who had very easy time against him in lane and in teamfights.
1	YEAH RIOT WHY CAN'T YOU MAKE SURE ALL 120 CHAMPS ARE COMPLETELY BALANCED? Oh wait, because that's literally impossible. If we're talking about viability almost every single champion in this game is viable for solo queue which is primarily what the game is balanced around. What is viable in the pro scene is not at all indicative of what's viable in solo queue. Pros only play top tier champs because they are playing at the highest level and need every single advantage they can get. Those champs that are always picked in pro play also are the ones that fit the current meta/team comps people are running because the strategy in those games is completely different. Even if the pro players themselves that do these strategies in LCS tried to do it in soloqueue with all challenger team mates it many of the strats would fail almost every time due to a lack of coordination by the team. Last season I went from Bronze 1 to Gold V in little over a week with Wukong mid at a time when almost NO ONE was playing that. At the time Nightblue himself had said he felt Wu was a better mid than top but still no one played it because it wasn't FoTM and it wasn't getting play in LCS.
1	This is the defining characteristic of Moba vs MMO games though. If you want to truly have no idea go play World of Warcraft, there's 11 classes. 11 options. That's as large of a pool as can be created where in a free for all melee things are level and there is no tier system it's just fire beats water, water beats leaf, leaf beats fire kind of shit.   If your dislike pokemon gameplay and WoW, then play League of Legends where shit's crazy as fuck, there is tiering, there is OP shit, there is underpowered shit, there is amazing plays, there is sweat under your arms after 40 minutes of turrent siege. If it's too much for you to handle, then go play the game where 0.2s actually doesn't matter because you can just polymorph someone for 8s, then silence them for another 4s, then cyclone them for another 8s, then root them for 3s, then re-polymorph them for 4s and so on and so forth.
1	In general, i would Agree with "this guy" on the issue that there are in fact, more than 20 champions in the game yet only those tier1s are seeing the most plays. BUT! i believe this problem to be somewhat limited to the LCS/Challenger (and their publicity) and somewhat Diamond and the Skilllevel that can be found up there, everything below this its more "monkey see monkey do" than anything and has nothing to do with "this champion beats that champion".   Let me Explain.   Champions are like tools/Equipment for those players, they use them in a way and max out their potential to the limits (and sometimes beyond, aka CDR/AP Tryn ololol). These people are so good in this game that in fact, it matters to them those little margins one champion beats another. They can use those advantages. Its like 2 F1 Racecars, one carbon, the other "less" carbon, or a brandname Drill (Bosch Blue f.e) vs. a Storebrand, or even   Now give those Tools to the gold/silver/bronze/whatever 24/7 casual dimwit, and the pro a potato, and he will most likely still wipe the floor with that dimwit up and down every lane on the rift. this holds true to lower elos as well imo.   If your skill increases, your champion pool will either increase, or at least specialize, you will rise, and meet better people and then, at some point that most of us here will never ever ever reach (numbers dont lie, theres like 1 or 2% of the total playerbase competing for chal/dia) it might matter that you pick that Tier1 Champion rather than that below tier1 champion, until then -  doesn't matter had fun .   The entire argument that "champion X is better than Y" holds only true if you meet equally  high  skilled people where it acutally matters. Tier1 champs in lower elo dont contribute as much to the victory as most of us would believe.   Yes there is a lot more to the whole, but i believe it boils down to a few key things, on of which is:
1	We don't.
1	Apparently something that is not funny for  you  anymore is not funny for anyone at all.
1	i think gaming is still a little too young (at least in the west) to have much if any psychiatrists but maybe soon as the generation comming now is filled with gamers, i know some nurses and such that play league though, but for me personally i think its made me better, i used to be a person that thought i couldnt get anywhere in life because of other people/situations when i seriously started wanting to learn this game first thing i learned was the reason i cant win is because of myself. At first i only applied that to this game still hating my life and things that happened in it but once that concept really sunk in i realised it just didnt apply to this game but to basicly everything, nothing is completely out of your control (maybe only some genetic things.. maybe) and if theres something wrong with my life its cause im directly not actively trying to improve/change it so i feel league helped improved my mental state a great deal and my life has been going on a far better track then it had been before i played league
0	I live in a small town and almost nothing is done about legitimate crimes in the area. Even so, the local police set up speed traps everywhere, make arbitrary stops at a moment's notice, and write catalogs of minor tickets to be paid by an unsuspecting class of otherwise law-abiding citizens. Our roads are dangerously deteriorating and major crimes, but our men in blue always have the newest, professionally-tuned squad cars for "proactive law enforcement."   Rant time: A close acquaintance of mine used to live across the street from a deputy. She told me that she heard screaming outside her house one night and saw a woman running over to the deputy's house for help (I forget if it was robbery or sexual assault, but she was in dire need of assistance nevertheless). However, as she was crying for help and banging on the man's door, he refused to answer and gestured through the window for her to leave. Nothing was done about the crime following the event. Furthermore, one of the same houses on the block was--is--known to be a drop house, but the police force has done nothing to interfere. I personally have witnessed the lethargic sense of justice. Earlier this year, my car was robbed in one of the area's many rough neighborhoods. There were multiple witnesses who saw the event and could identify the person and even gave his name to the officer filing the report. No results or punishment then or since.
0	This is just full of bullshit. As a traffic collision investigator I can assure you that speeding is most defiantly a factor in most collisions. The reason behind this is reaction distance and slide to stop ratios. The faster you go the longer you travel before your foot hits the brakes.   Signs are placed adequate distances for the  gasp  speed limit reactions!!! Who would have guessed! Part of our job is to ensure that those signs are set up so that people can adequately react as opposed to the engineers that set them up. If traffic patterns show a certain area is high on crashes we are sent to investigate why. Sometimes a patrol car is all that is needed to stop people from speeding. Less speed means better reaction distance and, you guessed it, less crashes.   Fear of apprehension outweighs the fear of the penalty in 75% of cases of people.
0	Stupid? Now if someone told her beforehand and she did it anyway, that's stupid. But not knowing beforehand? That's ignorance not stupidity. You can't get mad at someone for being ignorant because they don't usually have control over it. I never knew tattoo's like that were a thing in the holocaust until this thread. You calling her stupid is similar to calling me stupid. Are you saying that I'm stupid because I've never come across this before? No one ever told me about it and I can't do research on something I don't know about.
1	It seems for you that you are doing bad, because subconsciously you have a high standard for yourself. So even if you are doing good, you can still think you are doing bad. It's like people who think that everyone hates them, even though no one even cares.
1	You're starting to get it!   Get what? you cut out a huge portion of the sentence and the following sentence which made the clear point that different champions are stronger/weaker in the meta. In certain other games, the characters/champions are more balanced so every pick serves a specific purpose. League of Legends is not like that. Compare Lux to Ziggs. Ziggs is safer, has more damage over time, has more burst damage, deals more damage to structures, can global clear, can permawaveclear. What does Lux do significantly better than Ziggs? Almost nothing. Which is why Ziggs is played over her.   >Or they're scared to try things that haven't proved to work. Either way, its NOT similar to soloq, at all.   A pro team, in its combined players, probably has over 10,000 games played. Do you think they haven't tried almost everything at least once? Do you think that their coaching staff and analysts have no idea what they're doing? In a competitive meta with competent junglers, higher degree of vision control, and greater team coordination certain picks will be stronger there than in soloque. However, it's still the same game. If Kassadin is super strong in competitive games it's likely that he's strong in soloq games as well. At Gold and below, hell even plat, any pick is viable. But once you get high enough up the ladder, one is only handicapping themselves by playing champions that are significantly weaker than meta champions. If one is extremely good on a champion or it's a hidden OP then yeah it's a great idea to play it. But most players, who don't have a main champion, will perform best using the meta champions.   >No, it couldn't   As I mentioned, and you cut out of your quotation, winrate does not always equal champion popularity. For example, pre-rework Xerath. However, if a champion is majorly terrible, like post-rework Skarner, it will lose popularity because players don't usually like playing champions that don't win games when played well. It's not a perfect correlation between popularity and winrate but the champions with much higher winrates get played more than champions with very low winrates.   >Yes, they are. You WILL NEVER play against someone of exactly equal skill, ever. The pros are so close to each other in terms of mechanical skill and game sense, so they might have a problem playing Ashe or Quinn. You will never have that problem. If you have more games on Ashe/Quinn than Draven/Jinx, THEN THEY'RE THE BETTER/STRONGER PICKS, every single time.   Once again, a logical fallacy. Sure, if you have played twice as many games on a champion you are more comfortable there and will perform better than a champion you are uncomfortable with. However, one cannot ignore the fact that, if they played a stronger pick just as much, they could've been performing EVEN BETTER than on their comfort champion. Pros do have more equal skill levels than the average soloq game, but if a champion is completely broken then the average player can abuse it just as much as a pro player.   Tell me, why do I have 3x as many games played on Zed, TF, and Nidalee but all of them have 30% less winrate than my Kassadin? Because Kassadin is a patently stronger pick, not because I play it better. I know far more/am more comfortable playing Zed/TF/Nidalee than Kassadin, yet my Kassadin winrate is super high. Clearly there are different tiers of champions, however, I'm not advocating to only play those champions.   If one enjoys playing the champion, then go ahead and play it. In soloq, there's a bonus edge that a player has by playing an uncommon champion. Like how everyone assumes Poppy is terrible then get bursted down going "where the fuck did that come from?" But that champion might not be as powerful as a meta champion. For example, compare Gangplank and Lulu top. Is there anything Gangplank does significantly better than Lulu? Except for providing global ult support, there's nothing. Lulu has more damage, utility, range, safety, and can better utilize teleport. If one wants to win, one should always pick Lulu over Gangplank unless you have never played Lulu before and Gangplank you have 100x as much experience.
1	Reddit a few weeks ago: Lucian is OP he dominates all the scene for AD Carries and he excels at literally everything   Riot: How about we nerf him then and make his range lower, that seems reasonable enough and to compensate we can make him even more ability based with lower cooldowns, more chase potential and lower mana costs   Reddit: OMG RITO RIP LUCIAN   Get a grip guys. You aint playing in the LCS, you can play any adc. If you truly enjoy the champion dont go being pissy because they got nerfed and just play your champion anyways. If there's people still playing Jayce, Zac, Cho etc. You can still play an ADC who's tentative nerfs could be way worse. This new cooldown and cooldown reduction for Lucian's dash might even make him actually have powerspikes rather than be good all the time, as he could end up having much more interesting combo's in lane that are much better early game. Sure, range nerfs are HUGE but they've given him decent stuff to compensate, from a trading standpoint he isnt that worse off and mid-late game he has the ability to reposition more frequently each fight making him hard to dive on as a bruiser. I understand Seraph's POV on this, but only as he plays at high elo. 90% of you guys are Bronze or Silver just like me, That's just common knowledge, and if you truly enjoy Lucian and main him like you say just fucking play him. The advantages at low elo from straight outplay far outweigh those from champion strength and none of you have even tried Lucian after these nerfs, why jump to conclusions?
1	No it isn't dude. Play more games and it'll move to 50%. Also are you climbing consistently? Or are you playing people at your skill level? Last season, i had 666 AP nidalee games, 51.8% winrate. 95 games on OLD yasuo 51.6% winrate. YOU WILL get about 50% winnrate always, when playing at your skill level (And more than 10 goddamn games).   At the time I had a 47% winrate, I was not climbing the ladder. When I get to around 30 games on a champion it's usually a 60% winrate. The point is, stronger champions tend to have higher winrate.   >No, they never do that.   Here is Phreak using winrate as an indicator of power level.  By saying "winrate doesn't mean everything," he's clearly indicating it means something. Otherwise he would've said "winrate means nothing."   Here is Meddler talking about differing champion power levels, clearly indicating that they exist and can affect regular players.
1	Wow this coomunity is stupid as hell. Ofcourse if you invent something you want the recognition for it. Even if he/she don't deserve to get money, or the champion taken out of the game, he/she still deserves to be recognised as the inventor or whatever you call it.  I get mad reading these stupid comments about OP stealing the idea from dota, or that even if he/she came up with the idea there is no point of mentioning it. I've thought of things hundreds of times that I thought was original only to find that people have thought of it before me, it was still an original idea for me, even though someone got to it before me. If I was a part of making a movie I would be in the credits no matter how small the my part was, same with making games.
1	You are so right and after the game complaining on social media...it's like Brasil complaining that Germany scored them 7 goals of course a team won't hesistate to destroy you if you let them the chance...there aren't only ponies and candies out there. The real world is harsh.
0	I do too and a lot of fucked up stuff that I've  is because I hit the arrow by mistake. Then I try to overcompensate by downvoting. But then I feel bad about that so I re-upvote. And I end up accidentally liking some awful stuff I never meant to like.
1	Thats true, but in my experience there are always people who can speak English with varying degrees of fluency in games on euw, even the people who dont speak English are able to say something along the lines of 'sry I not speak English' whereas eune, the best you'll get is 'lucker dog' and the occasional 'I fuck your mother'.
1	Honestly some people are going to tell you to try to carry the game with "carry" champs or "practice more". After climbing to high plat on multiple accounts the one thing i'm sure of is that every low elo player underestimates the power of TEAMWORK. I know this is the cheesy answer and it's easier said than done, but one day you will look back when you're gold/plat and realize the insane amounts of selfish decisions you made at low elo and how they seemed like a good idea at the time but in reality they cause you to lose.   When you are playing try to consciously think of what you should be doing as a TEAM! Always act as a team, try not to react to the other team (especially when you are ahead).   Also I realize that a lot of the time it's hard to work as a team when your teammates don't want to, but if you personally work on it, that's the biggest thing to set you apart from other low elo players, and mechanics are important too but that just comes with time.   Sorry if this post is really sloppily formatted I just threw it together real quick, hope I could help.
1	By demanding "1080p", what you really mean is increasing the bitrate, not resolution. Imagine an 8K video at 100 kbps and a 720p video at 10,000 kbps. Do you really want the "8K" over 720p? It shows that resolution alone means nothing. Same thing goes for 60fps. If you maintained the bandwidth, you'd half the quality of a 30fps video when you double it to 60fps. Enjoy that smooth video of pixelation. So it's bandwidth that you want.   So you're talking about a 8x increase in bandwidth (when scaling up bitrate), which is huge for the likes of Twitch. 1080p has 4x the area of 720p so that's 4x the bitrate, and 30fps to 60fps doubles the bandwidth to 8x. That's equivalent of providing a stream to 8 million people instead of 1 million.   You have to scale up bitrate (the video detail after compression) and not only the resolution because a simple upscale from 720p to 1080p without increasing the bitrate won't give any improvements (it's what your PC already does when you view 720p fullscreen on a 1080p monitor). You could also increase the bitrate 4x on a 720p stream and it will be upscaled it to 1080p with much more detail.
0	My UBC experience was deeply rooted in several different faculties/departments that all addressed gender in some societal function or problematization. Even after reading countless hours of Judith Butler and other academics who research gender binaries and gender performativity and power, my biggest issue comes from acting the perspective of a humanist.   I feel like I'm thinking "wrongly" for my opinions on gender issues as less important than decolonialization, the progress and survival of our species, and technological and scientific advances, despite finding myself parroting the "eliminate the gender binary" ideal that humanism often supports.   This isn't to shut down gender privilege as an issue to be fixed or addressed, but to acknowledge that the different waves of feminism and varying beliefs in social justice movements all link back to these macro-scale ideas at their roots, and often leave people out of the equality narrative, eapecially those of genderqueer, null/asexual, and transexual identities ALREADY, leading to a need for a generalist equality movement that doesn't alienate anyone, and is wholly inclusive of diversity.
0	Me and my wife tried something like this.  I busted into the bedroom and started at it then she went, "no, stop." So I did.  She looked at me funny and asked why I stopped.  Apparently, "Because you told me to," was not the right answer.   We never tried it again and we still laugh about it now and then.
0	Clearly you've never been punched in the eye, otherwise you would know you can't see shit after getting punched.
0	my best friend from like 3rd grade until 11th became this person. he was that one friend you had that you would always be with, always staying at each others houses, learning to skateboard, making stupid videos, seriously everything. for christ sake our birthdays are like a week apart. but he branched off with "the cool kids" while i stayed with the "misfits." i wasnt cool for not drinking, and smoking cigs, partying hard, whatever was cool then. so we started to lose touch with each other, especially once we got our driving license. he actually began to hate on me which hurt the worst and just became a huge prick. about a year after we all had graduated, i was with some friends who were also his friends prior, get this call and its him wanting to hangout, it was like 1am, and he comes overs. at first it was great catching up, playing videos games, talking about chicks, anyways, he starts talking about "the cool kids" and how he is fighting with them and there was no one else to hangout with. so in a last ditch effort he called us and we were nice enough to let him come over thinking he finally grew up or something and wanted to actually hang out with us. nope. after that night i never saw him again, we lived in the same town until i moved away when i was 22. it still hurts today knowing i had this great friend who became a giant dick :(
0	The same thing happened to me in 6th grade.  Our teacher would give is "tickets" for certain things, and I found a way to game the system and ended up with a fuckton of tickets.  I was going to McDonald's (Lunch at McD was a redeemable option) like a pimp.   Towards the end of the year we had this auction-like event where we could use our tickets to buy prizes.  This girl, Kelly, pretended to like me and I had a huge crush on her, so I bought this super nice bubble set for her with my tickets.   Then at recess, she gave the set to Stephen, this boy she liked, and they were playing with them.  I tried to join in because I wanted to be with her, and she told me I couldn't, which broke my little 6th grade heart.
0	In some states, yes. However, those laws were originally intended to protect women who had been promised marriage (I.e. were engaged)  under the coverture doctrines and had already begun the process of combining estates. In the end, the likely outcome would be a shrug from the judge unless you could prove in writing that the initial intent was deception for profit, in which case it would be a slam dunk.   Edit:
1	OK people need to stop hating on Wickd, his champion pool actually isnt that small perhaps his kayle games at worlds was last luckluster, but he seems to be able to play it well in EU LCS as he has won the two games he played her in   more or less, his main focus with kayle was to counter the ryze, as his other champions cant counter ryze, therefore went kayle top again to try and counter the ryze but got wrecked by elise's ganks therefore never really executed what he wanted to do with kayle   if maokai or irelia were up, he would have probably used them but guess what, both were banned wickd's champion pool is where, the only meta top laner he does not play, is ryze he has played a lot of other champions, but irelia has always been his strongest champ and since it is in the meta, why not pick it   if froggen's anivia was in the meta right now, i am pretty sure froggen would continue to pick it   waht he couldve gone however, is lulu, if you havent noticed, he has played it a lot at eu summer split, also with it, he would actually make the team comp, idk not suck?
1	I think more emphasis needs to be added on how much of an underdog KaBum was this game. Alliance is the #1 team out of Europe, said by many to be the West's only chance against the mighty Korean teams in terms of winning the whole tournament. KaBum is a team from Brazil, which has a small but developing League professional scene. KaBum was not even the clear favorite to make it out of their region, let alone take down a prominent team in the World's tournament. Alliance also had recently beaten NaJin White Shield, a Korean team favored by many to make it to the finals, extremely convincingly.   There was a fair amount of controversy as to whether these wild card teams from weaker regions should be even allowed in the tournament, as they are easily defeated by the superior regions. KaBum's win puts Alliance at a record of 3-3, and placing them volatile to being knocked out of the group stages.
0	Too bad those girls start off with mixed messages then.  You both liked each other. So if you're not actually interested, remove him and/or tell him as much.
1	I don't care about the meta but if you want an immobile skillshot midlane mage vel is an awesome choice. I feel like his passive really shines in the support role however as it makes him a non-item dependant mage. Even with only frost queen's claim and support items he will become a damage threat with his true damage passive. Late game throw in a Liandry's Torment to counter health stacking which counters true damage and no matter what you'll be doing tons of damage. He has good synergy with champions like MF when he supports not only because of the wombo combo ults but because of the amazing harrass he provides to supplement MF's lane bully nature.
1	I hate how every time a pro player or any public figure posts a text there's always a retarded biased wrong

1	heres the deal:   racism is a VERY subjective term, and there are varying degrees of it.   >Who's fault was it that Svenskeren got banned 3 games? Svenskerens alone, 110%, one of the dumbest things anyone has ever done in E-sport history.   this is the critical part i disagree with.   i dont think jeziz actively blamed svenskerren. i think he knows something about svenskeren most of us dont know or dont want to see. based on previous SK posts/intervieews on the subject and on this one, i think svenskeren really didnt know what he was doing in the situation. he was acting stupidly, in my eyes, not neccessarily racist.   thats what i didnt want to get into. cause i know how reddit sees this whole thing. "you said something bad about this type of people, and we know you are toxic from soloq? why you must be a racist!"   i have a somewhat different view, as i elaborated above.   dreadmad is an idiot if he actually thinks that his "
1	Hello guys, I've been wanting to write a statement of my performance at Worlds 2014 and I think I've expressed myself the best way possible.   So first off, I wanna talk about my performance at Summer Playoffs as this leads up to the Korean bootcamp and my Worlds performance.   I believe i was at 50% of my full potential at that time, with a lot of confidence backing me up. As we went to Seoul in Korea for bootcamp, I reached about 70% of my potential. I improved extremely despite the fact that I wasn't as motivated for going to worlds as my teammates. Obviously i wanted to win, but seeing how much they wanted it, gave me more than enough motivation to become a stronger player and give my best.   You might be thinking, why the heck wasn't he as motivated as his teammates for Worlds, as it's a dream for every professional player? Well, the answer is simple (to me atleast).   My whole dream before 2014 was becoming a professional LoL player. When I reached that dream, or goal rather, my aims for 2014 was to become solid and confident enough to compete at that level. That was all I was looking for. I never expected I would get to worlds in my introduction to professional League of Legends.   Anyhow, as we went to Taipei, the whole Svenskeren thing happened, and he got banned for the first 3 games. I want to make it clear to everyone, that no one hated or blamed him for that - also he was the one who felt the worst from all of us.   We all basically looked at it from the bright side, that it was only 3 games and not more, and that we had a sub jungler. At first i didn't think it would hit me, playing with another jungler, but it definitely did.   So lets now talk about what happened those 6 games at Worlds group stages, and what made me play as poorly as i did:   I believe confidence has A LOT to do with a players performance on a big stage. So basically lack of confidence are the keywords in my whole performance, and everyone, including myself, would say i choked. No surprise.   So there are two possible reasons to which of why, made me play as i did;     Being me, not playing with the jungler i had played with for 1 year, including almost 200 scrims in 2 weeks time in Korea.     Being me, playing on an international stage.       The answer is obvious to me, as my confidence was at 80% in the Summer Playoffs for Worlds. My confidence was exactly at the point, of where it had to be perfect, at the time in Korea also, and there is NO way that playing against the international teams, of which I had played against for 2 weeks, or me playing on a big stage had any affect on my play whatsoever.   So to sum it all up, the whole thing with Svenskeren, kind of screwed over my confidence and therefore my performance. But as I've stated, he was never blamed or hated for this, in the team. We all tried to look at the bright side of the situation and play as well as we could, with a substitute. I also wish to mention that Gilius played extremely well, taken in consideration of what he got thrown into, with barely 1-2 days of practice in the team.   I know it is big words for me to tell you all, that my performance at Worlds, was nowhere near the level that I was actually at, at that time. But this is also for the sake of my pride, and I want to prove everyone wrong.   I have never been more motivated for Worlds, as I am now.
1	Ok first off I'm not offended. I am an atheist. I don't know what your profession is but I work in a public relations office. This would be offensive for any corporation to do. Regardless of the facts of where or how something began that you have to give, it is still irrelevant. What it stands for now is a mockery of a religious figure, most commonly the God of the Bible.
1	Ashe  is  however the only one who triggers these specific issues. From what I understand all of the other champs included just allow you to use a self-cast ability on other champs. The issue with Ashe is that it forces your champion to use a specific attack index. This index is the ult for some champs, and for Nasus it prevents him from using his Q active, since he's not performing a regular AA.
0	This is a pretty good resource:   As for which language to choose first... I'd personally go with python, C/C++, or java. I recommend python because it's easier to code with.  But, if you learn C/C++ first, then your next programming language will be much easier to learn (C/C++ can be difficult). And Java because it's often the language used to teach people programming (in the schools I have gone to).
0	I've been in the workforce for 15 years through half a dozen companies. Get used to this kind of thing, it seems to be extremely common.   My understanding of it is that psychopaths interview extremely well: after all the energy that you or I pour into doing a good job has been diverted for them into presenting a completely false persona of competence; so they're really good at it!   So they get the jobs over people who know a lot and perform well, and perhaps are even socially normal, but don't talk at a mile a minute (baffling brains with bullshit) while papering over their many faults with lies and more lies. These people also tend to have a lot of misplaced confidence and so appear confident and reliable that they can get the job done; but they can't.   Also befuddling is that companies continue to keep these people on the payroll as seat warmers even after they've completely failed every reasonable metric for the 3-6 month probation period. But again... they present well and talk over it.
1	You've got an interesting problem... because you don't actually own the copyright in any of the original content in your video. Riot of course owns all the League-related content, and the sounds you added are obviously sourced from somewhere else. Normally the answer would be just put a notice with Youtube who will take down their video (almost automatically). Problem is (1) it's probably not worth it since that "copier" barely has any views or notoriety and (2) he can file counter-notice saying it's his and you would be dragged into a pretty pointless lawsuit.
1	Coast are heavy favorites in this tournament. Noone was saying LoLpro was the best or even 2nd best. They 2-0'd today not dropping 1 game. They may have looked shaky but never for a whole game. In every single week of every sport there is a team that should dominate someone but they only end up winning by a small margin.
0	Well im screwed. Im about to go deposit $4 dollars in my account so i can buy a whole $10 worth of gas with my card because i only have like $9 total in it. And i need all the gas i can get since my car estimates i only have 7miles left (keeping in mind that one gallon gets me 33.8 miles). So i really need gas to last me until Thursday. And mathematically, im fucked. $10 is going to get me about 3 gallons, which is roughly 100 miles (i drive about 40 of actual distance daily(but with LA traffic i used up about 50miles worth)) which by Thursday is going to leave me with maybe (if im lucky) 10miles worth which is less than a gallon again. It's gonna be close.
1	Cause even if someone is afk theyre still registered to the game i.e theyre still playing. When they disconnect you are getting a 2:1 vote.   So youre just dumb and dont understand how its coded. If youre afk ingame youre still ingame i.e coded as not afk. If you alt-f4 youre coded as not being in game
1	I'm a fucking mathematics grad student irl and nobody would give me shit about saying 66% for 2/3. I mean, mother of god, even in my comment I am 100% (or 99.9, repeating of course,% right) right in saying that 66% is below the minimum value as can be seen by the fact that 2/3 is not enough and 2/3 >= 0.66.....
1	All adcs have different strengths and weaknesses, as well as situations when you want to pick them. I'll list their strengths and create a mini tier list at the end.     Ashe  is an adc that has decent engage potential but has weaker damage than most.     Caitlyn  is a very safe adc with a weak midgame, but a very strong early game and an average lategame. She is great for sieging.     Corki  is a very strong adc in general, he has a good early game,great midgame, and average lategame. He also has siege potential with his rockets and Q.     Draven  is a risky pick, and takes a bit of practice. He can Snowball leads very easily and can become a monster with 2 items.     Ezreal  is a very safe champion with a very strong early game and a great midgame. His lategame is very dependent on how good you are at landing mystic shots.     Graves  is a great lane bully and is amazing for new players because of his passive. His midgame is average and his lategame suffers because of a lack of range, but other than this, he is a great champion and if you can position properly he can become a monster.     Jinx  is a very strong champion who Just needs a kill or two to snowball. She becomes stronger as the game goes on, without really having a weak point in the game.She's like kog maw with a different passive.     Kalista  is very hard to place at the moment because she hasn't been out for long enough. From my experiences, she is underwhelming if she doesn't go at least average in lanephase, and she needs a couple items to get going. Her objective control with E makes her very strong,since the stacks have no cap.     Kog'Maw  is a very strong champion who does much better in competitive play than soloque because he has no mobility and requires peel from the team. He gets stronger as the game goes on, much like Jinx. His siege is very strong and he can Shred through tanks with his w.     Lucian  is a very strong champion who has no weak point in the game. This being said, he also never has a very strong point. He is very consistent and only needs 2 items to be able to keep up with any adc in damage.     Miss fortune  lacks an escape, and has an ultimate that makes her immobile. She can be very strong with the proper setup but she feels like a weaker version of graves, who can deal more aoe damage while being more mobile. This being said, If you build trinity into shiv, you can be fairly mobile as long as you position properly.     Quinn  can be  an interesting champion, and can bring out a lot of unexpected damage. Most people will max q first, but in my opinion maxing w first into e will give you better mobility and damage. She  can be a lot stronger than people expect, but she is lacking a strong ultimate. It's better to use it after you disengage with your vault for extra distance.     Sivir  is a very strong champion who hasn't seen much popularity but is definitely one of the stronger adcs on this list. She can stay relevant all game and really only requires an IE and a stattik to get going.Excellent poke and waveclear helps her stay relevant all game and her ultimate is a great ability for teamfights.     Tristana  is a strong champion with a weak early game, but she makes up for it with a very strong lategame. She is weaker than kogmaw as far as scaling is concerned, but she is still a great pick.     Twitch  is great in all phases of the game but suffers from a strong escape, he has amazing damage potential, but requires a strong frontline to be able to utilize it.     Varus  is a decent poke champion who is strong all game but is far too immobile to take advantage of it. He can destroy teams with his poke and engage with his ultimate, but more often than not he's going to be using it to snare whoever jumps on top of him.     Vayne  Requires a lot of practice, but if you put in the time to learn her, she can become a beast. Inexperienced players will have difficulty with her early game, but players with a lot of practice on her can win most lanes with ease.       Top Tier- champions who can be picked in any situation     Corki     Ezreal     Lucian     Sivir       Tier 1- champs who Are strong but not strong enough to be picked in any situation     Cait     Jinx     Kog     Twitch     Trist     Graves       Tier 2-  champions who need a buff to be placed higher     MF     Varus     Ashe     Quinn       Skill dependant champions -champions who require a lot of time put into them to be played well. These champs have top tier potential but only if you work to put them there.     Draven     Vayne       NOT PLACING KALISTA IN ANY TIER UNTIL I GET MORE TIME TO TEST HER
1	Yeah, buff early game champions then ppl play and crush top lane with them. After that buff late game top laners, ppl crush early game too with them. Then buff late game junglers to compete with top laners. Back where we are the only difference is mid and bot is a lot weaker. So you need to buff adcs and mids. Top mains cries cuz adcs are too stronk. Final desicion. NERF EVERYTHING.
1	This is just bullshit. Yes it is bad if one company has the whole market under control for a certain product because they can lower quality and ask for more money because no one else can offer the product.   Streaming is a completely different thing. There is a ton of potential money in the market and as soon as twitch start to get shitty a bunch of new services will come out of nowhere and take over. You don't need much to start a site like twitch (compared to producing cars for example) and there's an insane amount of investors that would throw money at a new service if the community is unsatisfied with twitch.   The twitch guys know that too, the crowd that uses their service is not stupid and they know they have choices.

1	He said he got tired of the competitive scene and the pressure and whatnot.
1	It is not my first language but I fully understand what you said and I still believe it's not true but I do think that you didn't understand me.   Coin > Relic   (NEVER)   Talisman > Mountain (Only in certain match ups)   Coin is useless. Hands down it does nothing. Relic gives you faster pushing for lvl 2 and sustain to you and your carry.   Going for Relic and then selling it mid game and buying Talisman because you need it. This yes, worth.   Also it is probably not even 10% . Yesterday when I checked the last 50-60 games there were 0 talismans/coins. Doubt there'd be more than 4 in the other 40-50 games to make it even close to 10%.   Even blitz who builds Talisman more doesn't have many buys. I just checked the last 100 games in probuilds and there were 8 talismans.
1	It doesn't "proc" on ranged. You must CS normally on Thresh which makes it harder since there is no "execute"
1	Okay I'm going to ignore the fact that you just compared the combined utility of 2 spells to the utility of a single spell and the fact that you blatantly ignored the other spell hits up to the entire team and just break down thresh's kit for you and why those spells as well as other factors make him weaker for solo queue than other supports. Before I get into this I want to point out that thresh is both my 2nd most played champ in ranked and the fact that I have a winning record with him so my opinions on him are neither uninformed nor do they stem from me not being able to win games with him.   Death sentence:   For starters hitting someone with death sentence isn't nearly as impactful as hitting them as many people think, at least not when compared to other spells supports have such and Dark binding, rocket grab, or Annie stun. Another problem with this spell is that to follow it up with flay you have to recast it which will often put yourself at risk. While often putting yourself at risk like this can pay off big you always run the risk of people not following up on it as quickly as they need to or even at all due to lack of communication and/or coordination which is symptomatic of solo queue. Expounding upon that point even if you don't recast your Q it causes your ADC to have to do a lot more decision making than many other spells that have more obvious goals. Did thresh just land hook to make  _  lose cs? Does he want me to all in? Should I just use this opportunity to get free farm? Should I go for a short trade? Often the answer to these questions is far more ambiguous than with other support spells and it can definitely make a far smaller impact on the lane/game when the wrong choice is made than say Dark binding which will always do more damage and can junk the opponent even if your adc does nothing. Another spell I think draws the most obvious comparison is rocket grab, which both does more damage, puts you at less risk and the enemy at more, and is less ambiguous as to it's goal, it's a hard initiation and will pretty much always be recognized as such unlike thresh q which is more multipurposed.   Dark Passage:   This spell is the single biggest thing that makes him amazing competitively but somewhat lack luster for solo queue. Apart from it's small shield which now can only be given to a single ally it's entire utility is based on the decision making of your ally which is never going to be consistent and when discussing a champs strength in solo queue, consistency is key. When used properly by your allies dark passage is IMO the single most OP thing in thresh's kit, far more than his Q dark passage is what makes thresh an amazing champ. It's a free long range gap closer and escape on a fairly low cool down that any of your allies can use and it's what makes him god tier in competitive play. However often your allies will take lanterns meant for someone else or just ignore them entirely or simply take them too early if you're planning on using it in conjunction with death sentence.   Flay:  Honestly this spell actually doesn't have much down side for solo queue it's decent cc and adds damage to your autos which is never a bad thing. It works best for disengage so pretty much the only small con I can say about it is that for purely disengage purposes it's mild compared to something like nami bubble, black shield, or even blitz knock up. That being said this is thresh's least ally reliant spell.   The Box:  Really good for peeling or engaging only problem with this one is you generally have to put yourself in danger to get a really good one on the enemy team and you run the risk of your team mates not seizing that opportunity.   On top of this thresh's base stats are pretty low, he's not naturally tanky and does very minimal damage even by support standards so unless you're collecting an absolutely insane amount of souls he's really item dependent to become tanky.   If you're wondering why the only champs I compared him to are blitz nami and morg it's both for brevity purposes as this is already fairly lengthy and because those are the other 3 supports I have the most experience with.
1	Riot does fine for the most part- it's when they introduce elements with no real basis to what they have done before that they really fall short. A good example of this would be Azir, who added a lot of things the game had never seen before or implemented to the extent previously.   League's code base has almost certainly grown substantially since it's infancy, and what they have done with their engine that is now five+ years old is pretty remarkable.   Coding is not as simple as you make it out to be, testing is NOT plug and play,and Riot- contrary to popular belief- is quite human.   Is Kalista passive/Relic Shield a bug? It's not up to you or I to determine that- because the implementation of Kalista's W passive makes sense logically. However, just because something makes logical sense doesn't mean that it feels good to the player.   If Riot feels that the current behavior sucks (I, for what it's worth as an ADC main, feel that it does), then they will change it- and if the changes to how her W damage functions that are on the PBE are to be believed, they are.
0	My parents had just retired when I went in to college (and separated). My mom made some money, but my dad had no income (retired) and he paid for my medical insurance. This made him the "most contributory parent". I worked full time which paid for housing, and all other living expenses. I didnt get aid from dad (beyond the medical ins), but because his annual income was nothing fafsa gave me tuition and a little scratch for books. Got through college with zero debt. I did also go to a inexpensive state school.   Best friends family: he was one of three and they made just enough to be lower middle/upper lower for the area. He got no aid from parents either (and his parents definitely would not be able to help at all). Because his parents worked, he got no aid from fafsa. He certainly would've been more deserving IMO from a assistance programs perspective.
0	We picked up a drunk guy once and gave him a ride home. It was cold out (December I think) and it was a slow night. The guy was friendly as hell and said he was too drunk to drive. So we dropped him off at his house and went on our way. About an hour later we get a call from dispatch to respond to a domestic dispute in progress, and sure as shit, the same guy we gave a ride home was beating his wife. So, needless to say, new department policy prohibited us from giving any more vehicle escorts.

A guy I hung out withs wife poeted on Facebook  that she took extra time loading her trunk,  then walking around her car,  then dicking around on the phone in her turned off car. She got a slew of You Go Girls from her equally awful friends amd I merely stated "You know that YOU are the villain of this story he was trying to park you were bullying" and I guess it sent a cascade of negative remarks towards her and that night I got a call saying I couldn't  hang out with Joe.
0	I went to school with a girl who refuses to vaccinate her children now because she lost her baby brother at a very young age. The full story behind just proves that this girl is an asshat though. Her baby brother died in a car accident on the way home from the pediatrician the day he got his second round of shots (4 months). She claims that him getting his vaccines was the ultimate cause of death instead of, you know, being hit by a fucking car and not being properly strapped into his car seat.
1	DON't PLAY RANKED YET. I am speaking as someone that went 3-10 and was placed bronze three. Yes, I was the kid that was actually better than what he placed. I wasted three months of climbing to gold because I didnt wait to really hone some of my skills and learn all positions before I rushed my 10 placements.
0	It doesn't help that all my go-to forms of entertainment require Internet. "Internet's not working, better check Reddit just in case. Nope, okay, PC games it is. I wonder if Steam has any good sale- dammit. Urgh, Xbox One? Nope, all the best stuff is online. Can't even rely on my phone, data usage is close to the limit for this month. Crap.".   Eventually I end up using an intricate system of mini-usb cables, multi-USB cables, USB speakers and back up phone batteries to play emulated N64 (sticking true to the nerd I am I also have USB N64 controllers I can plug in) or watch movies on my phone.
0	Edit: This was referring to /u/keystothemoon 's comment, which I mistook for OP's post for no reason other than /u/keystothemoon 's comment was near the top of the page... Feelin'  super  sharp today.   I'm sorry this happened to you, it's an incredible violation for you. I find it fucking appalling.   Perhaps she really wanted to hurt you w/ this vile weapon (false accusations, her friends' trust) she found herself in possession of, perhaps she was a gross, hateful person & did it on purpose. Perhaps she was an entitled, immature person & couldn't at all appreciate what this would do to you. Perhaps she didn't even care what it would do to you b/c all she cared about was relieving her shame/negative emotions, so she relieved herself of any agency in an act that made her feel bad by fabricating your guilt & her innocence.   My take is that feminism is a total red herring here. More culpable in driving her actions is internalized sex-negative bullshit: the delusion that casual sex is dirty, bad, or diminishes your value.   Should /u/keystothemoon read this, I'm sorry if this rubs you the wrong way. As w/ any stranger's unsolicited opinion, I trust you'll disregard it if it's bothersome to you. I apologize if it annoys you, you've already had enough grief from this.
0	If I were a feminist.   I would campaign against female only gyms and female only sections in gyms. If I wasn't seen to be promoting equality even when it didn't benefit me then I wouldn't have any credibility.   I would confront my employer about their female mentor ship program and goal to have a certain percentage of women on the board in 5 years as it's discriminatory and will result in the best candidate not being given the job. Something that I'm strongly opposed to.   I would accept that young people are quite often stupid and do stupid things like get drunk and have sex that they regret later. That's not rape it's called growing up.   I think if I did all this then when I say things like 'Hey why do women get paid less for doing the same job?' then I might get listened to.
1	Heimerdinger is not a garbage champ at all. (I may be have some bias: own 3 skins, played him quite a bit). He can honestly win any matchup.   Laning phase is pretty easy, consists of zoning and farming with your turrets, stunning enemies that come in your turrets' range, and poking with your rockets.   Heim's ultimate is just amazing. There's something for almost any situation. Two or three enemies diving you? Ult+q+zhonyas (while in the range of your other turret's as well) and pick up a double or triple. Need to burst an enemy down from long range (stun) ult+w. Need to initiate a teamfight (or back off from a losing one)? Ult+e.   Peoples hate for heimerdinger probably come from playing against him. It's just really hard to go all in or gank a heim. There just not much you can do against him. If you play heimerdinger, just be prepared for being flamed by the enemy for just sitting back and letting your turret's do all the work for you.
0	I will agree with some of your points, however, if someone has sex with another person, knowing they are in a relationship, I still feel this makes them a bad person.   I've had the "don't you trust me?" argument thrown at me a few times when I was warned by people that she was a cheater. And I let my ego get in the way until I caught her. But I still feel like the person she slept with has no argument. They slept with my girlfriend, knowing that she was supposed to be committed to me. That is not a good person and while in a way, they did me a favor, they're still just as much of a piece of shit as my cheating ex.
0	Pharmacy tech here, this happens a lot, actually... Most people understand; you apologise, they thank you for it, and you tell them you will make a note of it so this doesn't happen again. I've never had anyone get upset at me for this, and I've had it happen at least 6 or 7 times in the last three years....   Like I said it's not really uncommon, considering that people on medications usually have something wrong with them, and the older folks are typically on more and more medications the older they get.
0	Ok so i might have exaggerated the 60kg lifts. Theyre all machine lifts on their own but we have product like gun safes that need two or more ppl to lift. We have a system that gives you a specific time for weights, distance, shift length etc. All based on safe weight limits and working procedures. If they cant hit 100% theyre an obese mess or lazy as fuck.
1	Just wanted to jump on your point here, « personal » AP items mean little since Riot can tweak that Champion's ratios just to adapt to their taste (see Cassiopeia : she may have >9000 AP lategame but Riot specifically tweaked her ratios). It, however, is a question of whether they want that champion to synergize well or not with  Rabaddon's Deathcap .   Edit :  By that I mean... Let's say the Hextech Core gives 200 AP (it's 155 but I want easier numbers to compute). Riot wants Viktor's  Death Ray  to gain a ~150 damage powerspike (for whatever reason) when Viktor finishes his  Hextech Core . Therefore, they will give it a 0.75 AP ratio (it's 0.7 currently).  However !  They also want to reward Viktor for going glass canon (i.e.  Rabaddon's Deathcap ), so they keep the +200 AP item but will probably decrease  Death Ray  ratio if the need arise.   Saying that « he's the only guy who can build more than 2 +120 AP items » would work only if every champion in the game was identical. If that argument was solid, it would indeed be a « Viktor is plain better » argument, which Riot seems pretty wanton to avoid (see Toplane Disaster and current Jungle issues), preferring « Viktor is better  in that situation, filling that role  » - for good reasons.
1	How I got over my toxicity:   A while ago, I was your average silver ADC Main, and I got pissed off A LOT. Eventually, I got so mad at the game, I gave up. I said "Instalocking Nidalee, every game, every lane" I stopped talking in chat and communicated only through pings. When I did talk, i would only say things like Nids quote's, or just put <3's when deserved. I generally never get mad at the game anymore and tend to play for fun alone. From Silver 1 to Plat 4, the climb has begun.   This obviously will not work for some people (or most people), but just what i did to get out of my toxicity.
1	TF W+ TF E+ Lich Bane.   His items were Rabadons Deathcap, Zhonyas Hourglass, Morellonomicon, Lich Bane, and Mejais (Likely 20 Stacks).   This means the gold card had a base damage of 175%xTF's base AD, with 175 Base Damage (He's level 17, assuming E max 3rd), and a 155% AP scaling.   Twisted Fate's base AD will be 102, giving him 102 Physical Damage, and 76 Magic Damage (Due to Lich Bane). TF's AP will be (assuming 21/X/X with all AP damage dealing masteries maxed out) 120+120+80+80+180+15+15+6 or 616, which multiplied by 1.43 is 880 AP. With a 155% AP Scaling, this equates to 1364 Damage.   Twisted Fates Total Damage right now is 1440 Magic Damage and 102 Physical Damage. With Havoc, its is now 1483.2 Magic Damage and 102 Physical Damage.   Yasuo has no MR (assuming he is not running MR runes), leading to him only having his 30 base MR. TF gets 28 effective MR on Yasuo after factoring masteries, and only 5 effective MR on Yasuo after factoring runes. That is basically 5% effective HP against TF's magic damage burst. Yasuo has 1416 HP (keep in mind Yasuo has taken some damage), with a 215 shield on passive.
0	I hate that this myth is so pervasive and persistent in our culture. Exercise doesn't magically negate the effects of poisoning your body. You might look healthy on the outside, but you are still killing yourself. Most people understand that you can't just exercise to counteract the effects of smoking. No one would say, "You just consumed arsenic? You better go for a run!" Why do people, then, think it is different when it comes to alcohol and crappy food?

1	Look into Soraka if you want a true healer. As someone who mains Sona, I can honestly say her heal is somewhat close to a joke. It costs a large amount of mana early, and doesn't heal that well. Sona is VERY strong at long, sustained trades however. If your adc and you keep having skirmishes with the enemy, you'll outlast them no problem. Sona is VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY weak to being engaged on, as her only CC is her E powerchord (Which you typically don't get a point in E until level 4 or 8), or her ultimate. You're either gambling your life with a powerchord, or burning your ultimate just to save your life. Soraka has an AoE silence, which turns into a root if they stay in it at the end. You throw that puddle down and walk away like nothing happened. Nami's E is basically 3 Sona's E powerchords, except applicable on ANY ally, and Nami has her bubbles as well for disengage, counter-engage, or just straight engage if you're good enough. The other main difference is that Sona's heal is not targetted, and I've had cases where it would top of my 90% hp ally instead of healing the 20% one, whereas Nami and Soraka are able to target their heals.
0	I put my resume damn near everywhere I could. Monster, career builder, my state's department of labor website, etc... and applied to everything I could find.   My first semi-real job I got out of college was as a test technician for military hardware. I got that job because they were looking for about two dozen of us and could afford to have a few washouts during training. It was a two months full time, four months off deal.   The next job (my current one) is full time. Remember how I said to post your resume everywhere? There are a billion temp-to-hire recruiters out there browsing job sites. When they spot your resume they'll email you about a position they've been contracted to fill and, if you're interested, they'll contact the company for you to arrange the interview. If you're hired, you technically work for the headhunter for 6-12 months and at the end of your contract, the host company has the option to hire you themselves if they're happy with you. This is what happened for me. I was brought in to interview as a test technician, clicked really well with the interviewers and was hired on as a temp. I used those six months to work my ass off and make a name for myself. At the end of my contract, there was a position open as a test engineer so I applied on a whim. They knew what I could do, so they hired me as one of their own and promoted me right out of the gate.
0	i played d1 sports in college and played semi-pro in the summers so I couldn't work a job. i have to be honest, as much as people think you get the benefit of the doubt as an athlete, often you're left with interesting experiences and few upsides. the sports/coaching industry is incredibly bureaucratic (imagine that!), businesses want you purely for sales/commission based work, and all of your free time was spent working out, working out to workout, or working on your workout.
0	So here's the story:   I was with this one girl (Rachel) for a little while and we broke up because we never got to see each other. I started liking this other girl (Pam), but never got very far with it. Rachel started flirting with me (or at least I thought so) and I still had feelings for her so I was going to ask her if she wanted to get back together with me. Then yesterday (when I was going to ask Rachel if she wanted to get back together) I saw Rachel and Pam kiss. I knew Rachel was bi and I thought Pam was bi, but out of all the people they had to date each other.
1	Overall, I think you have a good idea. But in practical terms, it is unreasonable and difficult to administer. What happens when your entire team votekicks the first pick because he locked a jungler, where there was someone else who wanted to jungle? Problematic to say the least.   And another issue I've noticed: a ton of people do off-meta related things. playing such things as [NAMI JUNGLE]( could be considered trolling, but they could main said thing. sure Nocturne with Clairvoyance and Ghost is pretty troll, but ynow... use clairvoyance to spot enemies to ult from a distance, ghost to keep your fear tether easier...  secret op strats m8
0	I was waiting tables on an April 1st. Had a group come in to celebrate a pregnancy. They brought a cake that would tell the baby's gender by the color of the cake, revealed when cutting it. The expectant mom was not yet aware of the impending child's sex. She cuts the cake to reveal pink, joyously exclaiming, "I was really really hoping for a baby girl!" That was quickly followed by hubby and  family yelling, "April Fool's!" The hormonal pregnant lady did not find the humor in this. That was an awkward check to drop.
1	Top - usually tanks (Gnar, Maokai) or AP mage (Lissandra, Rumble)   Jungle - either earlygame based jungler, that snowballs other lanes with his huge damage earlygame (Lee Sin, Rek Sai) or utility tank (Sejuani, Zac) that shines in lategame.   Mid - mostly AP sustain damage (Orianna, Ziggs) or AP burst mages (Annie, Viktor etc.) or assassins (Zed, Katarina, LeBlanc). Most of mids stay by their supports and marksmans to peel each other, but assassins need to damage enemy backline.   ADC - physical damage carries, super squishy but he's main source of damage (Lucian, Graves, Caitlyn)   Support - adc's support (Thresh, Janna, Nami). He controls vision and makes plays by catching enemies, by engaging teamfights etc.   I'm mid main so I can tell you that mid is mostly about outfarming, outplaying (killing) and outroaming your opponent. The best champions right now are: Zed, Xerath, Ahri, LeBlanc, Viktor, Katarina, Annie (random order)   Laning phase takes place from start to about 10 or 20 minutes (really depends on how lanes are going and roaming). After that teams should be focused on taking objectives (Towers, Dragons, Baron;   Towers give map control and global gold,   Dragons give permament stacks, that gives you combat/movement/pushing stats (taking dragons is really good, because it pays off in lategame), but give no gold.   Baron gives same gold as 2 towers to everyone on team and gives a buff to everyone on team that gives you 40ap/40ad and faster recalling (4sec instead of 8sec) AND aura that makes your minions faster and stronger, but only when someone with baron buff is in range.
1	to keep it simple: If the passive has a name, it will not stack. if it just says Unique passive, it will stack. :)  So I Lichbane and a triforce, wont stack. A ghost blade and a Black cleaver armor pen, will stack! :D So rememeber

1	They've already explained why this wouldn't work. They have to be able to penalize people with -lp without taking away their mmr. If Riot takes away 3 lp for a dodge or even 10 or more for repeated offenses, they can't take away mmr or a good player will play with bad players simply because he skipped. If you use an artificial lp system you can take away the merit without taking away mmr. If people can just check their mmr after a punishment and see it hasn't changed then they won't care about dodging or decay or anything  else.   The lp system is necessary, just poorly implemented. Promotion series are largely arbitrary and completely contradictory to the idea of lp in the first place. Afks in a game could easily subtract from lp but not mmr (I'm not a worse player for losing the game because someone didn't connect than I would be if I won if he had). In other words the benefits that could have come from an lp system were largely ignored while drawbacks like lp cliffs (try dia 5) or promotion series are there for seemingly no reason.   The elo system as a whole breaks down after around the 2.5k elo mark anyway, so it's not really Riot's fault. Challenger and Master are huge and largely inneffective bandaids placed to keep it in check. Chess masters also use the elo system and the gripes are numerous. At a high enough elo it's impossible to seperate people consistantly and fairly. To get to 2.5 or even 2.9ish like some have done you need to beat worse players, but if a 2.9 elo shits on 2.3 elo kids all day every day, is he 3.0? How can he be if no one else is there? Who is to say how much better someone like Faker, Apdo, or Marin are than their counterparts? Are they winning because they're gods and could easily demolish people, or are they winning because their skill cap is just a liiiiiiitle bit higher than everyone else's? They'd win either way, but their skill is largely unknown.
0	My mother moved to Baltimore when I was 14, when I was 16 I finally got the chance to visit her. She didn't have much money and stayed about 20 mins out of the centre of town (I forget the area), anyway one of the first days she was working and I was left on my own I got bored and went for a walk. Ended up in what I found out after was a rather sketchy area. Now, a few people did approach me looking rather menacing, asking for money etc. And I did shit myself a fair bit, but as soon as I spoke to them were super nice to me and went on there way wishing me well and goodbye.   Now to let you know I am Scottish, and when they thought I was just some random white American kid they were totally gonna kick my ass and take my money. But, for some reason, as soon as they heard my Scottish accent.... nah not gonna bother him, just gonna ask loads of dumb ass questions about kilts and Nessie. This is when I learned Americans really do love Scots, fuck knows why, I was no different to any other white kid there. And for the rest of my time in Baltimore, no matter who approached me giving me shit (yeah pretty much always angry looking black guys asking me if I had any spare change, or strange looking sexual deviants trying to pick up a young white boy) I'd just hit out with my Scottish accent and boom, every one was my best mate, no hassles.   Take what you want from this story, but in my experience a 16 year old Scottish kid is effectively untouchable in one of the most dangerous cities in America.
1	I didnt watch the replay completely, i was skipping for 30 secs or so till the end to see how the game progressed so  I might be wrong but:     You should give kills to your teammates more. Now, i know it might sound crazy, but youre not going to carry 1v5. You just arent. Giving kills to your teammates will make the stronger and you will win as a team.     Dont build full tank eve when youre going fucking legendary. Get some damage and then you might see improvement. When you get 13 kills in a game you shouldnt really be going full tank, on 90% of the champions. The few exceptions are maybe Nunu, Nautilus, Sion and maybe top lane smite Shyvana. Other than that you should always get at least 1 or 2 damage items if youre this much up in gold. Those dont have to be Infinity Edges, you can buy Abyssal, Ryalis, Black Cleaver, etc.     Last one, the most important one. Try not to focus too much on others mistakes and try to play the game more calm. You werent even playing and I saw you were pretty salty. I can only imagine how it is when you play. Just try to relax a bit, if things dont work out for 2 or 3 games its alright, just go outside a bit, play some other game, do whatever. Pretty much
1	Not the viewers just you. it sounds like you're hearing what you want to hear. because riot knowing that NA LOVES SKT almost as much as tsm you should be experiencing the same for amount of noise from them according to your conspiracy theory. you should also hear sounds for FNC since a lot of na viewers favor them as well. I don't believe you know what your talking about for a lot of areas. Such as you believe that ONLY TSM fans came to this event, or the fact that you think just because their tsm fans means they don't have other teams they're fans of.
1	very much has changed, new champs, new map, new items.  overall its to much to write all down, watch some patchnotes
1	What good comes out of them giving you an update? If it gets delayed all you are going to do is bitch at them. If they hype it up you're going to bitch at them for not doing this or doing that. And if you don't bitch at them somebody else will. I'm pretty sure you noticed lately riot doesn't give any heads up to anything until it is almost done, aka at most several weeks in advanced. Riot has slowly learned from the past that telling people way too early do nothing but create disappointment and backlash (remember magma chamber?). So I don't blame them for not saying anything.   With that being said, I personally think it will be a feature that riot has dropped or maybe put on hiatus indefinitely. I say that cuz it's not that important of a feature. Sure you see it being brought up on reddit but the reddit player base is pretty much tiny compared to the entire league player base and I'm pretty sure they did polls and found that not enough people cared enough for it. Most of us just wants to play the damn game and they're probably working on other things to improve the player experience (I actually visited their hq and saw some pretty cool projects that go towards this goal that isn't just skins or champions). Plus there are 3rd party tools to let you do replays already.
1	As I've sad elsewhere, bandwidth is almost never an issue for datacentres. Unlike storage, which expands with time, bandwidth remains constant. Sending data through a cable doesn't cost money, but the cable does. In comparison to storage, bandwidth is incredibly cheap and only needs to be paid for once, with some small maintenance costs.
1	You're the stupid one if you can't even understand what he said. His friend is playing bad (aka toxic play) so that in the end everyone reports his teammates because they flamed through chat while he said nothing but enraged others with his lack of team play and unwillingness to win.
1	in an ARAM yesterday. Other than that, about a week ago a guy called jungle, picked elise, then somebody else instalocked jungle yi shortly after. So elise played support
1	Well, leaverbuster does its work and bans people who leaves a lot in games so after all you don't need to report anyone for afk. Leaverbuster detects it.   &nbsp;   Now, from my point of view, I have always said that if your pc can't handle the game you shouldn't be playing. You're being selfish if you do so, only caring about your fun even knowing that you could end crashing or dcing and therefore making your team lose.   &nbsp;   My philosophy is that if someone disconnects, I report him. If it only happened for a game then he won't be banned anyways. And if he really has a shitty computer that can't play the game then you are helping the system to make him stop ruining anyone else game.   &nbsp;
1	My favourite part is when loading screen freezes when everyone's at 100% and you're like "dafuq this is taking a while" and then you realise Riot are retarded and have put no way of detecting if you've crashed or not whilst in loading screen, so you reload and the enemy laner is five levels ahead AND WOW I'VE GOT SUCH A GREAT GAME AHEAD OF ME.
1	Don't worry i am too. I played a game as AP teemo (recently bought and loving him) and right from the beginning i knew my teammates would be assholes. I clicked teemo and didn't lock in as usual and my team instantly started saying "OMG PLS NO TEEEMO HE IS SO BAD" and stuff like "OMG FUCKING NOOB PLS DONT PICK TEEMO" so right there i locked in. They don't know me, or my play style. Once i locked in they were saying "pls atleast go ad teemo" so i told em i'd play how i wanted to.   around 2 minutes i was 5-2-10 because the xin zhao that told me i stucked was audacious charging all my kills and ksing like crazy. I'd ignite someone and hit em with my poison and as they would run away xin would charge them and ks them. Game ended and i was like 7-3-15 (surrendered) and we won. I said "I guess i'm not so bad as teemo since i'm the only one with greater than 2:1 kd." they said "no you still suck we carry"
1	So, I just played my first 5 games of Ranked (with almost the same stats as you, 340 wins, ~ that in losses), and surprisingly, went 4-1. Surprisingly(you've no clue how hard it is to spell that after taking a bong hit. unless you do.), because although I consider myself above average, i expected 3-2 tops.   As I did expect, I "cost" my team 1 game, being so under-fed with Garen I'd just stumble into the middle of a fight and bleed. Long story, but I wasn't the only cause, our Udyr was also about as worthless as a Ken doll.   With that said, if you read up on strategy and follow most of it, you won't be a detriment to your team. WARNING: My first game, I was highest elo/banmaster. I froze, and missed a ban. Couldn't find Shen. Only get half the champs to choose from? Maybe.   Other than that, I picked a champ I was comfortable with when I was first(once a tank, we Rocked Solid), played Soraka 'cause I figured no one else would(didn't see a single other the other 4 games, other than Nidalee. Others!) and again won. Complete the team is a good way to go, unless you have a Main.   Hm... last hitting is... harder. I didn't break 100 in any of the games, which lasted about the same amount of time. I truly sucked with Garen/Trynd vs. Nidalee/Teemo. We chased them to their tower, they chased us back to ours. I did my regen thing, he did his, we charged back into the fray. Epic, we came out on top, 7/5/8 with 41 CS in 34 minutes.   Not much warding outside 1 game, and myself a spot here and there. It really just felt tighter, ya know? You step into someone's radius, they're in your grill, better able to get the free shots.   Had one rager when I had the bad game, 1/5/1 or shit. He flipped it around death 3-4. But Zilean was behind me the whole time, only used his ult once. Another small bean on the Teammate side of things.   I can picture already counter-picking become a fun part of the game.   Hm. With all that said...
0	While similar, these are two different types of douchebags. The comic you linked is about a breed of douchebag that doesn't expect downvotes and bitches when he inevitably receives them. This comic is about douchebags trying to whore for karma by tricking the hivemind into believing they are independent thinkers.
1	So um, that sounds great, but speaking as a software engineer, that's not actually how bugs (or in particular fixing bugs) works.  If they found a bug, particularly a critical bug, then it's not like they can just "release everything else while they fix it."  Assuming that they even know where the bug is, making the code-change to "leave that part out" could easily introduce even more bugs.
1	Karma is fun and very effective, no matter what some people say. You have to be very good with her and good at last-hitting in general. If you can do that, she's insane and pumps out a lot of AOE damage as well as being fairly supporty. Just don't play her as a full-on support; her heal is pretty crappy on everyone except tanks so you should build more like a tanky AP carry.   I max the shield first. It makes it impossible for the opponents to do any damage at all if you use it right and it hurts pretty bad at the same time when mantra'd. I max the Q second and take one rank in bond at level four for those pinch slowdown opportunities and also for farming (it does a surprising amount of damage when you drag it through minions).   As far as items go, Rod of Ages is probably the best to rush and the best item overall for Karma. Otherwise, Kage's Lucky Pick or a Philo Stone are good to grab quick. Your main source of income is farming/assisting so the extra gold can help a lot. Depending on the situation, I either go Ionian Boots or Sorceror's Shoes. If I don't get Ionian Boots, I try to grab a Fiendish Codex later and build it into Deathfire Grasp. It's a fun late-game item for Karma as well. And of course, Rabadabadabadabadabadon's. Things like Frozen Heart or Aegis are fantastic after you've got decent AP. It makes you even harder to kill than you already are.   Runes: magic pen. marks, mana regen per level seals, AP/level glyphs, and flat AP quints.
1	I don't like to build AP on Karma. I start with a double faerie charm + pots build or one faerie charm with an enemt jungle, and rush Philo. The reason is, I don't like to take farm from my lane partner, and a philo, occasional creep, and assist gold is plenty for me. Afterwards, I gauge how well we're doing. If my lane has scored a few early kills, I'll pick up my ionian boots of lucidity. If it's passive or we're losing, I get a HoG and tier 1 boots. Again, evaluate the gameplay as you b to buy items. Fed AD carries destroying you? Rush Thornmail or Frozen Heart. And FoN or BV for AP. I love tanky Karma because my shields are plenty strong without AP, and it allows for me to easily heal and disrupt fights by standing in the center. I also can meatshield much much better and let my dps run away if need be. By being in the center, I can help dps with my Q if we're winning, W an escaping enemy or a chasing teammate, etc. Late game, I like to upgrade my philo to either a eleisa's miracle if they're cc heavy or a shurelya's if not. Another item I love is QSS, as Karma has difficulties escaping with CC on her. Don't forget wards are your friends!
1	Zilean was on skype with me and doing exactly what he should have been doing, though he was doing it a bit early.  When I asked him why he did it so early it was because of my dash; he had no idea if I'd be in range when I needed it.   Intelligent players will see a Zilean ult know they have to make a decision: Focus this target down and have them come back with more health than they had, or let them pound on you for 7 seconds.  Either way, a Zilean ult on a character that gets focused (like Akali) gives them a lot more freedom to deal damage in situations where they normally wouldn't.  Akali's role in a team fight is to assassinate the carry and low HP targets.  In order to fufill that role she does massive burst damage, but to counter that she's squishy as all fuck.  A Zilean ult means she has 7 seconds to burst down ANYONE, which is long enough to turn any team fight in her favor.
1	Free to play, try it out sometime. It's a game style that spawned off DoTA, a custom game from Warcraft III, basically you have your hero (5v5 or 3v3) and you're trying to kill the enemy's nexus/base before they kill yours. Add in lots of PvP, neutral monsters that give buffs, small creeps in lanes on each sides, and towers that defend the lanes and that's the game.
1	There are two modes: 5v5 and 3v3; 5v5 being the dominant one (3v3 wasn't there originally and 5v5 is, in general favored).   There are three lanes that spawn minions and a jungle in between with neutral monsters.   You control a champion that has 4 spells, one of which is an ultimate that cannot be used until level 6, and a passive. Each champion (there are 81) has 4 unique spells and passives; however, despite which champion you are playing, you get 2 spells that you choose before and you can pick despite which champion you play. Ghost allows you to run fast for an amount of time, Ignite deals true damage based on your level and cuts down healing effects by 50%, Exhaust makes the target move slower and do significantly less damage, etc.   The goal of the game, ultimately, is to destroy the enemy nexus. How this is achieved is killing 1 or more inhibitors in each lane (one per lane guarded by 3 turrets, only one required to win), which allows for the turrets guarding the Nexus to be attacked and then allows for the Nexus to be destroyed.   There are a lot of other elements to the game. There are buffs (red buff  makes your auto attack deal "true damage" (ignores armor and MR, does the damage that it says), more damage per your level, and slows, blue buff gives you mana and energy regeneration and cool down reduction) that are obtained from killing the neutral monster that holds it, global objectives (killing Dragon gives each person on your team Gold,  killing Baron gives each person on your team more Gold, experience, and a buff), and more.   Each champion also has it's own unique play style and role. For example,  Annie is a burst caster meaning that she can do a lot of damage in a short amount of time but has to wait for cool downs before doing any more damage. And, since her damage is mostly from spells, she itemizes Ability Power to hit higher. Amumu is a tank who has great initiation. Ashe is an AD (attack damage) carry whose damage comes mostly from her auto attack, therefore buying AD makes her hit higher, but also benefits from crit chance, life steal, and attack speed.   In general, the game has many elements and in order to be good at the game you have to understand these elements and use the knowledge to your advantage. It's also tons of fun to play and I would definitely recommend it to anybody and everybody. It's kind of like Nexus Wars, in a way.
1	Another thing to note blueboybob, is that League of Legends is going to be coming out with one of their biggest updates since the game was released as a closed beta, its a whole new game mode with a whole different type of strategy involved.   I had seen previously you asked about the length of games, and even though the traditional map Summoner's Rift (5v5) can take anywhere from 20 minutes (surrender) to 80 minutes (the longest I've ever played) this new game mode averages around 20 minutes of explosively action packed gameplay. This new mode is called Dominion, and I'll post some helpful links in a second. Basically, if you are familiar with Call of Duty games where you play Domination, you capture 5 point on the map with your champion, and the longer you hold these points for, and the more you control, the faster your enemy teams points fall. When your enemy team's points hit 0, you win. This game mode is something revolutionary to the MOBA genre, and you'll basically be around as it sprouts.   Things to note about Dominion:     Brand New Map   Brand New Game Mode   New Items   Instead of starting at level 1 in game, you start at level 3 (max level is 18)   New buffs (special  upgrades  in game such as speed boost or more damage)
1	You know what sucks is that the majority of times I play with redditors I feel so pressured to play perfectly. I know that's my own problem, but I remember 2 particular games where in the first game, one of the redditors said in mumble "Guys, how does it feel to have a girl have a better k/d ratio than us" (I'm a girl) and at first I thought it was just a joke but he said something similar later on and I think he really meant it.   I'm usually not sensitive about the whole "haha gamer girls lololol" but I don't want to have to worry about that when I'm just trying to play with fellow redditors.   In the 2nd game, I was having a lot of trouble getting turretdove like crazy up top and although I kept asking if I could get some help, they just said "you better step your game up", or "I blame this loss on you".   Sorry, had to let that out.   Feels bad man.

1	I play mostly solo top offtank and the occasional jungle udyr, so can anyone enlighten me a bit on what the required runes are for this build? I know I can jungle with udyr and WW without very many runes, but ive tried jungling with noc and I just kinda die..... and I DO know how to position his Q to land all the creeps. And what about in lane?
1	When I first saw Talon's Crimson Elite skin, I was like : "What the fuck is this space opera power ranger shit?!", and I also had that sort of reaction at Riven's version. But then I thought about it a little, and if they can keep the concept going for the other characters who are no doubt going to have this type of skin, it is going to be quite hilarious to have that sort of uniformed power ranger team. It is sort of a unique 90'ish style.   They should just be careful to not drop the ball on the aesthetic like they did with Commando Lux, who doesn't really seem to fit in with the other Commandos. Maybe she is like special forces or some shit or some special type of officer or whatever, but I think I would have preferred a look that was more unified with the other commandos like this one made by ChiZ:
1	This right here is why i stopped jungling. almost without fail, I will have a lane who bitches that they never get ganks even though they have the enemy hugging their own tower because they pushed it so hard. Then they get ganked because they dont have a river ward. So i put my wriggles ward down there for them instead of warding objectives or jungle. Or the best is when im getting blue or red and gank the lane closest to the buff and the lane furthest away is like wtf man why you gank lane closest to you?
1	What I want to make clear is that HALF the people you play with are better than you are and HALF the people you play with are worse. You could be gaining rank quickly and then it's slightly less than half to slightly more than half.   The problem with this theory is that it supposes nobody "belongs" at any elo other than what they're at.   For instance, someone who "belongs" at 900 Elo, will (probably) be the worst player in every single game they play until they hit that Elo.  Since it only takes minor amounts of luck to win half their games in the first 10 ranked games, it will take around 30 straight losses to put them at their rightful Elo.  That entire time, they'll be the worst player on the team.   Likewise, someone who belongs at 1900 Elo will be the best player on their team for many games.
1	ding ding ding. and the most important takeaway from all of that,
1	Why would you want to promote this kind of lazy attitude?  Even as a joke?  I would prefer for the community to actually think and read over
1	Here's a good guide by Westrice at Solomid. It will give you a good idea for masteries and runes. As for playstyle, be very passive before you get your ultimate and focus on getting as many CS as you possibly can get. Once you hit level 6, poking becomes much easier, as you deal tons of damage with Q. Speaking of, my preferred skill order is Q-E-W, maxing R at 6-11-16. Now, one thing you must know about akali in order to deal as much damage as you can : Casting Q then R immediately afterwards causes you to get to your target before your Q, wasting an auto-attack, therefore wasting your Q. The trick is to cast your Q and wait half a second to a second. Then jump at your target with R and enjoy seeing a good chunk of your enemies HP drop.
1	There is a simple solution for this, TwitchTV is the gaming redirect for JustinTV, go to  and sign up there, then go to their games section at  , find what you are looking for there, and it will redirect to TwitchTV without you having to deal with their shit website.

1	For me, MF feels like a champ with so much potential, but falls flat in almost every way.   Starting with her passive, it's nice, but it tends not to provide much benefit for when you actually NEED movespeed, i.e. in chasing and running from ganks. It's handy to have for when you're running from fountain and between lanes, but it doesn't bring much to the game beyond that.   Her Q is probably her strongest skill, which is a bummer because it feels entirely gimmicky and pretty tricky to land reliably. A tiny change like making it seek out Champions (similar to Sona's Q) if at all possible would make this a much stronger skill and take away some of the finicky nature. The mana cost is pretty high for early spamming, which is when it's most effective. Aside from the double-bounce, it's a really inferior single-shot nuke compared to stuff like gangplank's parrrley.   Her W is really situational. The extra AS is always nice, but AS is pretty cheap to itemize for so it's not really that critical. The skill's real meat is in the stacking damage, and healing reduction. The extra damage is great to have if you're focus-firing someone, and will add up with enough items. That's what saves this skill from being totally useless. The reason why it's situational is that its effectiveness depends a lot on the enemy teamcomp. If you're going against, say...Warwick, Vlad, Sion, Akali, and Soraka, your W is going to be putting in some fucking work and making them bitches cry. But if you're against a team like Jarvan, Ezreal, Karthus, Janna, and Amumu, they're not too likely to notice the reduction in heals. I feel like this skill could be really improved if it added a DoT like Tristana's explosive shot.   Her E is by far her weakest skill. Huge mana cost, short duration, so-so range, and totally pathetic damage. It's only useful for the slow, which isn't really that impressive compared against other AOE slow skills like Singed's super adhesive. Long casting time that sort of makes it tricky to use it as an escape. At least it gives vision.   The ulti is probably the most underwhelming skill in the game in terms of visuals vs actual effect. From the image, you expect it to be this powerful, devastating wave of death and destruction, but all it really does is annoy the enemy team and throw up a giant red arrow that says "CC ME YOU GUIZE!" It takes way too long to do substantial damage, and the windup time is way too long to hit the enemy with the element of surprise like you can with Kat's ult. Often times you'll get your ass stunned after the first wave of bullets, her laugh is a HUGE giveaway.   I really wish MF was as good as the other carries, since I think she brings some really interesting skills to the table. But she doesn't have the range to be a right-click champion like Cait, doesn't have the spell utility like Ashe, and she doesn't have the slipperiness of Corki or Ezreal. A huge disappointment for me.
1	We can assume that, with a 0 mph frame of reference for Solipsze, that the flash frost will be traveling at 220mph. That's a rate of 3.67 miles per minute, or 0.27 minutes per mile.
0	I wish I could upvote this more than once. I actually had someone who had gotten something for free as a promotion come in and try to return that item. I tried to tell her that since she wasn't charged for the item, I couldn't give her any money back for it. She got really mad and eventually the manager gave her a store credit for it.
1	Cass's Q has a 3-second cooldown; Morg's shield lasts 5 seconds, and has a 15-second cooldown. Until she get's nearly full CDR, Morg's shield will be down more than half of the time, and that window is wide enough for Cass to throw two Qs at her. Even while the shield is up, every Q after the first will deal damage through the shield. Also, I'm pretty sure that a reactive shield would not remove the poisoned condition, which means that Cass would be able to start wailing on you with E. Needless to say, every E would penetrate the shield.
1	Hoooooolyyy shiiiiiiit that amount of text.
1	thread is so fucking relevant, new and exciting, and pretty damn legit (and/or 'real') for just seeing the title and
1	ROFL   you're so fucking mad. yeah how dare i educate my fellow gamer about problems that are extremely common among people who spend a lot of time sitting (anterior pelvic tilt). such pseudo-intellectualism, someone with a bio B.S. degree who has done a ton of research for self-fitness purposes actually providing the correct terminology in case anyone wants to google it and learn more.   please shut up. if you think my original post was anything more than a 5-second joke, you need to stop projecting whatever fucked up ideas you have. not everyone takes the internet as seriously as you.   finally, everything i said i said with the confidence of having researched the subject for over the past two years on my own in addition to whatever basic knowledge i acquired in school. i hate pseudo-science, i and hate people like you for not knowing the difference between what's legit and what's not. a 10-second google of Anterior Pelvic Tilt would've educated you that what I am talking about is not in any way bogus, and is one of the most increasingly big problems in sedentary lifestyle first-world countries.
1	It is absolutely core on Kog'maw, first off. It is also a great item on WW because it procs on his ult, 6 times I think. It is core on Teemo, because what else do you build on him? It greatly benefits Vayne. but is not "core." Shaco uses it very well, because his ult procs it as well, making it 8% per hit. There are others were it is good, but I think that covers all the characters that have it as a core build. It is really only good for most AD carries if the enemy is stacking health, were as Black Cleaver is for armor.
1	it's dom, like it matters   but seriously this is why they need to add ranked dom so people that want to play it seriously like you can.   not me though, i play nidalee in most my dom matchs (+40 wins atm) and have fun just chucking spears all game. usually i place 1st or 2nd but i just do it for fun.   maybe you should find a character you enjoy just playing in the mean time?
1	knowing when to Baron is a decision that I think should be left to the jungler it makes it easy to decide when and when not to Baron and leaves no questions from the team. When advantage is had the most important thing is that everybody on the team move together and do the same thing.  Any jungler worth his (or her) salt should be studying gameplay and recognize what to do when. Does the jungler say Baron? No? Do something else, solves the problem right away.
1	This to me is one of the biggest problems with LoL. There are too many champions coming out too quickly. This caters to the people who are die hard LoL players, and not at all to those of us who only play a couple of times a week. This is in NO way a casual game, and that is so bittersweet. It is impossible to come back after a week of not playing when a new champ has been released, bc i can guarantee that someone int he game will pick that champ, and I will have no idea how to counter that champ.
1	I think Riot know what they are doing   Proof : This whole AMAZING game   Let them create their game at the pace they want and stop doubting them.  They never disappointed me (so far) in almost two years and since i'm playing people complain about what they are doing and about how they are doing some things.   People want a new map so bad.  Dominion is not even 1 year old and most of people I know didn't played it in month, it's gonna be the same with MagmaC. (please refer to : the TT syndrome)   People want more balance.  In the forum you see people complaining on tweaks and adjustments in every Patch Notes.   And if Riot dares to do important change (new jungle, masteries, re-work) A huge part of the community's going to complain about how things were better back then !  If riot would listen to all those posts on this subreddit or on the forum, they would be clueless about what to do.
1	Yeah, it would be awesome if before every tournament their could be a march-madness-like site where you can make your own bracket and predictions.   Also, I really like this idea but the way you have it set up is kind of annoying =/. There's too many numbers / slots and teams to keep track of. I had to pull out a piece of paper and do it there. It would be awesome if you could just "click" on which team would win each match. And then the loser bracket is automatically made from the choices you make. It's kind of hard to explain what I'm trying to say without pictures, but I don't think it would be too hard to code (I'm a web developer and webmaster of my university)
1	I'm pretty sure the math was done on this subreddit and in terms of raw damage over like 10 seconds, Vayne was #1 and then Twitch and Kog.   Bear in mind that Trist's Q only has a 35% uptime. After those 7 seconds she's doing pretty average damage because she has no other steroids. Her other spells are negligible in terms of damage, and are there solely for utility by endgame.   A champion like Vayne has 12 seconds on her ult, true damage that's strong at all stages of the game, an auto attack reset that repositions and gives 50% more damage on a super low cooldown, and a situational stun.   I'm neglecting to mention the two things that make her really strong. Her range, and the utility of her Rocket Jump and Ultimate. I believe that the reason people don't pick Trist is because they can just pick Kog'Maw and have a much stronger mid game which can snowball you to late game during which you'll most likely do more damage. The percent health shred on Kog is really good all game, his mid game is really strong because of it, and he has more range than Trist with 47% uptime. Giving him blue, which is more feasible than giving Trist blue because of the spammable nature of his spells, the uptime is about 58%. In addition, mathematically Kog is stronger in the 8 seconds of Bio Arcane Barrage than Trist is during the 7 seconds of Rapid Fire.   Now yes, Trist will maintain her 700 range after Rapid Fire ends, and Kog will go back down to 500 range when Bio Arcane Barrage ends, so after 8 seconds Trist has the advantage. The idea is that he'll do so much damage in those 8 seconds that it's worth it to pick him over Trist.   Also, upon looking at [this document]( again, and looking at slide 56 which looks at damage over the course of 10 seconds of all AD carries including all of their steroids, passives, and other buffs, it's pretty clear why you'd take Kog'Maw over Tristana. It's really quite interesting to see Tristana so low. I'm not surprised about the top 3 being Vayne, Kog, and Twitch, but it was surprising to see Miss Fortune and Sivir higher than Trist by level 18. I assume it's because of MF's impure shots passive, and Sivir's ultimate outlasting Rapid Fire. Also, I think this was from two months ago, so Sivir's ult may have been nerfed after this was released.
0	Loaded question.   No, I don't think "lesbian sex" should necessarily be threatening -- not because it's somehow less legitimate. I think there are different kinds of intimacy between men and women, women and women, and men and men; not at all more or less legitimate, but qualitatively different. So if I'm in a relationship with a girl, I'm going to expect to be a strong source of the male-female type of intimacy, but I can't expect to completely replace the female-female type of intimacy for somebody who's interested in that. Likewise, I wouldn't worry about being "replaced" by a girl, because obviously the girl I'm with already has an appetite for the male-female type of intimacy, which a girl wouldn't be able to completely replace either.
1	As a main jungler who plays Shaco and all the standard junglers, I feel like you make a valid point. Shaco does have a role late game; whether it be split pushing, soloing baron, or attempting to assasinate the enemy AD / AP Carry. However, compared to the other tanky DPS junglers, his team fight presence is lacking incredibly late game. If you build pure damage on Shaco, he will be melted extremely quickly by the AD carry who is hitting 1k every AA. If you build tanky, he doesn't have any natural tankiness. When the enemy support, who usually does, buys oracles, his assassination attempts are foiled easily. That being said, Shaco does have a late game role; however, in a 5 v 5 team fight other junglers are much better suited to do the roles of initator, peeler, or divers.
1	it's software which is installed during the initial instalation of LoL. It has no purpose afterwards, but, it keeps on uploading data constantly, without you knowing about it, and as such it slows down your game.
1	i know this will be buried but i have games like that all the time in normals (i know you dont believe me) but im in a community that has made me able to lose 8 games in a row and admit my mistakes and still go for one more game
1	Not particularly.  It's true her skill set is great and she is still a strong champion individually.  The problem is that there are many other top laners that fill her role  better  than she does.  She gets pretty stomped on by Udyr, Lee Sin, Riven, etc. and they fill very similar roles at every point in the game.  If you enjoy Irelia by all means, go for it. Like you said, she's still pretty strong - it's just not the best choice you can make in most situations.   This is coming from someone with 150 ranked games on Irelia (and at least a few hundred normals - I usually play w/ friends) @ a ~60% win rate in season 1.  Certainly not god-like but I know Irelia pretty well.  I switched to prioritizing Udyr when I needed to fill the bruiser/carry-killer role and my win rate on him is 72% this season while doing a job that is basically identical (smothering carries and absorbing damage).  Sure, Udyr does have a few general counter picks (slows like Nunu's iceball make it hard for him to jump on carries) but you have to try pretty damn hard to lose your lane.  He beats nearly every champ top lane.
0	I do the same thing to my friend from high school, he's not the most outgoing guy, so i like to steal his jokes, say them louder, and then look him in the eyes and say 'shoulda said it louder, bro; was a good one.' I don't do this to be a scumbag though. I'm trying to teach him the lesson that you've learned, because when he's off in college, all those new people wont ever hear his quiet hilarity.
0	I don't understand. I studied from 9pm to 7am for a chem final, slept for about an hour and a half, took a different, easier final, came back and slept for a couple more hours, studied from 1pm to 7pm and took my chem final at 8:30pm. My grade on the final was a 62%. After studying for so long, I felt pretty confident and digested the information well, and no, I wasn't tired during the exam.
0	I had a professor who, at one point at the end of the year, passed out an attendance sheet saying "I won't answer questions about antibody diversity from anyone who isn't here." I figured it was no big deal for me since I was front and center of every class.   After that lesson was over, the sheet stopped coming around. I was already accepted into professional school, and that school asked me to stop by to fix some things up for next year. I told her I would be out of town on Monday, and if there's anything I need to worry about "Nope, just get the notes from someone." No problem.   After I got the notes, I stopped by her office hours for help on the material that I missed. She tried the whole "You know what I said about missing class." I told her that I had not only informed her that I would have to miss ONE class, but I sat at the front row in front of her desk. Eventually, she decided she would help me out.   HOWEVER, I paid $1000 for access to the professor and material. I don't care if I missed every fucking class all fucking year. If I walk into your office hours and there's NOONE else there, you WILL fulfill your obligation as a professor and help me on the material. I can't STAND professors that will go on diatribes about students not wanting to learn and the punish students because they judge them as not worth of their time.
0	I'm not asking you to sympathize with her. I'm just pointing out that it's not unreasonable to think she regrets not making something for herself instead of becoming dependent on someone else.   I've been completely independent, with my own job my only source of income to pay all my bills and feed myself (barely, too). I've also been completely  dependent  on someone else. I did nothing while they worked and brought in the paycheck. And to be honest, it's not a good feeling. It's nice not working at first, but in the end you just feel like you're throwing your life away. I actually got very depressed because of it. At least the experience made me appreciate work a whole lot more, so I never feel the need to complain about it. People always think they want to be able to just sit around the house and do nothing all day, but it's really not that great.
0	yeah rofl no kidding. im old enough now that my mind has a built-in bullshit filter and i skipped that paragraph after the 6th word. I actually went back and read it out of curiosity after your comment. my reaction: "oh good, my bullshit filter is still working!"
0	I have a degree in English Literature. The correct answer is ALWAYS to use the pronunciation that would make you sound like less of a douche. More often than not, this is the common pronunciation. Unless you're in a situation that necessitates absolutely correct pronunciation then you should follow your company's lead. If you're the one who says the word first, you may pronounce it however you wish. However, if somebody already set the standard you almost always will look like a huge fucking douchebag by correcting them.
1	very well put. the reason i mainly stay with tri-force is for the kiting and sustain that it gives him (Q proc sheen and slow from phage, auto, w, auto, q, auto etc). I usually don't mess around with PD because you alreay get the built in AS with tri-force, plus if you're hitting your Q's and initiate with ult, passive gives plenty of AS. I agree with you on the infinity edge though for sure, nothing makes an AD output quite like an IE.  I guess I just like to play him purely for his zone/kite abilities rather than using him as a straight up duelist. Seems like people who play him wanting super deeps go the PD/IE/LW route which serves their purpose well, though IMO, the sheen phage is to much utility to ignore on a great kite like ezreal. Cheers man!
1	I know there are many Riot employees who check Reddit and we should show them how much we appreciate their work. I'm not saying we aren't, I'm actually very satisfied with the comments on this topic about the servers being down. But it seems that The official forums are getting flooded by spoiled kids who always get what they want.
1	His passives are great, but the mana restore is very low so many Tarics just ignore the mechanic completely. Good use of that passive is part of what defines a great Taric. You should be getting as many extra auto attacks in as possible, and play with an aggressive laner who likes to push. Keeping bottom lane under the enemy's tower is a great way to deny early CS, and proper warding of the river/tribrush allows you to do this with very little risk to yourself. Any time the enemy is able to push off their tower you have the best burst support w/ DPS like Graves/Draven who have very high physical only burst that is multiplied heavily by your shatter.
1	My problem with building a new passive on Taric is that he's already quite strong.  He was originally designed as a fighter type instead of a support, and while the ult didn't carry over from that idea, the passive did.  It doesn't function in his primary role as a support, but any realistic change to his passive would be a buff, since it's really almost never relevant.  Sans hybrid/bruiser/jungler/non-support items, he doesn't attack fast enough to get regularly relevant cdr on his heal (yes, people get clutch heals sometimes, we're talking consistent help), and the mana he gets back from the hits are kinda pathetic.  The mana regen is even smaller than Kassadin's passive on his dinky little sword buff, and Taric's heal is pretty mana inefficient, considering the more popular healers like Soraka or support Kayle.  Most Taric players smack people for the damage and pretty much get mana only from towers or dragon, because pushing is not worth it and champions are better killed than leeched for mana.
1	I mean, the biggest issue is while his passive makes no sense on a support, he is still a competitive pick and seen as generally a good support in many situations. A useful passive could easily push taric into the OP territory. Its a bit of flawed game design to have a passive like that on a support. However anything else may make him too strong.
0	I've had the worse sort of issues with Pizza Hut. I ordered a pizza online, was happy, yay. After an hour goes by and no pizza has arrived, I call the store to see what's up. The girl on the phone looks up my order and then says, "Oh. We don't deliver to that area." I attempt to keep my cool as I ask her why their website would allow me to order my pizza as a delivery if that was the case, to which her response was, "I don't know." I then asked her when they were planning to call me to let me know my pizza wasn't coming. All she could offer me was a, "It's done now if you want to pick it up?" I angrily go to the location to pick up the pizza because I'm starving and don't care at this point. When the guy behind the counter hands me the pizza, he says, "That'll be $17." Apparently because the actual delivery order online couldn't be completed, they cancelled it, and thereby cancelled the payment on my debit card. Silly, angry me forgot my debit card at home on my computer desk because I was in such a hurry to gtfo and get my pizza. All I had in my wallet was a hundred dollar bill which they wouldn't accept. I had to run across the street to a gas station to make change for my cold pizza which I paid full price for. He didn't say thank you.
0	As a general manager for one of the large pizza companies please all of you hear this. Your pizza is late because we are getting destroyed at our store. If you call to complain about your pizza not being there on time just at the very least acknowledge that we are doing out absolute best to get things out of our store as quickly as possible for you we do not, at any point, intentionally delay your order. There are far too many people out there that think they are the only person ordering pizza on a Friday night no, you are not, I on average have 100+ deliveries go out every Friday night running 5-6 drivers. On average that is more than enough but, sometimes, we get a groupin of 10-15 orders literally at once that will slow us down to all living shit. Thank you my rant is now over this is just something that has been bothering me. Good day too all of you and please order from papa johns tonight tell them reddit sent you!
1	Besides the whole "snowball early, get fed hard, farm hard", and make the midgame as short as possible, other possible ways that you can prevent trist from falling behind is by having your team peel for Tristana if the enemy just rushes for her, or just avoiding engagements in the first place.  Personally, when I play with my AD carry and he plays Tristana, I try to pick a support that can either be aggressive early, or peel for him. Soraka isn't going to be able to do anything for tristana in a team fight, but alistar or janna can offer so much for the AD carry both in terms of aggression and peeling. Having champions that do better mid game, such as Cassiopeia, Nocturne, or Shen can also help cover your weaknesses.
1	support kayle works on lower elos. just Q E play agressive level 1 and zone them like hell. if they dont back off and try to farm under their turret they die to you/ad carry and you snowball. if they back off they lose farm and your carry snowballs. they dont know how to deal with that.   I did this numerous times and i had 2/3 games where I was so fed that my final build was shurelyas, black cleaver phantom dancer infinities edge berserkers greaves.
0	I don't care for Bleach but I leave it on for background noise. Full Metal, Ghost in the Shell, Cowboy Bebop, Casshern Sins, and Deadman Wonderland are all pretty fucking good though. I kinda miss Durarara!! but that's because I was too lazy to actually pay attention and finish it.
1	Whoops. Well here's what I'd recommend. Play less ARAM and more jungle. Since you seem to want to jungle, pick three champions that you like to jungle and starting jungling those champs in every normal game you can. Give it a week or two, then roll back around to ranked.
0	I think the idea is that dyed hair is more of a commitment than, say, breakfast. Granted, not a huge one, but you can't color your hair twice in one day without it being fried all to hell.  And it's safe to say that it's way more expensive and that it can be a bitch to go back to the original color.   And specifically adopting traits of other people your s/o is attracted to just seems like the mark of insecurity to me. Say your ex was a redhead; if your current gal dyed her hair to match, wouldn't that seem a little creepy?
1	I like Karma as much as anyone, but she really isn't anywhere near as good as you make her out to be.   Her sustain is pretty awful.  At level 1 it heals for about 65 hp, and you can only use it 2 times a minute until level 7.  At level 5 it does about 180 2 times every 50 seconds.   Compare to soraka who heals for about 70 at level 1 and can do it 3 times a minute, and at 5 its 350 3 times a minute.  Alistar at level 1 is 60 and its 5 times a minute and at level 5 it's 180 5 times a minute.   Soraka's heal might not be AoE but it's still much higher heals and it gives the huge armor boost which negates a ton of damage if used correctly.   So karma's sustain is far from great, the damage aspect of her Q is decent, but it's such short range that there is a good chance that if you're trying to poke with it than most of the time you're going not going to outdamage the incoming trade.  Than if you try to use your shield for more poke than lose your ability to sustain.   So the problem karma has in lane is she has the choice of being an aggresive poker with maxing her shield or a mediocre sustainer by maxing Q.  You can't really be both at the same time.   The only support role she plays well is aggressive poker, but still I'd put alistar and leona above her in terms of aggressive supports.  She also falls off really hard lategame if you build her as a support as without items her damage and heals are pretty negligible late, and she has no utily.   So I really disagree that she can just as powerful as the more common supports, the difference between karma mid and other mids is much smaller than karma support and other supports actually in my opinion.   Although with all that said play who you want, as long as you support your AD and don't just spam Q or E and steal all his farm it doesn't really matter.   Also orianna is great, people are just sceptical that people in solo Q can play her so they don't give people the benefit of the doubt.
1	This probbaly goes agaisnt what most people are saying but i havent had much succes with him since the buff. I played him 3 time(which is a sample too small to says if hes viable) and i had very little succes with him   I had a great ganks, decent clear time and insane buff control but it just wasnt enought. In the 3 games, I probbaly had something like 60% of their wraith and we went in their jungle and stole almost every single buff but i still lost 2 of them.   One game went on to long and it reached the point where i did nothing(other than a sweet Baron steal) I did no damage, they had to many ways to interupt my ult(even with banshes) and my bloodboil wasnt enought to warrant a double support.   The other game, 3 of us got caught by the tele+global combo they had and the game reverse-snowballed afer that attempt at golem   The problem is that nunu is still very high risk/low reward. You need succefully to invade to stay even with the other jungler and if you fail you can setyouserlf behind. counterjungling while behind is incredibly hard to do so you lose your main trick. Nunu is a very team reliant jungler because even if you steal every buff your mid can still lose. You cannot directly impact in the game and you can only hope you lane will do well when you give them the advantage. For that reason, i doupt he is viable in soloQ but i can see him behing a monster in competitive play   Champion like shyvana, udyr, mundo and skarner still clear way to fast and there are very little room to steal their stuff  because they glide throught the jungle dispensing death. The only thing you can actually counterjungle is their buff and after stealing the first set they jsut grouped at the buff and denied our attempt   Other champion like Nautilus, maokai, malphite, amumu generaly get most of their gold with the gp5 ad gank.  The counterjungling wont cripple them that badly and sthey still do very well with little items. Even if they only have shurelia, Hog, boots and aegis/frozen heart at the 50min mark they still have more engadge power and you cc than you do. They will win in teamfight because their ability set is better than yours   Against jungler that are farm depending(but not ultra fast)  nunu is a beast . With the help of you mid you can do insane stuff and completely denie thier jungler.  i was a against a nocturne the game i won and he couldnt do anything   I feel like Nunu is very close to viability but i needs a small boost to his consume(so it has a use lategame). Maybe a debuff that amplify damage of soemthing...
1	If you take a random sample of 100 players, games played will have a loose, but not absolute correlation with skill level. If you take a sample of 100 players at a specific elo with >40 ranked games, there will not really be a correlation between games played and actual skill level.   Games played (which wins is a proxy for) doesn't take into account experience with similar games or alternate accounts.   Thought experiment: You hit your true Elo, let's say 1500. You play 200 more games, but you win 100 and lose 100 against other people at the same rating. Why should the system regard you as stronger than you were before if you can't win more than 50% of the time against equally matched competition?
1	I know the people who hire the casters want non-stop talking.   But for what my opinion is worth, if you have nothing to say, don't talk. If you have something insiteful like "Oh wow, Morello's Evil Tome isn't a common item, let me explain why the player got this." but when it's crap like "Well Graves has built some attack damage, he's sure going to want to do some damage to people!"  Yeah. No shit.
1	We can only evaluate what evidence we have. At the moment, men are the better casters, just because there might eventually maybe be one female caster who isnt shitty, doesnt mean we can't say that the ones we have at the minute are.   I was not saying that these casters are shitty because they are women (apologies if I worded it wrong and implied this) I was saying that they are shitty, and as are all female casters in the industry.   Personally I would take a Moletrap / Hatperson duo cast over any cast with Jade or Kara on. At least Moletrap and Hatperson are energetic (or try to be)
1	Not this again... It is really a bad idea and you should know that if you saw other threads like this!   FOR ALL LAZY ONES!
1	I've done some digging, since there's not much else to do at work anyway, and found no real / actual percentages. But did find some posts where it is estimated that the difference can amount to +50 to +100 elo matchups in a team.   Riot's official statement is the following (from their [FAQ](   At its core, comparing the Elo rating of two players will give you a rough idea of who is more likely to win a match. In the case of Solo/Duo Queue, the ratings of each team member are aggregated. The greater the differential between the two ratings, the more strongly the odds favor the higher rated team of players. In the Ranked Team Queue, your rating will reflect your team’s performance as a single entity, and will not reflect your personal rating.   The rest of the info I found in several forum posts, [here]( [here]( and [here](
1	Jax is broken as fuck. He beats everyone in lane with the exception of Malphite (There might be some unknown counters that people dont use, enlighten me please.). And against malphite it's actually possible to do good aswell.   I would like to see a nerf on his ulti 3rd strike damage, it is simply too high :(
1	I have played a shitton of Jax, and he is by far my favorite characters in league, and one of the reasons I enjoy the game so much. With that said, I would like to discuss an alternative AP based Jax build involving stuff like lichbane, rylais, gunblade and dcap. I've played him that way a couple of times against AP heavy teames, and while it's not quite as viable in most situations; Holy shit is it ever fun. Turns him into a burst champ that can blow someones HP bar to null every three or four seconds when spells come off cd. Downsides are not getting as tanky as the AD/ Hybrid builds, but you can't have everything now can you?
1	While this isn't useless information, you've taken zero account of how stats scale, which dramatically affects their gold efficiency. Take Mana Manipulator for example, it might look awesomely gold efficient until you realise that every point of mana regen you buy past the point you don't run out of mana is entirely wasted, and most champions reach that point very easily just by leveling or other standard build paths, so the scaling of the stat falls off a cliff. And there are more complex examples, particularly with AD stats like AS and crit which interact so that their gold efficiency is dependent on how much you have of other stats, leading to a complex series of breakpoints for gold efficiency (relative to effect size) I've yet to see anyone bother to explore.
0	Actually, you can't say homosexuality has nothing to do with evolution. Just the mere fact that there's a fairly persistent genetic predisposition that exists suggests that it's most likely driven by evolution. Many scientists have suggested that the reason why it has persisted in not only humans, but many other species, is because of kin selection.
0	Oh, there's no doubt in my mind it's biological. I don't think it's genetic, but rather impacted by environments during prenatal development. See, males and females have different hormones released during development. Males require androgens that get converted into estradiol (yes, an estrogen) while females don't need hormones as a human's "default sex" is female. Well, there is something known as the fraternal birth order that showed the more male children a female has given birth to, the more likely the subsequent male will be homosexual. It's not really well understood why this is, but we know it happens. It's thought that maternal antibodies try to breakdown the testicular testosterone produced by the baby. The more male children she's had, the better her immune system is at getting rid of it.   Homosexual males also show morphological differences from heterosexual males. An area of the brain called the 3rd Interstitial Nucleus of the Anterior Hypothalamus (INAH-3) is similar sizes in hetero women and homosexual men, both of which is smaller than heterosexual males. This area is part of the Sexually Dimorphic Nucleus (different between sexes) and has been implicated in partner preference. Another area of the brain, the Suprachiasmic Nucleus (SCN), is twice as large in homosexual males than heterosexual males, which is larger than a female SCN. It is unclear how this area of the brain impacts behavior. Homosexual males also have higher levels of circulating androgens as an adult and larger penises (on average) than heterosexual males.
1	What's ridiculous is how many people are giving MLG/Riot the benefit of the doubt.   It makes absolutely no sense that any team would publicly talk about how they are going to split prizes---especially when in terms of motivation, both teams have incentive to win 1st place more than 2nd place.   Collusion and/or prize splitting agreements happen with teams who are still seeding or in the lower brackets, to increase their chances of gaining money. The EG + TSM collusion accusation in Dreamhack 2011 had way more evidence.  Such collusion or prize splitting doesn't happen between 1st and 2nd place teams.
1	Here is when you can justify promote... if you know your team is coordinated enough to exploit an advantage of forcing a one player on their team to another lane for about 15 seconds tops...   CLG can use this and they can be very good with it because if they force someone to clear another lane or lose a tower, it gives CLG about 30 seconds total (with travel time) to push 4v5, now in soloque with 5 people, usually thats still not even enough to just outright win, especially if you arn't coordinated.   Its not that you can't ever take promote. Its that in soloque, taking promote is saying "my team is good enough and coordinated enough to exploit a very brief period where we can force a 4v5." or... "Their team is dumb enough that I can promote a cannon minion and take a tower for a summoner spell."   I think in general, most people wouldn't say their teams are coordinated enough to do that in solo que.   In reality its not a bad summoner for competitive play. It is however an early game summoner, it allows for interesting early game strategies, but falls off super super hard late game compared to exhaust (which I think is fair to compare promote to on a support)   I do actually think that promote is a VERY good summoner in the low elo  - 1200 range. I find that in that range people tend to view lanes as "its your lane not mine." Until about 20 minutes. If you took like nunu + graves / corki / ez / sivir (or sona with any of those four as well) and with promote, you can take early and even get to inner tower, and with that you can also take such hard dragon control that through bot lane you can carry super super hard.
1	I think this speaks to a much larger issue that many players at my (low) elo have.  I don't really know, because I haven't been playing LoL very long, but I assume it goes up to about 2000 elo.  The problem I'm talking about is lack of thought.  This applies to banning/picking/building/overall team comps.  So often I'll see people do things a certain way just because that's what they saw the pros do.  Or I'll see people get mad at someone(usually me) for trying to do something that they have yet to see a pro do.  Yes, the people who get paid to play this game are probably the best at it.  Does that mean that their word is gospel?  Absolutely not.  Innovation can come from CLG, or it can come from elo hell.  The same thing applies to misuse of innovation.  I'm sure everyone here has at one time played with a Froggenivia when you had a tank top and tank jungle.  This kind of blind, following attitude is the cancer that is killing League.
1	oh yeah? sounds more like you're jealous of a measly $160   >there are hundreds of people trying to start up their own streams and channels   perhaps they should HUSTLE HARDER and try to stand out instead of having fuckboys white knight for them on the internet.
1	Oops. Never played it. My bad :3
1	perhaps they should STEAL OTHER PEOPLE'S CONTENT   FTFY
1	it's also funny when idiots like you miss the point and think it's all about the money
1	Playing Nocturne in a lane isn't all that hard. The key is to learn how to stop and last hit. Nocturne makes it so easy to last hit. I've done both mid and top several times.   I use spacebar for my stop, and I just stay behind the melee minions. If one of their caster minions is about to die, I Q it. If one if the melee minions is about to die, I last hit AA it, or any minion close to do the AOE damage. If you really have to, Q to avoid unit collision, then AA with Umbra. But don't push. On top, get Unspeakable first and fear the top laner when he tries to last hit. On mid, get Shroud to block the spells when able.   Stay conservative; realize how easy it is to push your lane. On top, you have nothing to fall back on if you push too hard. Mid is trickier, but if you push, you can steal their wraiths ( and your wraiths and wolves, if you have no jungler.) If you don't have a jungler, you still kind of fit that role, so enjoy the bounty of neutral minions, and love life. If you have a jungler, then stay back, wait for the signal, and initiate the gank with Q into E.   Item wise, it's really up to you. I love an assassin based build, but it's generally not feasible to work with team comp. So start with boots and 3 pots, build into HoG, then either Wriggles or Madred's Razors and Vamp Scepter (you'll build them into a Bloodrazor and BloodThirster,  Wit's End, Frozen Mallet, the BR and BT from above, and AotL. Build these in order depending on your enemy. EDIT: If they go armor, Prioitize a Black Cleaver in replace of BT, BR, or AotL, depending on your preference.   I go 9/21/0 and use Ignite/Flash and CV, but that's just me. I love seeing them run out of view, CVing them, then ulting for the kill. But that's just me. If you don't, ignite and your choice, everyone loves a flash.   One last thing; Although you don't like to jungle, pushing your lane hard at the beginning will set you up to roam, which IS what Nocturne does best. Wards are your friends, both to see ganks coming, and to pick out an out of place carry who begs to be taught a lesson.
1	Is it really necessary for escapes on EVERY hero? I mean even though the recent ap heroes that have been released all have one. Doesn't mean Heimer is completely unviable. Just means you need to put your patience and planning into your escape routes rather then running straight towards tower and dying saying its Heimers fault.
1	Heimerdinger's lack of escape can be countered by taking Ghost and Flash.   I play a lot of heimerdinger on dominion where he actually works. All he really needs is for his W to prioritize Champions and his turrets to scale on Heimers Health and I'll gladly take him into Summoners Rift.
1	Dominion is my preferred playstyle, and I only pull Heimer out when I'm frustrated and just need a win. He's so strong there that I get bored playing him with any frequency.   I've never found him to fall off. If anything I find him growing in relative strength as he gains AP.   If your team behaves themselves and stay top, you basically win the game single handedly. The enemy team has to either send 2 people bot or you will push to their turret and cap it. I've yet to see someone who could keep me off their bottom tower solo.   Here are some of my keys to making him work.   The first is to have the other four players on your team leave you alone, even if you lose your bot tower (this usually happens if they send 3 or more bot to gank). Defending on a tower with Heimer is incredible, and on the off chance that you lose it, taking the bottom tower on your side back is almost trivial, especially with promote. The only Dominion games I lose as Heimer are when someone else on my team thinks they have to come bottom and leave top undermanned. I'll swap to top if they persist after being told multiple times to stay top, but usually if someone is bad enough to ignore calls for team coordination they're usually far too bad to hold bot, even against a single opponent.   The second key is to not die. I know that's pretty standard advice for LoL, but it's generally less important in Dominion. Taking Heimer solo bottom is an exception.   If you only have one opponent bottom you want to be sure you're always pushing the lane. This is trivial to do. Make sure when you're laning against someone that you put your turret at the top of the lane in the gap, so you're controlling access to the heal buff between the towers. If they want to play hide and seek in the bottom bushes you can grenade them pretty much at will or look for an opportunity to place your second turret there. The problem comes when you're laning against more than one person or one of the champs that gives Heimer issues due to range etc. In that case you want to play more defensively, and if they've sent two champs you'll generally want to just sit on your own tower. You don't need to push if they send two down, since that makes it 3v4 top. If it's a single champ that just gives you trouble, unless they have HUGE sustainability you can operate basically from your own tower, using promote, grenades, and turrets to keep the lane pushing. Use rockets to harass and eventually they'll get low enough you can push and kill them or they'll have to go back to heal. If they leave lane due to death or to heal, Heimer can push the lane quickly enough that your minions should start capping their tower before they get back. Once you've pushed far enough, just leave. They'll have to take the time to clear the tower and the minions are often enough to take it neutral all by themselves. That's enough pressure to make the enemy team weak up top.   The biggest mistake I see Heimers make bottom is trying to hold the enemy's bot tower or getting cocky and trying to engage against more than one opponent. While you can frequently be successful in both of those scenarios it's far more likely that you'll get killed, and later in a Dominion game that will generally mean that your tower gets capped before you come back up. This pretty much means you're going to have at least one teammate head down there, and that will often cost you top.   I always take Promote and Ghost, and I use the summoner cooldown reduction masteries in the utility tree. With that combination I can usually wait on boots so that I have more pushing power in lane and having it makes a real difference having Promote up more often.   You have to get used to predictive grenade use and you have to be aware when your rockets will hit the enemy champ and when the minions will simply suck them up. You also want to be very careful about using your ult, and using up all of your turrets.   As a general rule unless I'm dominating my opponent I never push unless I am able to drop a turret. I also reserve my ult for when someone tries to gank. You simply don't need it to keep the lane moving.   If you drop both turrets and push before you have a new one ready to go, you're asking for trouble, and the slow on your ult, while relatively weak, will almost always give you enough space for ghost to do it's job and get you back to your tower.   Opponents tend to underestimate the stun on the grenade. If you have two towers up and someone tries to come in on you landing the grenade is basically a guaranteed kill.   Practice kiting opponents while keeping them in range of your turrets, and be aware of when your turrets are focused on minions. A quick rocket flurry to clear a wave and free your turrets up to target the opponent diving you can make all the difference.   It takes some practice to use Heimer, and taking him bot in Dominion is no different. If you stick with it though, you'll find yourself winning far more than you lose.   The strategy and positioning needed make it a lot of fun for me in short bursts, especially against other Heimers. If you have any questions I'd love to answer them. It would also be great if any other Heimer players had suggestions for me to up my game :)
1	I certainly wasn't trying to condescend. If you feel that my attitude was patronizing, I unconditionally apologize. In my view we're all peers here, and my elo testifies that I'm a total scrub. That's one of the reasons I play so much Dominion.   I took the time I did to write a wall of text because I'm passionate about Heimer. I could see you feel strongly about him as well, and I was more looking to compare notes with another experienced Heimer player.   Regarding ganks, my experience has been very different from yours :(   Just like you I generally push and take their bottom tower at the beginning. Depending on who they have sent bot I usually will retreat and give it up to them, then push it again. Wash, rinse, repeat.   My goal is to keep pressure on their bottom tower, not necessarily take it. I generally avoid engaging with the enemy player except to harass, and if I stay behind my turrets I can do more damage to their minions than they can do to mine. I usually end the game with 5 or 6 kills, and 4 or 5 deaths. Maybe a few assists. I play very safe, and don't push past the mid point unless I'm confident they don't have anyone in a position to come through the gap and wreck me.   It's not that I never get ganked, or never lose my tower. It happens. But I'm almost always able to beat them up enough that it's relatively trivial to push them off it when I come back up.   I always wait for a minion wave and as I mentioned I use my missiles to harass. The reason that I don't feel Heimer falls off is that the more AP I build, the better my harass gets and the harder it is for people to trade with me. I make sure to build penetration as needed, and the key is largely not to overextend. If the enemy even looks like they're going to bypass the minions to engage with me then I pull back, to the tower if needed. If they dive me, worst case is I die and they're at 10% health. Once I rez I simply wait for a minion wave from my mid tower and push them off it again. They'll have to either die or recall and Heimer clears waves so quickly that I'll have minions on their tower before they can get back.   It might be considered a stalemate, I guess, but in my experience I'm generally always pushing and denying them much farm. I find that my opponent bot is generally LESS farmed/fed than the rest of their team.   This all goes out the window when there's more than one person sent bot. In that case I'll usually just sit on the tower. If they send more than one bottom, unless your team is completely incompetent, you win. All you have to do is slow them down enough that the rest of your team can take and hold the windmill.   It sounds like you know all this, so I guess I can't explain why he works so well for me, but you have a different experience. Maybe it's the item build? I just don't know.   I start with the chalice for mana regen, and either boots if I feel like mobility is important or more usually a tome for additional pushing power. As I mentioned I go with magic pen reds, armor yellows, and ap blues and quints. For masteries I take utility for summoner cooldown reduction and put the rest in offense. My goal with items is to max CDR and then it's pretty much all AP. Depending on how the game is going I'll either grab a Kage's, rush a Deathcap, or finish out the chalice. The Chalice is the only "core" item, for the rest sometimes I go to a magic pen rod, sometimes I'll build a mask.   At the end of the day, I guess I've written so much because I want you to have as much fun with him as I'm having.   Let me reiterate that my the last thing I want is to imply that I'm somehow better. My posts are all about explaining to you, and maybe someone else who might want to play Heimer how I do it. Nothing more.   Just like I put at the end of my other post, I'd love to get some feedback. I love /r/leagueoflegends because of how much I learn here. The only reason that I've spent the time that I have responding is to try and give something back.   I apologize for any offense given, and hope to see you on the field of battle.
0	Hello very religious Christian here and all I want to say is, whatever. I accept all people wen if they say my religion is full of crap. In my mind I see that everyone is gods children and we should respect their views and beliefs. But it makes me sad when Christians go insane when someone says they're atheist, muslim, etc. Because it makes the rest of us look bad and we make enemies that way. I don't really care what anyone in r/atheism says because that's their beliefs and I have mine... Can't we all just except that?
0	Most companies are complete crap. I worked for 3 weeks at Northwestern Mutual over summer, which is considered #1 for life insurance (based on their credit rating, average payout on claim, dividends) and fucking hated it. They don't pay you ("you're not an employee, you're an agent of the company") so you really need to whore yourself pretty hard if you want to make any money. Everyone (at least that in my office) who was successful was a complete tool. Highly educated (most people in my office went to Stanford or somewhere else private) and hated anything relating to Barack Obama or economic redistribution. Very conservative, very douchy (sp?) crowd.
1	Except games still had to be remade at  TI2 . Morph had just got a mega kill and the game crashed, and they found that the server that made backups lost power.
1	I'm a huge fan of the little bits of lore that was put into the new TT map. I didn't really follow tJoJ because the amount of text really put me off to it (sorry!). But! I always love whenever there's a new champion and there's a little comic that gets released prior to the champion.   Basically, I would LOVE to see some type of comic series that help with the lore. Even if it's just a couple of panels that come out every so often.. (I'm particularly interested in the Shadow Isles lore and the story between Leona and Diana and what could potentially happen between them)
1	I would just like to say that I hate the altars, and I will give some reasons why so it can be constructively said.   1) In solo que, altars are an absolute nightmare. if teammates don't respond to pings, and timers, you are boned. 2) The timer is so short - every 90 seconds? I want to be killing champs, getting money, assaulting turrets, etc. Not capturing altars. Dominion is capture and hold. That is what it is for. 3) Twisted treeline is a lot more reliant on personal skill then Summoners rift. No wards, plus the limited altar vision, causes a lot more ganks and fights to happen. For someone playing an ad carry or mage without an easy escape, this is extremely frustrating because there is literally no counterplay.
1	Do you guys plan on expanding the universe of the shadow isles with other maps to play?   For instance, considering whats been said by the lore and the speculations that have been made in the forums... Do you guys plan on making an instance theme'd run?   Something along the lines of two teams attempting to reach a goal within the center, (i.e. one team is attempting to revive the king and the other team is attempting to prevent it by sealing). Where in which both teams will have to go through a series of mini bosses or other types of obstacles that would obstruct them from their goals?   I'm really interested in the lore of the shadow isles and I feel like the new TT cannot flesh out the story beyond what the map offers.  LoL is in this position where instances can be made due to the progressive leveling system of the champions. This gives it the ability to create a variety of different modes to play within without having to implement different mechanics.
1	It is actually. &#3232;_&#3232; When psychologists treat someone with a phobia, they use exposure therapy to help lessen the severity of it. People who suffer from severe arachnophobia often can't even look at a picture of a spider without experiencing extreme anxiety and fear. When they're being treated, the first step in exposure therapy is then trying to desensitize them by increasing their exposure to spiders (in this case). They start out slow, say by showing them a picture of a cartoon spider, and they increase from there. Next would be a picture of a real spider, etc. So, yes, fear of spiders on a screen is a legitimate fear for someone with a phobia.
1	Played together in a custom game with 2 friends of mine, me + 1 friend against the 2nd friend (who introduced us both.) This is the story.   While I was downloading and installing League I was looking at all the champions, read lores etc to see if any champion interested me (there was 40 champions out at the time) I decided to play either Teemo or Nunu, I finally decided to play Nunu when I entered champion select (back then all champions were free and there was no shop system or IP as the game just had been released officially)   I didn't change my summoner spells or anything so I had Revive + Heal and I didn't know about masteries either so I couldn't put my 1 point into the page.   Anyways, I am feeling pumped to play this game as my friends say it's pretty darn fun and I had been skyping with them for a few hours before they convinced me to actually play it so I was pretty darn excited to try it myself, pvp.net minimizes and the League of Legends logo pops up but nothing else, I ask my friends if this is intended and they tell me to be patient, I wait for 2 minutes and my friend finally realizes that you have to install Adobe Air manually to actually play the game. Great to know, thanks. So I hurry and try to get the right version of Adobe air and after a few tries I get it right, but it takes a long time for me to fix it properly.   25 Minutes later I get into the loading screen and I am pumped to play, get into the game and I see our base (it was on Twisted treeline) overflowing with blue minions, including a few bigger ones. I kind of know what my abilities already does as I read about it before so I level up my Consume and get to business, I take agro of one of the big blue guys and actually use my heal just to kill it (with the help of my minions) and I am thrilled so I yell out "I killled you!!" thinking it was my friend who was the big blue dude, turns out it was just a super creep and I had just used 20 seconds to kill it. I get a bit demoralized from this first experience and a few minutes later we lose the game.   Needless to say I am a bit disappointed of the first 5 minutes of playing the game but I say I'll give it 1 more try.   3 years later, over 7000 games and here I am. My second game was obviously much more thrilling than my first was but it's still a good memory. I am very happy to still be a part of this.
1	I remember my first game vividly. It was a custom game with two of my friends. I had absolutely no idea what I was doing and my friends really didn't explain anything about anything to me. Out of the free week champions that were available at the time I picked Veigar because I thought it was a good idea at the time. He looked all magical and stuff, why not?   So as the game is loading, I open up a wiki page on Veigar on my second monitor, so I can see details about him while I am in game. This is something I did a lot while I was learning the game. We get in game, I pick up my Doran's ring first and get a point in my Q. I go bottom lane because they told me too, and they go off somewhere else. I didn't know where, because you know, what is map awareness?   I'm sitting there for a bit and then here comes Soraka Bot down the lane. I'm thinking I can take her straight up 1v1 at level 1. I  click  on my Q and then  click  on Soraka Bot. PSHEUUW, TAKE THAT SORAKA! But now she starts throwing terror bananas at me, and there's some...like...star things...coming from the sky! I strike back with my own attacks, but suddenly these weird little creatures are throwing sparkles at me from nearby. Odds were not in my favor, and I quickly died to Soraka Bots unrelenting banana assault.   "Guys...I think I just died to that thing. What happened? Why did I lose that?"   AH HA HA HA LOL DUDE X, DID YOU SEE THAT? HE DIED TO SORAKA, FUCKING SORAKA MAN!   OH MY GOD HA HA HA MY FUCKING SIDES HOW CAN YOU DIE TO A HEALER? HA HA HA YOU DIED TO A HEALER!   "I don't understand, what is she-"   HA HA HA HA HA HA HA   (¬_¬)   So I'm back alive now and I get back to bottom lane, where the banana monster and the sparkle creatures live, and I decide to just auto attack minions because I have no idea what I should be doing at the moment. I'm pushing and pushing, but I have to recall sometimes because of damage from the banana monster and the sparkle creatures, and I didn't know what I was supposed to do about them.   I tried throwing my Event Horizon on the banana monster, but she stood perfectly in the center auto attacking minions, even though I had just thrown up a huge cage...thing! And the cage did nothing! It was at this point I realized that my attacks were useless against the powerful banana monster, and my best chance was to try to level up and pray that my friends were strong enough to defeat this demon, because I couldn't do a damn thing.   I have about one or two thousand gold now, but I haven't bought any items. I still got my Doran's ring and that was it. I recall and go back to lane when I get asked a question.   Why didn't you buy anything at the base?   "What do you mean?"   You have money right? You buy more stuff with it, obviously.   Well if I didn't do that, it must not be so obvious. "Are items really that important?"   Uh yeah, they are kinda a huge deal. Really important actually.  One of them chuckles in the background.   "Okay, well I'll go back then. What do I even get?"   After a discussion, I get boots and a Tear of the Goddess. Feeling more powerful (even though I don't actually have any more damage), I go back to bottom lane, but something is wrong. My tower is missing! It was just here a second ago...where did it go? Did the banana monster steal it? Because if she stole it, I was going to need more help than I thought before.   Wow, you lost the tower to Soraka? Oh my god you're so bad...   Yeah no kidding. But they said I lost it, so that demon probably didn't steal it. Had to be my fault. But if I lost it, maybe I can go find it again? I knew what I was going to do next.   One of my friends mentions that they just hit a level. I don't remember which, but I do remember that the level they just reached was higher than mine. I question this.   "How are you leveling up so fast? I'm not even close to your level."   Oh he's jungling. Has been the whole time.   "Jungling? What's that?"   It's a thing where instead of being in a lane like you are, you go into this jungle area here and kill the monsters in there.   "Oh ok...can I do that?"   LOL HA HA HA HEY DUDE X, HE SAYS HE WANTS TO JUNGLE VEIGAR! HA HA HA   OH AH HA HA HA HA! I HAVEN'T LAUGHED THAT HARD IN A LONG TIME!   "I don't get it why can't I-"   AH HA HA HA HA   ｏ( > <)o   To be fair, this was back before the new, easier jungle we have in season two. Still though, I didn't understand what the problem was. I decided it was probably best to just stay in my lane and find my tower again.   Then here comes this green dog thing from no where. It gets really big and kills the banana monster in no time. Wow! So powerful! What is that? Who was that?   Ha ha how were you having trouble against that?   "I don't know."   It's a healer! And you're Veigar!   "Yeah, but-"   But nothing!   At this point I pretty much realized that they were not going to explain anything, so I just asked them what things were, and then looked them up on the [Wiki.](   We did eventually win, and while I never found my tower and got neglected pretty much the whole game, the banana monster lost. That made it all worth it. We beat the banana monster! Yes! And almost two years and over 2k games later, I'm still playing.   And I still hate Soraka.
1	Once upon a time, in the summer of this year, I was 2223 Elo. Magically, after a long vacation, I dropped over 300 Elo in a single week. Then, Riot reset the highest ratings. Struggled to get my play back in shape, and finally got diamond last week.
1	I think duo-ing greatly increase your chance of winning. You get at least 2 solid players that can play decently.   I'm currently trying to get higher by playing duo as much as possible
1	I finished season 2 with a shitty rating (~700)   I am now approaching silver with around 1050 rating right now. I for one am looking forward to playing with them, because if they abuse me for my lack of a border, it just makes it even more fun to beat them and watch the whine. and if I get to gold this season, and I end up getting abused for not having a border, it will just motivate me to play better.   the way I see it. If you don't had a lower rating than them last season, but earned your place amongst them this season, then fair play. You earned your right to be up there playing with them, if they abuse you for it, then more fool them.
1	As a plat who is currently sitting in the middle of golds and occasionally silvers (and actually unrankeds too)...   If you live up to the ELO bracket that you are at, we won't complain.   Usually the first thing I call out a silver bracket player for is their attitude in game. The amount of complaining on average. When somebody suggests trundle support, instant complaining. Gold players might say that it's stupid, and plat players might say "no" or just not anything at all, but silver players will cry about it instantly.   The next thing is map awareness and throws and the like. At higher ELOs, we expect big macro game decisions to be obvious (and tbh, this is the most identifying factor of elo brackets last season), and when a game is thrown because your silver player keeps getting caught with his pants down late game or seen bot lane when baron's up or refuses to back/heal/buy before the other team rushes baron because he wants to farm jungle, it is actually the silver player's fault and this type of inconsistency in the games irks us to the greatest degree.   The same shit also applies to mechanics that should have been learned (a move is the main one here, but stuff like poorly timed (read impatient) AoE ults count too). If we lose a teamfight because your silver player who belongs in silver doesn't know how to teamfight....   To me, at least for the first few weeks, I will judge you by your badge first, then your s3 elo. Last season I climbed to plat twice, and the elo reset didn't magically make silver or gold players better.   so yea
1	Yes, but I'm kinda worried about getting banned because I get reported as someone who is 'refusing to communicate', which is probably what would happen after a while. And if I leave the chat the way it is, I have to somehow participate in it at one point in the game. So, either way, bans are a 100% sure thing to get, no matter what. huehuehe   No, seriously now, I have made very good experiences with at least trying to lead by good example and make the players come down from their tilt/rage and tell them to stop worrying and flaming and that we still have a chance (obviously doesn't work if we get stomped hard for 20 minutes straight). If it wouldn't be so darn tiring to keep up with those kids I'd do it in every game.   Oh, and making calls if you are doing well is good too and most people will listen to you if you are the best player in the team of any given match. Also complimenting by saying gj or wp to people who make a comeback after they've died a few times can work wonders too.
1	Well, I guess then Sundance should take a look @ tales of the lane (which had better production value, atleast in my opinion) and other bigger tourneys which probably run at a fraction of the costs MLG has.
1	It really depends.  Sometimes you should camp a lane, sometimes you should just stand in a lane and push with your laner, and other times you should be everywhere on the map.  It really depends on the lane match up and the jungler you picked.   I don't want to type too much but I'll give two examples to show how you need to adapt to your character and the game.     Say you are olaf jungle.  Your other lanes are getting destroyed.  Not so much that they instadie to the other laner, but so much that they cant leave tower.  Now sometimes it might be helpful to gank for them.  But in this particular situation the lanes were so far gone that me trying to help them was pointless.  What I did was went top lane with our nidalee who was doing alright and I basically laned with her.  We just kept shoving down top and they couldnt stop us without sending 3+ people.  We destroyed them in a 2v2 top/jungler vs top/jungler since our combo was so strong.  This forced their mid to leave and basically let ours kill tower and roam.  We caught up in gold and won the game even though the enemy bot lane was up 4-5 kills and tower diving ours.     The next example is a nunu game.  Basically your goal is to make their jungler non-existant.  If he ganks you counter gank.  If he does something you screw him over hard for it.  You make it so he cant move.  If somehow via the enemy team out playing your laners or you letting their jungler gank end up with you and your team being behind, you won't be able to pull the same cheeky push top and win strategy that olaf/nid used to win in the earlier game.  So in this situation how you tackle the game is totally different.  You need to look for opportunities to give your team an advantage.  Sneaking early dragons or stealing blue from the enemy are all things you can do to try and come back.  However the biggest thing you can do to change the game is buy lots of wards for everyone and counter gank their jungler.  This will take a lot of effort on your part to explain to your team.  But basically if you are still close enough in the game to win a 2v2 when they overextend for a kill then this will work and is your best bet to win in a situation like this.  Ward up and have your laner bait a gank.  Then show up to counter gank and generally you will get a double kill or a spree and sometimes a dragon out of it.       Each of these situations is totally different because of the champions that are being used in the jungle and in other lanes.  It's not something you can just say do x or do y, but in a detailed description of something/replay you can usually work out the correct answer to winning or to camping.
1	I think this comes down to matchup - helping out a 2/0 Jayce is not worth it if they have a 2/0 Vayne  But if it is a Jax? Then yea, go for it.  Also this comes down to lanes - top is very snowbally, so if you get them two kills they should nearly always win their lane; there isn't much reason to go back after that unless it is for a countergank  For mid you have to understand who you can gank and who you can't - it's rarely worth trying to gank a Morgana, for instance, but a Morde is a must gank in the early levels. It's rarely worth ganking for a Karthus, as he can just farm, but an Ahri may really need them kills early to 100-0 someone in a teamfight  Bot lane depends on the matchup, but it is always worth going down there a few times. Ultimately, the AD is the most important person on your team, and getting him ahead is always getting your team ahead. You should especially help out when your support has an easy set up for you - Zyra ult, Taric stun, Vayne condemn etc. Also remember that whenever you are bot you are near dragon, and any clean kill can be converted into 1k gold for your team, which benefits everyone
1	If you shut down anybody and stop their gold income they're useless. This is no different when it comes to Rengar. Yes he's strong, yes once you get a Trinity Force on him (just like Jax and Poppy) he gets Tanky. Get over it.
1	Scenario: you win your lane against Irelia. You have a few kills on her, taken her tower and about 60 minions more than her. Now you decide to take that advantage to your team - gank mid/bot and take a dragon, you might even push down some more towers for the gold advantage. Skip 10 minutes ahead : team fights. Now Irelia have gotten some farm while you were off helping your team, which means she has become the tank with high damage. You said she doesn't do a lot of  damage, but she really does. 75 truedamage + sustain is one of the best abilities in the game. Build tanky and melt the enemy away with next to none damage items.
1	Focus the one that is easier to attack for you and your support meaning when you are laning your focus should be     CS   Poke Enemy ADC   Poke Enemy Support     Now when you take these decisions it is up to you and your support should be ready to support you with these.   About the tanky support's its much better when you peel them off that means when their initate can't be covered up or its hardly being covered and you move back while hitting the support in the back, though you can also think about the enemy ADC if he goes full in you rather fight them or peel off.   Taking an example of an enemy lane of Leona & Corki, if Corki uses his Valkyrie to join the Leona's Burst its better when you Peel Off and Attack the Corki when he is going back, if Corki doesn't use Valkyrie you Peel off And Hit the Leona, of course these should happen if you peel off good and you are healthy enough to fight them back.   About exhaust a support should never use it on the other support unless the enemy support is running under his turret w/o flash and it is for securing a kill.   Me as an ADC can say this much but the time of exhaust is up to support though ADC Champs are based on burst or on their DPS damage, aka if a Corki dives in its better to exhaust him directly to not proc Leonas Passives for Full Damage in between his auto attacks.
1	When you play support, you're trying to be as aggressive as possible without getting out of position.  This means that you will likely be positioned slightly in front of your ADC, especially if you're ranged and they're not Blitz/Leona.  Note that this goes for both sides, so the supports will be closer to each other than to the ADCs, and so they will be focusing a lot of their harass on each other.  This does not mean that Lulu should burn her W on the enemy Sona, but it definitely does mean that Sona should burn her Q + Qchord on the enemy Janna, even if a lot of that damage is reduced by the shield (at early levels; later, she stops being able to 1shot the shield).  Yes, of course you would rather attack the enemy ADC, but the only way that you will be able to is if either you are running up with your support to allin (or to push them off, but remember that running up can easily result in an allin so make sure you're ready for that) or if the enemy support sucks.
1	In regards to Diana, although her clear times are top notch and her potential is amazing, her potential is being wasted in the jungle. She's much better at trading, scales better with good farm and items, and, overall, belongs in mid lane more than jungle. She doesn't fit the meta of a "tanky DPS bruiser" in the jungle that really defines the jungle role atm.   I use a custom rune page on her (Armor marks, Mana Regen seals, Flat AP Quints, Flat MR Glyphs) when I tried jungling her.   When comparing her to Lee Sin and Nocturne, the biggest issue I see with her is dueling. Nocturne and Lee Sin are both AMAZING duelists in the jungle, able to 1v1 almost any champion in the game succesfully; whereas, champions like Diana and Darius, who have amazing clear times and base damage, are not duelists and more traders who belong in lane.   Lee Sin, Skarner, and Maokai are all amazing picks. If I would recommend a jungler for S3 right now, it would be Nocturne. Farm till 6 and abuse new jungle farm after 11 minutes, then get free kills with your ultimate as you hit 6 before anyone else in the game.
1	Let's go through some basic assumptions then. Let's assume the following things.     Games are different with different champions and different abilities on either sides.     You can't control how much specific damage your team will do to the buff, vice-versa with the enemy buff, with 100% predictability.       Under those two assumptions, it's safe to say that by getting damage on early buff and wolves; it would create irregular data. Irregular data is pointless and unreliable.   So, the only way we can get standardized data which can be used to compare junglers would be to get it without any other factors. This way junglers' ability, albeit not entirely practical, will be compared with another junglers' ability on an equal level.   In regards to how the data can be interpreted effectively, it can be used to address how changes to jungle can effect clear times, or which junglers use the least amount of health to do camps, or which junglers deal the most damage, or which junglers can be the most reliable even when occasions where you don't get a leash arise.   Of course, you can make an argument that the data can't be used to address viability; however, there are often times that junglers may have to do buffs themselves without the team in the case of a jungle defence / scout / late invade (often done by pro teams). In these cases, knowing which junglers can successfully clear a jungle safely without dieing to camps is extremely helpful.   Moreover, the data can be used to compare how junglers fair against other junglers in terms of clear time. Assuming junglers get the SAME leash, then junglers should be able to clear JUST as fast or faster than without a leash. Clear times can just be subtracted from how much time was reduced from the leash on both sides. If the argument is made that one jungler gets a really strong pull and the other jungler gets a really weak pull, then that's an uncontrollable factor in the equation that's incalculable.   If you have good understanding of clear times, even with a leash you can use it to your advantage. Although you won't get an ABSOLUTE time (which is impossible due to initial assumptions), you'll be able to get an approximate time.
0	Here is a defense: this is a shit meme that is repeated every time r/atheism is brought up. "I'm an atheist but I'm not one if those atheists." When people post that what are they looking for? A pat on the back from Christians? A "good job, you are so tolerant for unsubscribing?" It's a way to have a superiority complex.   The other defense I have is: in my daily life I run across a lot of pro-Christian shit. From the Christmas music that is on repeat at work (the Jesus-y kind), to random "this is time for a prayer" situations, to random strangers telling me about their faith, to older relatives constantly sending me Jesus chain letters. In America, Christians have a lot of privilege. They get to flaunt their beliefs without most people second guessing it.   Now, I'm not an anti religious atheist. I'm not angry about the Christian shit I deal with. But when people start complaining that one subreddit on one website is "intolerant" or acting like "atheist assholes" you have to really look at the bigger context and ask yourself "is this really that big of a deal?" It's about a big of a deal as Grandma's chain letters.   Sorry for the rant... Uh
1	Enjoyed the TSM invitational immensly (enough to subscribe), due in no small part to the incredibly entertaining casting crew that kept it running so smoothly.  The ARAM's that filled the time between matches were often as entertaining and fun to watch (and listen to) as the matches themselves.  So I'm glad that you wrote a post here where I could conveniently express my thanks.   I understand that things are changing up a bit in S3, but I can only hope that there will be events where you and the rest of the invitational crew will be able to contribute to the game.   Without trying to feed the trolls, I don't understand why this thread is being downvoted at all.  If you didn't watch the invitational and don't know the casters, you can just leave this thread be, having a variety of announcers beyond Phreak, Deman, Joe "Joe Miller" Miller, Jatt, and Rivington should not be threatening.  These guys brought a style to the game that was unique and fun, whether or not you watch much of the NA scene.  I don't take a steaming pile on posts about Arenaea's recent casting or Fnatic roster change posts simply because I don't follow their scene and feel they don't deserve to clutter up my front page.
1	Ok are you guys actually serious in saying he talks too much?  People troll 10 times harder then this, and I think it's funny personally.  Ok yeah I get people who troll and suck, but this guy isn't a toxic player.  Since when was it smart or efficient to be anti-social in league?  Especially when /all chat is bumping with hilarious jokes.  The point of the game is to have fun, and if you lose focus because other people are typing in chat... bad player is bad.
1	False the first thing i did after seeing the login queue time was come to this site and look for other people having the same issue as well as try to gain knowledge on why the time was so long. Whole also learning that ranked queue is down after making it through the queue. ](
0	My first experiences of sleep paralysis  were  terrifying, but after I read up on the condition and understood it would eventually end, I started  looking forward  to the 30 seconds of helplessness. It had been years since I had an episode. 3/10 on the scary meter.   However, what  is  terrifying me these days are [hypnagogic hallucinations]( These sneaky buggers attack as you go to sleep.   Imagine drifting off to sleep, but your scumbag brain says "Nope, it's too quiet." Time for some ...     Loud demonic screaming and groaning - first few times 8/10 scary, but now only 3/10 scary.       Fingers touching all over your body - 11/10 on the scary meter, there is no getting used to this experience.  Every time it's my own private horror movie right inside my head.     Very cold - 2/10 on scary meter.       These only occur once every couple of months or so and thankfully, I can just wake up from these hallucinations.   However, just thinking about the invisible fingers touching/poking my back is now causing waves of terror to roll over my body raising all the hairs they encounter.
1	Ok, I might get downvoted for this, seeing as I posted earlier but it's so far down so it feels like it won't get noticed, apologies Aristite for using your comment to make it shown. But here it goes: First off, I have not played Jungle Shyvana s3 so I have nothing to add and/or complain about there, I will just have to take your word for it.   Secondly, I mildly disagree with you about the top lane weakness. After around 10 games (not a great number for empirical data, but bare with me please, I haven't played her since s2 until last week) against various champs, I have over 12 kills, less than 5 deaths and over 15 assists on a game average, haven't lost lane once. I do not intend to boast, just putting it out there for some data. Loads of times(not all) you can adapt to the lane by items, especially now with the new items, and don't hesitate to ask for an early gank if you feel that the enemy champion will counter you.   >W pushes the lane SUPER hard   3 things to take into account:     Wards wards wards. I cannot emphasize this enough, wards saves lives.   Whole point of W is just that, pushing. By putting pressure on their top laner, he must either sacrifice turret or ask for help (a lot like Singed's purpose). Once enemy toplaner get enough sustain, the lane will just become a  null state  which makes your worry fade.  *By pushing it up to their turret, you're free to either steal some jungle or gank mid by going through their jungle. By doing this enough times you're forcing them to either ward both tribush and river (if you're blue side), or they will be forced to act by going to golem (if you're purple side). That's not a lot I know, but every ward costs gold (unless jungler with Sightstone puts ward for the top laner). Just make sure you have escape options ready (such as Dragonform, 100 seconds ain't that long cd, especially when you can reduce it by fighting).     >No sustain, terrible ranged poke   Although this is true, hitting the E is a lot like Lee's Q, maybe not have smartcast toggled? (assuming you have it on) Anyway, she's a fighter, she's meant to be up their ass, fisting as much as possible with her Claw(too brute?). With her mixed set of damage she should be able to somewhat trade, if you can calculate when it is worth it or not, many people tend to ignore the fact that minions also hurt for quite much early stage. W can help with that as it also drops the minions around. But alas! You had a legit arguement for this as well!:   >and enemies can easily punish Shyvana by running away while W is on and then jumping on her as soon as it ends.   Simply put:  know your limits.  When it's around 2 seconds left of W, turn around from your "chase", you will be back behind your minions by this time so if they jump you, you should have some coverage by minions. If they run back everytime you run towards them and using W, they will lose gold from minions if you execute it well i.e. when they're going to your minions to get the cs, which either forces them to take a few blows or they fall back and lose the cs.   >Allow Shyvana's E to hit every unit in a straight line/a cone in  dragon form   Gonna assume you meant Human Form, as the dragon form already does it in a cone, which is the purpose of dragon form; to enhance the spell making it much more worth than being in human form.   Your third point about the impenetrable armor, I like it a lot.   How I start most of the times with her (toplane):  Masteries: 21/9/0 Runes: ArP reds, Armor yellows, mr/level blues, lifesteal quints. Items: x2 Rejuvenation beads, 1 pot, 1 ward (CANNOT afford to die early game with her, unless enemy laner does too). Items in general per game: Ravenous hydra(I actually rush this because it fits my playstyle to push then roam), boots varies depending on enemy team, Black Cleaver, Maw of malmortius/Wit's End, Trinity Force/Frozen mallet, Zephyr/Last Whisper/GA.  Note:  Yes, I do realize that I lack attack speed, I just value raw damage before quick hits, that way it doesn't matter if you can't catch up to people all the time in the chases, as long as you dish out more damage at once.   Item order:  x2 Rejuvenation beads -> Vamp scepter -> level 1 boots -> Ravenous Hydra/level 2 boots, depending on what you face top, sometimes you need that ninja tabi -> Boots lvl 2 or Hydra, depending what you built before -> hexdrinker if you lane vs magic, brutalizer if you're against another bruiser -> Hexdrinker/brutalizer -> Black Cleaver -> Phage -> Maw of Malmortius/sell Hexdrinker buy Wit's End -> Last Whisper/Zephyr/GA -> Trinity Force/Frozen Mallet.   Youmuu's Ghostblade can be bought instead of Black Cleaver, I just prefer the extra health but definitely Ghostblade is a valid item, seeing its activation provides attack speed and its passive gives +10 more ArP than BC. 20 less damage though, personal preference what to pick in my opinion.
1	While on paper what you say sounds okay, but Shyvana is such a niche champion that will get countered hard if she goes top lane. Champions like Jayce will shut her down by out trading/kiting her. Shyv's strong point is her high damage, AOE quick clears with burnout and the movement speed. You are able to bully most top laners in the early level but by the time they turn lvl 6, shyvana will began to fall off b.c. even though shyv has the ability to bully, she lacks the method to zone them or set up ganks.   also the part i want to really pick on is how u compared landing Shyvana's E with Lee Sin's Q. While the same can be said about any  skills that act as a linear missile, Lee Sin's Q i think has a bigger hit box due to the size of the orb and the animation adding 50units from its center (someone correct me if i'm wrong), making it much easier to hit. Even if u miss the enemy, u can use it as a gap closer if it hit a nearby enemy. And let's not forget the difference in damage out put.
1	People who get angry at their teammates for no identifiable, logical reason. I was playing recently as a top lane Zed against Vi and Kayle, eventually Vi left for bot and Darius left to follow them, of course, I lost my lane to Kayle because of her superior range and poke. I was going 3/0/3 at the time, not terrible, I reckoned, then our 0/8/1 Sejuani, who's been wandering into enemy territory all game and feeding, comments on how it's "2v1 top and lost your lane, patetic top" (written just like that too). Normally, I don't listen to flamers, but for some reason, this really annoyed me.
1	Not participating in team chat during champ select. Okay, so you're second pick and I'm #5. If you want top, just say so. Don't be a dick and insta lock whatever you want. Also be respectful to you possibly forcing someone in to a role they're really bad at. I mean we were all just chatting about roles for at least 30 seconds during bans.   I've had too many games where I asked for top, no response. Excellent, it's mine. Wait.. This guy just locked Darius. Jungle? But #4 asked for jungle. So... what's happening? We ask what role.   Pick#2> top   Me> But I called top   Pick#2> First pick, you can adc   Well, thanks you your inability to chat during all this, I'm now forced in to my possibly second to worst role, only behind AP mids. I can almost promise you we'll lose botunless our support is Xpecial caliber.
1	Being a top lane main and seeing other people on my team trying to top with ghost plus exhaust which ONLY/or never works with SPECIFIC champions (nobody used exhaust top because escaping from ganks with flash so you don't feed is more important and ignite is a must because even if your champ sucks in lane vs their's, you at least have a chance to kill them if they go full retard) and my ad carry bitch at me for teaching someone to play better. My top was obviously feeding for real while the enemy top was being the ultimate raid boss due to lane dominance in summoners.
1	I had a game where I was Ashe and playing a defensive lane because the enemy miss fortune killed me for first blood. Anyway I want to back, so I push the lane and go to bush to recall. I type in "shopping brb". After I get to the base the jungler comes into the bot river bush. He said nothing about coming bot, so I figure he just wants to wait till I get back. Nope he just jumps in after the enemy comes back to the lane. I fire my enchanted arrow towards the ruckus, because I'm way to far away to do anything else and I wanted to help. Our taric goes in and stuns the enemy soraka while the retreating miss fortune is being chased down by our jungler. The arrow comes and hits soraka (fuck yeah noscope) but taric doesn't have the damage to finish her. Our jungler takes 2 tower hits before coming back to try to secure soraka's kill, but the enemy shaco comes bot and helps soraka escape after soraka ults. Miss fortune comes back and taric and our yi get caught in her ultimate. By this time I'm back in the lane, but theres not much I can do. I shoot a volley of frost arrows towards them while my team runs away, but Miss fortune picks up a kill on our jungler. Yi rages and says that I wasn't there for the gank. Swears that I fed miss fortune because she got first blood, and he swears at me for not being in the fight, and tells everyone on the team that he will never gank bot again.
1	1) My biggest pet peeve HAS to be when someone does terrible (enemy or ally) and they blame their team. examples: "Maybe if [jungler] ganked more, id do better"  "Gg bot fed thats why i went 0/10" "Support didnt shield me wtf"   I mean, take responsibility for yourself. It's no ones job to baby sit you, don't play game if you can't lane without being babysat. I pretty much only go mid lane, and I usually do really well without junglers help, so when enemy mid laner blames their jungler for why they did bad themselves, it pisses me off.   2) I also hate assholes on that game in general. Work with your team, dont insult them and throw the game because they gave a few kills.   and 3) when you CALL A ROLE IN TEAM SELECT AND SOMEONE INSTALOCKS IT ANYWAY AND SAYS "TOO BAD"
1	Scarra played like shit in a game with TheRainMan and scapegoated TRMs nonstandard build.
1	They implemented it a while ago but the forum was basicly flooded with threads to bring it back. So I'm afraid it won't happen.
1	so telling the truth is "witch hunting"?  and stating your very own opinion is "pitchforking"?   i don't think so.  imho this subreddit should follow the rules of democracy.  two very important characteristics of modern democracies are "freedom of speech" and "freedom of opinion".   by removing a legit post like destiny's (which just states facts), you clearly violate the rules of democracy. you violate such important rights like "freedom of speech" and "freedom of opinion".  it seems like this subreddit's mods do like to create their own "reality". by removing posts like destiny's you are clearly trying to control and manipulate the collective opinion of this subreddit's community.  this is a very dangerous thing you do here - and i can't believe you also try to justify what you did.   it seems like this subreddit's mods rather like to lead it like an aristocracy than like a democracy - with the mods themselves being the aristocrats who decide which opinion is legit for the community.  and if they decide that someone's opinion or post about a real experience is not legit, they are just gonna remove it.   "who controls the past, controls the future. who controls the present, controls the past......"
1	Here's an idea. How about we stop having a subreddit controlled by the mods, but by users. The users are the ones that post the content that is relevant to the subreddit. This is totally relevant to League of Legends. League of Legends is the most popular streamed game EVER.   Now that there are only 2 platforms upon which a new player can stream on, Destiny's article provides a very real world example. Not only the users streaming themselves but supporting their favourite streamers, how do they know that the subscription money they're giving is actually going to the streamer?
1	Can't we just get rid of these mods and get some new one's in make a rule that we are allowed to talk about stuff and never look back?!
1	Gonna have to very much agree with Destiny on this one. He didn't ask for anyone to do anything towards Own3d.tv in his thread. All he did was post a cited page detailing how he wasn't paid for the work he did while in service of the streaming provider.   The fact that "Witch hunting" and "pitchforks" appeared in the thread is a result of other people, not Destiny himself. The correct response for the mods would be to actively watch the post, and delete anything that would be taken as "Witch hunting" (If you really want to delete anything at all).   I understand the desire to keep people from being doxxd, but this is a case where Destiny wasn't paid for months of work by a well-known streaming service, and he wanted all of /r/League to know about it. I imagine his motives were as simple as "Look at how awful these guys are screwing us!"   The people at own3d.tv are going to be harassed, one way or another. Probably more-so with the removal of Destiny's post, because now everyone who has been riled up has a reason to think that the Moderator's are defending own3d. If the fire gets bigger than it was before, it's on your heads.   In conclusion, i sincerely believe the mods made the wrong choice here. Not only does the /r/League community now have a "witch hunt" for own3d.tv, a few bad apples now have one for the Moderators of this subreddit. It wasn't a tactful move to broad-stroke the delete brush on the entire thread, because now its another problem completely.
1	This is not setting a precedent to perform a witch hunt. This was a post to warn people about own3d. Both future streamers and viewers. Future streamers would like to be payed as well. And their lives, like Destiny's, depend on it. If a company is knowingly destroying people's lives, by not paying money that they own them, they deserve to get a public warning against them. Even more so, as a viewer I'll pay money and subscribe to a person's stream to support the streamer. I don't do that because I support own3d.   This means it's not solely in Destiny's interest to warn people about own3d. It's the entire community's interest. This means it's not a witch hunt. Destiny also provided sufficient data and evidence to back up his claims (skype logs, contract quotes etc). Can this evidence be falsified? Yes. But if so, it would only take 1 post from ow3d with their logs to undermine it. Own3d can provide a statement as well, just as much as Destiny can.   It doesn't matter whether this sets a precedent if it's something that's in the best interest of the community to know. It would be a witch hunt if Destiny posted this to pursue his own goals and his goal was to pressure them into doing something. It's not. It's about warning future streamers and viewers to be very careful with own3d. Destiny is trying to look out for the community, not for himself. therefor this should be widely known. Reddit is one of the ways to warn a giant portion of this community. It's not like Destiny is the first one warning about own3d. This stuff has been going on for quite a while now. It's been out there before, yet still nothing has changed.   This means it's fine if this sets a precedent. Because it's our interest at stake here. It's not like own3d can't defend themselves. They can. and the fact that they don't, says a lot.
1	Let's start a witch hunt against triggs390 he's obviously being paid off by own3d.tv   The destiny thing is obviously not a witch hunt also with other streamers like dyrus, husky, and other prolific streamers confirming that this happens. It's a call to action to help stop this since the streamers themselves can't do anything since they don't have the money to take them to court. We need justice.
1	This subreddit has the worst moderation a subreddit can really have. Its not a new trend that the subreddit mods are completely isolated from the community. Occasionally it will get attention with the destiny post and when clakeydeeeeeeeeeee's AMA + stream promotion thread was removed with 1.2k upvotes...   But it just gets really frusturating that the moderators see this as THEIR community. Thats really the problem. Good moderators see their subreddit or community as someone elses community, and their job isn't to make the community what they want, but to allow the community to make itself (IE: with reddit we have the upvote and downvote buttons which determines generally speaking the content we like and don't like).   Occasionally if something gets out of hand and someone makes a thread about it, then maybe they can rule on that. Like back several months ago there was a comic contest that resulted in like 10/25 posts on the frontpage being comic contest fan art and stuff. But whether or not thats allowed, there were also complaint threads about it, which informed the moderators that maybe they should make some sort of rule or decision regarding that. But on these matters they start to make unilateral decisions based on solely their own opinions, and actually against the community will at the time.   If ClakeyDeeeeee makes an ama then his friend asks people to upvote it on his stream. You should probably not delete the ama unless someone posts a thread that gets attention calling him out for upvoting it. Thats how a reddit community can shape itself. Not by an oligarchy of mods who decide what is and isn't ok, but by community members who can join together and make mods aware of issues.   In this case the moderators decided that this was a "witch hunt" and based on the community reaction with this thread and the other thread re: "can I make a post saying "destiny" without it being removed?" thread. The moderators are DEAD wrong about what the community considers to be witch hunting. Whether they still believe that they are correct in saying its a witch hunt or not, the community disagrees. Whether or not they care now... thats the issue.   In my opinion they should care what we think. But they don't.   I know the community has gotten huge and hard to handle, but I honestly believe that the worst aspects of this community is the over-moderation.   I started to not really like this subreddit when it really did start turning into General Discussion. Its decisions like this that the moderators make that are ultimatly doing that.
1	Hey guys, there's this company that says they sell cereal. Well I've bought 10 boxes over the course of 6 months and they never had any cereal in them, just full of roaches. Be careful, do NOT get scammed by these people!"   You: "Lol fuck u where not gonna try and take them down for you im from forechun heheheheh not your personal army and
1	Take a moment and think where all this leads, there are more then a few comments out there that are PURE threats. We see them and delete them, while you guys hopefully sees less of them.   However this whole story has lead to some crazy shit just because we stand by our rule, does this mean we should change the rule, no, to me this just shows exactly WHY we have this rule, there has been death-threats aimed towards us in mod-mail and there are pitchforked raised out here in the community.   >The problem with above example is that the bully is /was vastly unknown and anonymous' named someone (assuming, with some evidence) in part of legal proceedings /news of the case. What we have here, is essentially the bully in broad daylight   The problem is the fact that even if the "bully" is known, people still tend to take rash decisions and I wouldn't think that one person alone is responsible for this mess, and even if there are evidence, we wont support the internet rage to spew up and end up in death-threats.   We have many reasonable members that can discuss and debate but there are always others lurking in the shadows. For YOU it might be a huge step to take from being angry to actually threaten people and then to actually DO something, for others the steps might not be that big. After all we are all humans and we act and behave diffrently.   >It is witch hunting to say "hey, these guys are assholes, let find where they live and burn his house down" which is totally out of context of "hey guys, own3d have been screwing me over, please dont fall to the same mistakes i made"   I agree on you there to some extent, you see, the comments escalated quite quickly and the main reason that the original thread got taken down wasn't based on the witch hunt part, it was based on personal information. Then when that was deleted it went totally mayhem, witch hunts for own3d and for us mods started to appear and the pitchforks turned to us.   Another thread to keep in mind when all this comes up:
1	if in a draft situation: (such as ranked) try to pick your adc later/last and if you see olaf, pick a champion with a solid escape/gap closer (Tristana, cait, ezreal, vayne) and consider playing a champ with hard peel (such as alistar with his knockback) while you don't get a stun you can still make him back off for awhile. then of course their is flash.   In a blind pick situation: Always prepare for olaf in some capacity. Make sure your adc isn't being forced into the role because nobody else likes it (this can be hard/impossible sometimes unfortunately) and make sure you are playing a support who has some form of hard peel (i'm not sure if olaf's ulti prevents him from being knocked up or not as i don't play him, so janna might work) and pack exhaust, because that 30% damage reduction should be applied to his true damage (unless it's bugged).   Ultimately, the best way to protect your adc is to make sure that you and your adc play smart in teamfights/lane, and if olaf is top, hope he loses lane.   If all else fails, flash   Counter play: (depending on olaf's place on the team, results may vary) a big problem with the adc diving olaf is it leaves the enemy team without a top lane tank (or jungle tank) to protect their adc (he's to busy diving yours), forcing their support/jungler/top laner to build tanky (or possible their mid). meaning their only form of big damage outside olaf is their adc/mid/top lane. If you have a bursty mid or jungler on your team you may be able to snipe their adc/mid and stop a lot of their damage in teamfights.
1	Also, as a support there isn't much you can personally do as an individual to stop an Olaf other than trying to grab his attention and direct him towards you as a freebie to pick up, allowing time for your team to take a 4v4 against theirs without their major anti-carry involved. If they don't even want to fight, it still gives them room to try to recover and defend under a turret with his ult down.
0	Haha omg I can't believe that was real, I was expecting a gif. I'm at work. They block /r/WTF here but not /r/gonewild.
1	Statistically speaking, the word "Report" is among the most commonly used by toxic players.   However, it's used almost as frequently by non-toxic players in games alongside a toxic player.   It is not reportable to ask for others to report people who you believe are acting in a toxic manner.  It never should be, since the system heavily favors those who have multiple reports per game, and if you only troll 1 person per game once every so often, you get off scott free if no one else reports.   But harassing a player for poor play is always reportable.  And if the manner by which you choose to do so is to ask people to report them, then you should be banned.   Does that make sense?   As a better example, in a game yesterday, I said 3 separate times in chat to report my support.  The first time was when he refused to quit attacking creeps after being asked to (He was gold-Elo season 2.  He knew better and was doing it to troll me.  Since he was playing Thresh his q passive made it impossible for me to last-hit over him in lane).  The second time was at the end of the game when people were saying gg, I said "gg, Please report Thresh".  The third time was in the end-game screen.  My actions were not reportable.  His were.  That's about where the line occurs.  If I had asked to report him for the 3 times we lost trades because he had no clue what he was doing on Thresh, however, it would've been reportable.
1	I am a jack of all trades type summoner. I'm at 41/110 win with a different champ at 90 wins. However, I agree more on your point than your friend's point. I have a friend who is a beast Akali, he has studied her and played her for two years now. I rarely see him lose a lane and lose a game on her. He is just that good on her. While he a beast on her, because of the dedication, his play on other champs can usually be subpar. His mindset in League now, is that of an Akali player and only that.   So while I feel having your main champ is extremely important (I'm starting to get that way with Zed now). It is always great to have a good pool on the back burner, for situational times. I feel I can play a game and win my lane with probably about 1/3 of the champs in the game, leaving me room to counter.
0	to date there has been no proven marker, physiological, or anatomical correlation to being gay.  but they brain is a fickle thing.  there is not gene for liking dogs over cats or similar personality traits.  i took many neuro biology classes, one of which titled nature vs nurture, one of the things we discuses was being guy, the conclusion... we have no idea why people are guy/bi, but its likely a combination of many things, like why you love popcorn but your SO needs rasinets when you see a movie.  what you might be thinking of are some studies on trans people, they are theories (no actual proof again) that say that possibly curtain sex hormones stop being produced, or the receptors for them stop recognizing it, and the result is different gender make up between body and brain...   if this was all she had said “Homosexual students come to me with their problems, and I don’t agree with them, but I care about them. It’s the same thing with my special needs kids, I think God puts everyone in our lives for a reason.” i might see you point,   its this part i hate: When asked if LGBT people have a purpose in life, Medley responds, “No I honestly don’t. Sorry, but I don’t. I don’t understand it. A gay person isn’t going to come up and make some change unless it’s to realize that it was a choice and they’re choosing God.”   Read more at
0	As much as I wish this weren't true, I have an example.   My buddy Alex claimed to be "bi" around several smokin hot girls in the 10th grade. Well about a month later all of his other friends were avoiding him and just started referring to him as "bi-guy" (which has a nice ring) but there were some violent threats towards him too. Well, to end, he's not bi he's just a man-whore who saw an in and didn't think about what he was doing.
0	it's not really an emotional issue. You're just lacking evidence. A goal of mating might be to procreate under some circumstances but saying that it's the only goal is a qualitative assumption disregarding a lot of easy counterpoints.   Obviously mating requires a lot of energy investment, so why would we see it across the population in infertile, post-menopausal women as well as during fertile women during periods of estrus when they are completely unlikely to conceive.   It's worth noting that humans are among the most sexually active of mammals and simultaneously one of the least fertile. If the goal of mating was to procreate, this would give us the lowest return on that energy investment (a smarter mating strategy, if procreation were the only goal, would be to only mate when conditions are most favorable to conception and during times when there is enough resources to support offspring)   It's worth noting that both of those are  DERIVED  traits meaning that they  must  have a advantage in fitness for humans over conserved traits (mating only during "heat").   So essentially, claiming that the mating mechanism is defective without a clear understanding of what mating, in humans, is designed to accomplish is clear misstep.
1	I would have voted ban on him as well. Irregardless of what was said to him in any situation, it doesn't give him the right to troll or counter-troll and be an asshat. Even if you're being antagonized, you need to be an adult and just ignore that person rather than spamming: "LOL EXPLODED WITH ANGER BRO, STFU" like a child.
1	As a support who usually ends up shouldering the responsibility for warding the entire map, I second this not so much as a shaming tool, but just to keep track of utility. I like to evaluate my play after games and since warding is one of my primary responsibilities, it would be helpful to see this especially comparing it to the enemy jungler or support. "Wow, that enemy Taric had twice as many wards as I did! No wonder they seemed to gank us everywhere."   As a suggestion, perhaps show this at the end of the game where the other stats are normally posted. That way you can cut down on in-game flaming (though it's pretty obvious in-game when you don't ward).   As an example, I like how Elobuff records wards placed and includes a difference for sightwards and regular wards. I think Wards bought isn't that informative. I've had a few games with a support will buy a ward and it will sit in their inventory the whole game. If it isn't placed, it isn't useful.   Number of wards destroyed would also be great. Let you know just how awesome that oracle's was and that the gold spent was worth.   As for those concerned about spamming wards...well, I don't see how that is an issue. You can inflate any other stat score the same way. If someone is ward spamming by fountain, that is a troll issue like someone who insists on inappropriately creep farming while everyone else is involved in teamfighting. Having the highest ward count also shouldn't be something people should be seriously competing for. Quality placement, not quantity placement.
1	Overral a team's strategy can stay the same though if the same player is willing to work harder at the game to become more mechanically skilled and aware of the position they're in as a result of lol patches. Building a team around doublelift is still hugely viable because of his mechanical skill and capability as an adc. I think it's not as much a question of a player's role but really how they fit into a team and the role they play. CLG has played with the same basic foundation of protecting doublelift so he can carry and building other strats around it to maximise his carry potential.   I mean sure you can change your strategy to suit the lol patch, but you can't trade player personality/playstyle just because of a lol patch and expect to be able to win straight away. The problem is that as soon as the patch favors a certain meta, it can just as quickly change again and the teams that survive are the ones who have developed strategies and team comps that they know they can play regardless of the changes and incorporate the changes to suit them but not rely on them as a central point in their strategy. This is how teams like Curse and CLG win - they stick to what they know can win them the game and utilise advantages from the patches to leverage this.   You don't have to switch the focus of the team strategy which you trust and know just because of a patch, playing with what's comfortable and developing a way to complement it is much more advantageous than changing your game plan.   For example EG vs SK in Week 1, EG rolled out a new strategy which didn't fit into their playstyles and this allowed SK to take advantages snowballing to a victory. This was implemented with Olaf utilising health as a core strategy to win. Kev1n played more or less the same as he always did, but utilised the patch to give him the advantage.
1	I never really j understood why one champ can be "OP" on week and then a month later after one small change to their scaling or whatever. They are suddenly not viable and shit. Seriously? Who makes the descion on if they are still viable or not? Have you even tried the champion post nerf or are you just going with the crowd? I personally have never really listened to the "champion viable/not viable" meta. That may be why I was never good in ranked. But I have to say when caitlyn was nerfed last year and was considered not very good. I still played her and never missed a beat. I didn't even notice she got nerfed until my friend tried to tell me she was shit at the time.
1	shes an AD Caster she uses abilities to do serious damage, so you stack damage and armour pen (BC LW BT) and then take defensive items (Warmogs + Randuins/GA/whatever).   I feel as if what you're saying here is proving DL's point. He is saying that ADCs will no longer exist as they are now. If ADCs become AD Casters/Tanky-DPS champions rather than the glass-cannon champions they are now, ADCs will no longer be played. Draven excels are snowballing the game early, and while his damage does scale very well nito late-game, why play him over Kog'maw, who has superior range and % HP damage. Why play Ashe when you can just play a Graves and pick another champion with strong iniation. In ou For pro players, there is very little incentive to actually innovate. Why would they take risks when they can just play what works. As a theorycrafter, you need to play what you think will work well. Being a theorycrafter is a thankless job, no one is going to pat you on the back when everyone else is doing what you were doing 6 months ago. However, those people are the innovators, they keep the game fresh and constantly change the meta.
1	I believe what Doublelift is saying is that in a vacuum, a lot of ad carries are bad because they do not have escapes. Champs like draven/varus/ashe are only good when you have to team for them. If you don't have a team built around them, they really do suck, because champs like olaf, renekton, j4, akali, hec all have ways of easily killing them because they don't have escapes. CLG needs doublelift to carry them and it is really hard to win with those champs if their whole team is gunning for you. Sure you can build warmog/randuins, but that means you sacrifice a whole ton of damage to build those items. If enemy team has a carry that didn't build 2 defensive item but 1 defensive and one offensive, that ad carry is going to have a lot more damage output over a course of team fight and eventually you are going to lose because sure you beat their olaf one on one but their adc, with help of his team peeling for him, just killed 4 of your team. What do next? Building two defensive item only works when you have other people acting as the carry role such as rapidstar in frost, maknoon in sword, regi in tsm, or froggen in eg.
1	The reason doublelift said draven was shit is because of his lack of escape. With all of the brusiers with gap closers coming into play Draven is going to be a very unsafe pick. Draven is used to bully your lane due to his dmg he can acheive early. But if you get a Jarvan or Xin or Vi the top 3 junglers in the NA scene right now you have to blow flash to escape them which will leave you open to ganks while that is on cd. You saw in the CLG game yesterday against Twitch Hotshot just jumped on him as malphite every time and rendered him almost usless. That is why he says they are shit.
0	No, I litteraly can not, I've tried, but the space between my tieth is so non-existent that when i try, i just saw the flossing wire thingie in two, but no need to worry, i have things to replace the flossing, small thingies to clean the gum between teeth.
1	IIRC there were only 3 matches that crashed. WE was ahead in the initial Game 2 (which is why many say WE should've been the rightful winner because they could've won the Bo3 right there). Then in the initial Game 3 CLG was about to win when it crashed (no doubt there, the nexus was basically open to them). In the remake of Game 3 that crashed at around 20mins no one had a clear lead imo, it could've gone both ways.   So even if you split up the games in 3 Bo3 and count all games in favor of the team that had the lead during the game, it would've been:   WE - CLG.EU: 2-0 (Game 1 + Aborted Game 2)   WE - CLG.EU: 0-2 (Remake Game 2 + Aborted Game 3)   WE - CLG.EU: 1-2 (Postponed Bo3)   I didn't count the last of remake of Game 3, because a) no clear lead and b) it doesn't fit into the other Bo3's.   So
0	I don't understand. Most computer programming languages that existed 20 years ago are completely invalid now. Considering Moore's law, the languages in use in the next 20 years will be completely different then the ones we use now.
1	Just play it like its a normal game. Remember it just for fun AND you can just delete your old team with a shitty record and make a new one.   And laugh. I can't say how important it is to laugh. When something shitty happens, and a close friend blames you, just say a witty retort (Eat a dick!) and laugh. Laughing relieves the tension in a game quickly. And don't make your force your friends into champs they don't want to play. Hell our ranked team has a 100% win rate with support Nasus and mid Karma because they felt like playing those champs.
0	You're the one who's clearly quite confused, dear. You see, I spoke first saying I would not respond. That was my last communication, until I told you the second correction, and added "I said I would not respond to you again" and you said I had lied once. I hadn't responded to you between then, nor had I said I wouldn't respond to you before that.
1	so, what's happening here is part of the system. You're not supposed to be able to be diamond while also having your hidden ELO (MMR) be around 1100. The system gives you less points - ESPECIALLY towards a league change, rather then just moving up a division - if it thinks you don't belong there. So you have to keep winning games in a row until your hidden ELO catches up to your displayed rating. When it does, your LP gains will go up/back to normal! I was in gold 5 at the beginning of the season and lost a lot without dropping(because you cant drop a league down) and when i tried to climb to gold 4 it took muchhh longer and I was getting 16 for a win and 20 for a loss!
0	Comment from roommate:  "I don't believe it. It has only been a week-- I would believe that level of craziness if it were a longer relationship, and if he were going to study abroad and she took a mold of his penis. This just doesn't seem realistic."
1	Im from Gold 2 on my main but I honestly think I could easily be in Plat but I just don't play on it alot. I smurf in lower ELO constantly and to be honest losses are very rare if you know what you are doing and how to play at low ELO. On one of my accounts, I dodged promotion series constantly on my low elo account just for fun because every game seems to be a stomp.
1	When you don't reach this amount of placed wards in a game of a normal length, it says more about you than about the item.   I liked that part :) Otherwise yeah, I get your point. Otherwise you may wanna add a
1	Dude... seriously? Meet OPZan, he just got into a game, with 4 premades in his team. Sadly enough, he accidentally fed the laning opponent, let's call him xPeke, xPeke however, thinks OPZan did a great job in lane, and did everything he could, while all OPZan's team can see is his score. Guess who's having 4 bad reviews?
1	So if you're aware of missing CS, don't you think that we supports would be more aware that we don't have enough wards out? We know how to do our jobs, just as an ADC knows how to do theirs.   The reason we get so touchy about it is because sometimes we get more shit than junglers do when they can't gank a lane. Only we get it when we take CS when the ADC isn't even there, when our wards get destroyed, when we get killed in a teamfight while helping the ADC live, when initiating what would have been a good fight if the team had just gone in, when we can't afford an oracle's, when we wander to help other lanes that need it more or basically any other bullshit reason to vent on the one person that's labeled as the "team bitch".   We are supports. We support you. We help you get to the point where YOU can carry the rest of us. What are you without us? If you take supports for granted or harp on them too much, they will leave you. There are times where the random ADC I was paired with doesn't listen to my warnings/pings and then rages in all caps about how I didn't  say anything when I clearly did. There are times where I've put up with this, other times I simply wandered to top lane instead to take that tower. To be honest, I don't believe I have to stick with the ADC all game long. I don't believe that I have to hold bot lane's hand because most times they know what they're doing or how they need to play. That means them free-farming at tower for a minute while I go get mid a few kills on occassion.   Furthermore, the people that main support won't normally comment on your ability as an ADC, since it's most likely that they were once an ADC main as well. Shitty supports are the reason I main support now. If you miss a minion, we won't comment on it because we know that you know you missed it. Bringing it to attention will just make you angry, and thus less willing to cooperate with us when it comes time to fight. Harshing your mellow is just something I'd rather not do if it means that it'll put you off your game.
1	Yes, when every lane loses from minute one. All lanes warded and it's all the jungler's fault. Because he didn't try to gank your lane 4 times. He didn't try to help you. But you picked lanes that don't support ganks well but are easily gankable when lacking wards. He warded approaches but when he drops 500 gold to ward for every lane you blame him for not being tanky enough. I am so tired of the blame game. I don't even care about losing anymore I just dont want to be blamed relentlessly throughout the game and then have people spamming me friend invites so they can hate more.
1	So if you're aware of missing CS, don't you think that we supports would be more aware that we don't have enough wards out? We know how to do our jobs, just as an ADC knows how to do theirs."   Because often you aren't. If I'm an ADC and I know I'm missing CS, that's because there's something right in front of me I'm failing at and can immediately address and fix without the support telling me about it; if it continues, then it can be pointed out and is problem a deficiency of the player. Similar the other way around.   "The reason we get so touchy about it is because sometimes we get more shit than junglers do when they can't gank a lane. Only we get it when we take CS when the ADC isn't even there, when our wards get destroyed, when we get killed in a teamfight while helping the ADC live, when initiating what would have been a good fight if the team had just gone in, when we can't afford an oracle's, when we wander to help other lanes that need it more or basically any other bullshit reason to vent on the one person that's labeled as the "team bitch"."   I hate to be "that guy", but you're what? Silver? Bronze? I almost never hear anything but legitimate problems with a support above silver, and rarely ever in silver when I was in it.   "We are supports. We support you. We help you get to the point where YOU can carry the rest of us. What are you without us? If you take supports for granted or harp on them too much, they will leave you. There are times where the random ADC I was paired with doesn't listen to my warnings/pings and then rages in all caps about how I didn't say anything when I clearly did. "   We are carries. We carry you. You get us to the point we can, and then we take over. What are you without us? If you take ADCs for granted or harp on them too much, they will leave you. There are times where a random support I was paired with doesn't listen to my engage pings and I end up dying because he didn't know how to use his skills, and then he rages in all caps about how bad his ADC is.   "There are times where I've put up with this, other times I simply wandered to top lane instead to take that tower. To be honest, I don't believe I have to stick with the ADC all game long. I don't believe that I have to hold bot lane's hand because most times they know what they're doing or how they need to play. That means them free-farming at tower for a minute while I go get mid a few kills on occassion."   Holy shit, roaming. Fucking blowing my mind here, bro.   "Furthermore, the people that main support won't normally comment on your ability as an ADC, since it's most likely that they were once an ADC main as well. Shitty supports are the reason I main support now. If you miss a minion, we won't comment on it because we know that you know you missed it. Bringing it to attention will just make you angry, and thus less willing to cooperate with us when it comes time to fight. Harshing your mellow is just something I'd rather not do if it means that it'll put you off your game."   I wouldn't agree with this.
1	I actually think that Support get congratulated more than ADCs. In fact after gank stage the only thing that will get a jungler congratulated is a smite steal. Top Lane and Mid only get a mention when they are snowballed as fuck, whereas if a support player is playing well everyone treats them like a girl they like. Its like every support player is an ADC's girlfriend and thats why they are playing, and everyone is SUPER nice to them on the offchance of a blowjob.
1	ADC main here. This is all well and good and I know I would be nothing without my support, but can I just say something? If I buy a ward because I feel you're not warding enough or that you have yet to buy a pink to clear out enemy wards, don't take it the wrong way. I am trying to help you help me. Every game where I have bought wards as an ADC, my supports have raged at me. Sorry for helping you out.
1	There is a counter to this. It is the best feeling in the game when you are adc or support and you get along with your counter part. I was an ADC for a guy who only had yordels and similar type charactes including nunu. He couldn't play very well at all but he was NUNU support and I told him what I needed and he did it. We ended up winning three out of four games and the game we lost was one that we weren't bot lane in. He learned a lot from me and I learned from him by giving him pointers and watching him execute.   The point is listen to each other. Maybe your support may not be aware of the entire map but if he says stay back just do it. If your ADC wants you to engage try it with a sure escape route first as to not get killed in the process.   If you work together you can blame the loss of the lane on eachother, take ownership, and get better. If you play as complete individuals you will lose collectively on most occasions. I constantly say GJ when it is warranted and give feedback for my playstyle when there needs to be improvement. I discuss my playstyle before the game starts when I'm ADC and ask theirs when I'm support. It makes for a better time.   The other side is I was playing Graves ADC with a Voli support and Voli was way too aggressive. He was completely out of reach from me when he engaged and on the otherside of the minion wave by minute 3. I asked him to be a bit more selective and have some bush control as he stayed in the middle of lane, he told me to go screw my self. We fed the other team's bot lane pretty bad I was low on damage but I started building back up. By late game I got pretty competitive as far as damage output compared to how it started, but Voli kept baiting us into bad fights and overpursuing, taking himself out of the equation and the rest of the team hadn't done too hot either.  The point is it doesn't always pan out. I had a bad game but the rest of the team didn't rage and it was still fun. They realized that voli wasn't playing right and i wasn't all to blame. They said I sucked at first but came around toward the end.
1	I agree with this and I've come to notice that instead of the support being blamed for mistakes on bottom lane like OP said, the ADC gets blamed most of the times.   Had a game with me being MF and having a support Lux at bot. All went fairly well at the beginning, Lux set up some pretty good snares and we were able to kill the enemy bot lane a few times. After about 10 minutes in, Lux decided she wanted to turret dive the enemies, so she pinged for me to go in.   I looked at the big picture, our wards had just run out, enemy mid (nidalee) and top (jax with tp) were MIA and I didn't feel save enough to make a turret dive under such circumstances. I pinged Lux back, told her "don't dive" but she didn't listen and went for the enemies. I stood back and waited for the inevitable: Jax tp-ed in, a spear flew in Lux' face and she died. After that a flaming tirade errupted from her "OMG MF stop sleeping, coulda killed them there. U suck!!111!"   After this, every time Lux overextended with no vision she blamed me and later the whole team for not following up. She stopped warding because "noob team, can't carry this shit" and pretty much ruined the whole gaming experience for us others.
1	Yes, the support gets the shaft on things. Let's now look at the jungler. We are expected to keep up in levels and gold, gank the lanes, ward, secure objectives and die for the greater good of the team. We have to not only compete with the enemy jungler stealing our jungle but our own team. I love being the jungler and the mid going to take my wraiths before 6-7 minutes. Then I go in and gank, red buff might take the kill and then I get yelled at for stealing it. Then the lanes are pushed to tower and warded, so I am unable to gank. My lanes are taking the jungle farm and I can't gank anything.
1	As a main adc (but i support sometimes) I would say that often I believe supports are the ones who get recognition and the least blame when the game is going bad.  I rarely get mad at my support and it is only when supports are playing really bad by not warding or just positioning really really bad.   Most of the time though when team fights go wrong ADCs and AP mids are blamed. supports often ask- why you focusing tanks?? or why were you farming and not in teamfights? ADCs rarely get the benefit of the doubt when it seems they were focusing the rong people. Whenever they lose out in the laning phase its, GG WP ADC sucks. Really rarely do i get a support who gives me the benefit of the doubt. What supports do things like criticise their adc it just makes them play worst.
1	YES TO THE MAX!   I play a lot of support, and ADCs are generally bad... I'm sorry, but I know my mechanics are better than most people I support lol.  Then they bitch at me for taking a last hit they missed.   Even after I got them FB/double kill, even after they are up 20CS by 5 min.   Even after I kept bot lane lit up like a Christmas tree with wards.   But I am bad, because I took one creep.
1	I agree with you man. I used to main ADC, but too many times the support wouldn't really know what to do but take cs. I once played with a Nidalee who called "supp" in Lobby. Then proceeded to take cs from me while I was in lane. I'm fine if you take cs when I'm out of lane, but while I'm in lane I'd much rather you be harassing the enemy, warding or zoning the other carry.   Also ADC's really can't make plays because they don't have much cc, or utility. The support or jungler comes in set's up the kill and the ADC does damage and picks it up. Bot lane ADC's are nothing without a support.   BUT not all ADC's are bad. I once played with an ADC who: 1) Gave me a kill or two mid game so I could get that Iron Locket and Runic. 2) Bought a few wards throughout the game. 3) Apologized to me when we both died because I missed my crescendo (I was so embarrassed QQ) and told me "It happens. Don't worry" 4) Defended me when the rest of the team was typing stuff like "Sona noob... 2/8" "LOL sona feeder report pls 2/8" and explained to them what a support's role is.
1	As a support and ADC main, I feel the harsh bullcrap that supports go through and that ADCs inflict on my supports, giving me an epiphany in terms of how to act when playing.
1	I baby say mid and top(bottom was wrecking shit so no need to go down bit), both lanes ended up losing. How? Because bot got a double we went to drag, next thing I know mid and top both dead..... We took drag and then bot and I pushed mid, backed off because we had wards and saw a 3v5 coming our way.  Top and mid just then got to mid lane and went in 2v5 under there tower, after we explicitly said "do not engage them" "double kill" for enemy ez.  At this point I had to B no health. and bot tried to hold turret 2v5, taric died(miscommunication, I pinged back off the tower missed and pinged there ez he went in draven ran) and draven got away, they took mid tower.  We were 4v5 under our mid inner tower, they engaged, we won team fight got ez and Ali. Rest had to run. We pushed mid out, Elise went back top, got caught out under there tower trying to "split push" they took too before we could get there(we had just taken mid) Ez was at that point I believe 6/4/3, and went from 30 cs behind to 10cs ahead. They refused to team fight kept getting caught out. I was mad.  Lost my promo.  I know I made mistakes that game and I know it's not completely my teammates loss, looking back the replay I found mistakes I could have avoided, 1 death I could have avoided, 2 missed kills, 1 dragon chance, and 2 chances to steal enemy buffs, and 1 chance to hank hot and help them steamroll farther.  Maybe if I had done those things we could have won. I'll never know, but I shouldn't have to play that flawless in order to win a team game. I feel my teammates should pick up my slack as I pick up there's.   Sometimes it's hard not to blame your teammates, as sometimes I believe it is there fault, there are plenty of game I lost for my team, plenty that I've been carries to a win, and plenty that I've carried. Sometimes it is your team and it always sucks knowing that you never had a chance that game. :(
1	If I buy a ward because I feel you're not warding enough   ..   >
1	That's what I have problems with. Because not only are you being disrespectful to the troll, you are doing so to your teammates as well. A simple "please report x for trolling" in all chat would suffice.   Unfortunately trolls start problems by being rude. Then more people join in, because somehow telling the troll they are an asshole is going to make things better. Why do you have to express your opinion about their behavior. If they are having a bad game, you're being the troll and jumping down somebody's throat for something they fully know is going on and are trying to fix, usually pushing them even further on tilt. If they are trolling, they are doing what they do specifically to get the reaction you are giving.
0	Calling OP's statement 'not funny' isn't a fact, it's opinion.   And as a white, heterosexual English-speaking male (the people feminists are trying to gain equal treatment from) - the angrier you get, the less we're inclined to give you what you want.   Because we're the ones with the power, the higher wages, and we're the ones that do the oppressing. To get rid of that oppressing you have to make a reasonable case and appeal to our sense of fairness. Getting angry just makes you easier to write off as a lesbian, a feminazi, a misandrist, a bra-burner, all that radical flung-out scary stuff. As soon as that happens - BAM - ignored.   If you sat down, talked calmly, discussed options and made reasonable arguments, you would get results quicker.   And don't say 'how dare you deign to tell us that the power is YOURS to give, it should belong to everyone' - because there's no such thing as 'should' in a matter like this. There's no higher authority to appeal to, there's just the most powerful group. And that's my demographic.
0	Storytime- I went to a LARP event recently, where I dressed up as an orc and hit people with foam swords. It was -10 and I'd been camping, so I'd been sleeping in my thermals but not my bra. I'm not a morning person, and it turns out that 3 layers of thermal vests is quite supportive. I only realised I was bra-less when I was being fitted for my breastplate.
0	psych major here, so allow me to just say this. when women say things, they are often misinterpreted by the opposite gender. Same goes for women when men say things. It's more frequent than you'd think, hell you could almost set your watch by it when ever you please. It's just the way our brains are naturally wired a bit differently.
1	He has high damage, but playing him feels so damn awkward. Like, except for W and R, his skills don't really interact or combo together in any way. Like, his laser is long range poke, but his Q is for short range trading? His kit is a mess.   Also, W is terrible for chasing since the unpack time is so damn long. I'd try the augment that improves it, but the stats that it gives compared to Augment Death aren't helpful.
1	Anything can be fixed with number tweaks.   Ashe just got her AS buffed from 3.4% to 4.0% and her pick/win rate is drastically higher than what it used to be.  Tristana got buffed from 3.0% to 4.0% and now Trist is  everywhere .  The worst part that Riot recognized that low stat growth is DEATH for an ADC, and then released Quinn (at  3.1% ) the same patch those two got buffed.   Give Quinn a base stats buff and I'd guarantee you she'd be played.   Give her Ashe/Tristana's attack speed per level (4% per level instead of 3.11%).  Or give her Draven's attack delay instead (-.08 instead of -.065).  Hell, even giving her Graves' AD (51 instead of 48) with Draven's AD growth (3.5 per level vs 3.0) would help.   Riot just doesn't want to buff characters  ever .  I can promise you I could make Quinn a viable carry overnight just by giving her 650 range like Caitlyn.
1	TF also plays mid whereas Nocturne is typically a jungle who can lane gank like no other jungle can thanks to his ult. It is a gap closer, but the 4s of darkness help, and he has damage on his ult. On top of that, TF's ult can be turned around a lot easier because of misposition, whereas Nocturne's is fail proof as long as you are in range (as far as positioning goes).
1	You should really give him a go. I'm a talon main and I wreck face whenever I personally use him. The thing is his single target burst is fantastic, and his w and r alone gives you 4 stacks of black cleaver on the entire enemy team setting your ADC up for cleaning up (that is if your not already doing it yourself). If they aren't a bruiser or mordekaiser, you pretty much always get a kill lv 6 granted you burst correctly. His w kinda tickles them at first and early game, but his ad scaling is GODLIKE(check his wiki page) so once you got some ad, your a monster. And don't buy a Triforce. Repeat don't buy a Triforce. People think it is really good with his q, but the fact is it ONLY really benefits his q. If you buy a BT for 1k less gold, your still increasing his q for roughly the same damage but also increasing the damage his w and r do as well. His q allows a double aa so he can push turrets like crazy, and his w can farm entire minion waves. Double buff IMO benefits him more then it would normally benefit a champion because of red procing his passive and blue giving him infinite fuel. Is short, he's fucking awesome. He even has a badass assassin's hood. If you even read this I'll post some links you should check out if your willing to reconsider IMO one of the biggest sleeper OP champs there are.
1	Or you choose to think it's a mess and fail to see its strenghts.   Even though the W might be bad for chasing, it's a game-changer during a teamfight in a tight spot. Combo it with R and your enemies have a bad time.   The W is also great counter to ganks and gap-closer based all-ins.   edit; also, R does retarded amounts of damage, but perhaps not everyone is able to acknowledge that, because the large part is DoT.   I guess the

1	I'd like to say something to the community if anybody cares to read. I'm from Argentina, 21 years old and i've always loved video games, specially online video games so i could play with my friends and speak to strangers.   I've played millions of games from mmorpgs to mmofps and lots of single players classics, i played every single day, that was my passion, still is, i can't help it. One day, talking with some of my gaming friends, he says to me -"Hey, we should check this game out...-". We were always checking games out, because we loved to. Unfortunatly for someone that lives in Argentina or the rest of L.A. you will have to get used to the fact that every single game you try, you'll have to try it with >200ms as latin servers are not even close as popular as North America or EU servers. Anyway, as we were used to that, i answered -"Meh... why not?"- not knowing that it was that game the one who i was going to fall in love with for the rest of the following years and that would turn out to become the most popular game in the world. Since that day, i've never wanted to play anything else than LoL. The competition in this game is huge and i love competition so much that it's impossible for me to quit it.   I and my friends started to get really into it and would spend days and nights playing, having a lot of fun and trying to become better players. We thought that having a high ping (around 250ms) was not a problem, that it was not holding us back in any aspect because "we were used to it" LOL. That was because we didn't know how having less than 50ms felt. Once the BR servers came up recently, i tried with a new account to see how the ping was like there. You people that have around 40ms every game probably already know: a TOTALLY.DIFFERENT.GAME. It killed us the fact that we were playing with such a disadvantage and transfers were not available to BR at that moment and we knew that L.A servers would never come because we had never seen a game with that server location. I'm pretty sure this happened to at least 90% of the latin community.   We've been waiting so long for this to happen that we thought it would never came, but it's finally here! 3 Years! The moment when i can tell my friends "Guys, we are not going to play League with 250 ping anymore!"   Let's try to make this new community the best one! For those people from another countries that are still waiting for a server, i wish you the best of luck and think about it, with L.A covered now you are most likely to be the next ones! Hold tight!
0	Did it a couple weeks ago, broke up a few weeks before that. Obviously painful, but only because the reason we separated was she didn't feel it was "the right time." She had just gotten out of an 11-month, relationship about 4^1/2 months before we got together, practically engaged relationship and literally less than a month after we broke up, she's dating another dude. For reals? It wasn't the right time after almost 5 months, but 1 more after that and you're good to go? My feels... :'c
1	This is in the FAQ of the Tribunal: >  Can I be banned for playing an unpopular champion?  > No, the Tribunal does not ban players for playing unpopular champions. You should feel empowered to play any champion you like, any way you like as long as you’re creating a positive experience for everyone in the game.   and >  Can I be banned for not playing the meta?  >  Players are not banned by the Tribunal for not playing the meta; they are banned for consistently creating negative experiences for others. > We have data suggesting that reviewers of Tribunal cases are very thoughtful and accurate in their verdicts, so if you were reported for not playing the meta but were being a positive player, you can expect to be judged fairly. > In general, players should feel empowered to play what they want and to try new strategies; however, this does not give you a license to be disrespectful or rude to your fellow gamers.   The key words in both of those statements is that a player has to create a bad experience for people  in the game . Unless you actually play a game with him and then determine for yourself that he creates a bad experience, he won't get banned. Even though there is a lot of outcry against him.   Someone posted a picture of him on Ryze playing with the same couple of players each time. If you yourself go to his lolking, you'll see that all his games on Shaco and Teemo (the games in question by OP) don't have those players in them.

One time, I didn't release it all, so during sex when it was just getting good, I ended up farting every other thrust.  I started laughing, she started hitting me while telling me not to stop, which only made me laugh more.  All the while, though I was hoping these were only going to be farts, I had to not only focus on her, but focus on making sure I don't gamble with a fart and lose.

0	Not to say that men are not held up to unrealistic standards, but the situation isn't the same.   We as men get a lot more of a pass for not meeting those standards. That isn't to say they don't cause mental harm. I have more than my fair share of body image issues, and while I've mostly gotten over my body dysmorphia, it does affect me sometimes. I have personal stake in how much value is placed on appearance in society, because it's one of the things that's caused me the most mental anguish in my life. However, we are shown in various forms of media that we are more than our looks. Yes, things are easier when you're conventionally attractive (which I also have firsthand experience with, having switched sides of the fence thanks to an unhealthy amount of exercise and a fortuitous puberty), but we do also have plenty of traits that are valued higher in men.   Those male characters you mention are not just attractive. They're also brave, resourceful, intelligent, etc. They're generally more fleshed-out, and their sexuality is not at the forefront of their imagery or characterization. And while I don't play enough video games to think of examples of this in that particular medium, in television and film, you see actors like Kevin James, Jonah Hill, and Seth Rogen with women generally considered to be far more attractive than them. This sends the message that they have traits that are more valuable than their looks. You'd never see that happen with Rebel Wilson or Melissa McCarthy, for example (unless it was played for laughs). Female characters are shown as being shallow if they don't see past the looks of those actors' characters, but it would not be shown the other way around.   I don't think Anita Sarkeesian was trying to say that men are never sexualized, but that women are never  not  sexualized, especially in video games. And hell, outside of media, how many criticisms of Hilary Clinton start with knocks on her looks or hair? How many interviews with women in politics and media revolve around their diets or what they wear instead of what work they've done? How many interviews with men do that?   The problem with the Men's Rights movement is not that it's trying to solve the issues men face. There are issues we face, and they should be solved. But the MRM tends to point fingers at the wrong people and act as though others' problems are either not real or not important.

0	Law Enforcement Officers of Reddit already know they are being recorded. They have dash cams and the US Government are working on "Pin Cams" Cameras pinned to the front shirt of each and every officer. Officers that you see over-reacting are often doing so because they just chased this bastard for a mile and he threw the first punch. Officer's deal with an extremely high daily stress rate and on the job hazard, its entirely within their right to defend themselves in any way they see fit (within reason). These Officers go out every day with a target on their chest and stand in the face of danger and crime so that you don't have to and still they get this stigma of being cruel and brutal.
0	Semi-related story time! I applied to Office Depot a couple weeks ago. They called me shortly after to come in and take an assessment test. Got a call the next day asking to set up an interview. Scheduled the date, go to the store the day of the interview and after waiting for 30 minutes they tell me the hiring manager isn't at the store. Reschedule the interview for the next day the same time. An hour before the interview they send me a generic email saying the spot was filled and they didn't get a chance to look at my resume.
0	A really good tool in the job hunt is www.glassdoor.com. This site allows users to post their application/hiring experience with a company. The larger the company, the more complete the info. My wife had 4 interviews with a company, including one with the VP of HR (she works in HR), and then heard nothing. She found glassdoor and read that this company was famous for this kind of unprofessional crap. It helped her feel better knowing it was just a jerky company and not something she did. Glassdoor also gives you insight on interview styles and even the questions asked in the interviews.
1	I actually completely agree with you.  Not about Shen though.  I know how to play him pretty well, cause I normally play top lane/jungle.  For other champions though, there are just times where I have no idea how anybody could be bad with them.  When I first picked up Lee Sin, I genuinely couldn't understand how people would do so poorly with him.  His whole kit screams "I'm going to outplay you".  And I mesh really well with any champs that have gap closers.  Mainly ones with multiples dashes though.  Except Ahri.  Fk dat hoe.  I have no idea how to play her.   My point is that I understand how a champion is played through viewing it.  I watch streams.  I watch tournaments, I watch both NA and EU LCS.  I understand how a champion is supposed to work before I even play it.   We are not the vast majority.  Champs do not make sense to everybody.  In fact, there are a few champs that I have no idea what I'm doing with.  Anivia and Ahri are prime examples of this.  I can play other APCs, but not them.  Most people only have a champion pool of maybe 10 or so champs they can play comfortably.  And maybe about two they can play top notch with.  I can play top notch with at least five champs, and can play almost every single champion proficiently.  Though some of them are inherently not good.  (I'm looking at you Karma/Heimer)

1	My question is related to the Trundle rework. I understand the thought behind redoing his lore and look to be more a part of the world. I don't like it, but it's a good thought and I won't be complaining about it here. I will focus purely mechanically.   Overall, Trundle can go Top fairly well now, something he couldn't before. But he lost his amazing jungle status. The lowered damage on early ranks of Q wreck his clear time, the increased healing on W doesn't balance out for the extra hits from mobs you'll be taking (Because of the decreased clear times), and the reduced duration on the E is just a weird random nerf.   The worst change, I feel, was the removal of his CC reduction. That was the big element of what made Trundle's ganks actually good. It defined Trundle. It allowed him to take an entire enemy team to the face and tough it out, very fitting for his character. I mean, after you nerfed Singed's ult in the same way, it's starting to seem like you're just hating on CC reduction.   For good reason, I suppose. If you're not an experienced player, it can be difficult to counter a tank with that much tenacity. But either way, it hurts his ganks and late game performance so much that it's not worth the extra healing and attack speed, in my personal opinion.   I would like to focus just on this factor here. Why have you made Trundle such a worse jungler in exchange for top lane game? I don't think it's versatility. I'd even say the jungling with him effectively now is nigh-impossible.  I'm just a concerned Trundle main, and I'd like to know why you changed things so drastically.
1	As much as I want to see more Mount Targon I would rather see a city state with a lot of old champions gettings VU rather then focusing somewhere new straight away. Like having a Bandle City/Noxus/Demacia and bring a new champ out for them while also updating more of the older ones like Garen and Tristana would be time better spend imo.
1	Frankly, I don't care. I'm not into the lore or anything, but the stuff you are and were doing before the Freljord patch, before Zac and before Quinn... It's just awesome. The characters come to life before we've even met them.

That said, the sort of jerk-o who would actually look you up and down is probably not the empathetic person who would actually stop their car and let another human being have the right of way.
0	Yawn. The conception and entirety of the offensive comic genre begs to differ. And given Reddit's tendency to reward satirical witticism with the oh so fabled upboats, it is no wonder people go to extremes outside their true beliefs in pursuit of said upboats.   Additionally, you can't make a blanket statement that "the [hypothetical] statement still stands" because there are a lot of factors like age, race, sex, community (Reddit), connotation in relation to context, et cetera that define the interpretation of a statement.   And lastly, I personally enjoy when people get riled up over subject material on the principle of the material itself with no basis on the intent or context of the material and am typically motivated to take things further or troll or whatever you want to call it. Just something to consider on your white knight crusade against the evil mysogynistic/racist/homophobic/probably-actually-good-people-afk crowd.
0	I never told you how to interpret anything, no need to be so riled up.   I'm just saying that there is value in examining what is said in a joke. The statement stands as long as it's not deleted. It's obvious to be taken with grains of salt and all, but it's of value to examine a joke. What is the point of the joke, where does it's humor come from and how does it relate to our culture. A joke can inform, rabble or denounce. All of those can be good jokes.
0	Actually I just reminded myself of another karma related occasion.  In first grade I sat next to a kid who also was named Luke.  We had to be quiet for some reason, but I decided to be an A-hole and talk to the people around me.  Anyways teacher heard me, then said "Luke, put your name on the board!"  (Putting your name on the board meant no recess for you.) The teacher continued her work, and I turned to the Luke on my right, nudged him, and whispered to him to put his name on the board.  He looked at me in disbelief and actually wrote it down.  He asked me later what he had done to deserve the punishment, and I responded that I had not the faintest clue.
1	LP gains are based on the MMR (elo) distance to next promotion series.   Player 1 @ Silver 1 has 1600 MMR, 70 LP.   Player 2 @ Silver 1 has 1500 MMR, 90 LP.   Gold 5 is 1550 MMR.   Player 1 wins a game and gains 30 LP -> enters series. He already had the MMR needed for promotion series so the system really wants him there.   Player 2 wins a game and gains 3 LP and +15 MMR, is now at 1515 MMR of the 1550 needed for series. Distance to series 35 MMR, but only 7 LP. Next games will be worth the around the same +3 LP, +15 MMR for wins. Losses can be like -15 LP, -15 MMR, but it doesn't mean much.   The weak LP gains like player 2 has are common in division 1 of EVERY league. That's because the MMR distance between leagues is greater than the distance between divisions within the league. Only at Diamond 1 the LP truly shows the distance to promotion series I think.
0	OP, my wonderful pair of aunties has been together almost 44 years. They came out together in the summer of 69 and both have very conservative parents. Things weren't great for them but eventually their family accepted it. Long story short, 44 years later they are happier than ever. Knowing and loving them as a pair since I was born has been one of THE main factors in my acceptance of homosexuality. Your grandfather is a dick, but his overreaction may actually benefit you in an odd way. Your mom and dad might be more accepting to buffer the pain your grandfather has just caused you. I hopebthe best for you.
1	The worst thing about MIA/ss is: What would you rather watch out of the corner of your eye? The chat where you see an occasional ss or the minimap that constantly gives you highly strategic info?   I feel so degraded when our top laner doesn't ward or look at the minimap, and then dies saying: "Nice ss" (you can literally feel the irony dripping from these words)

Lee's mid game isn't good at all if you're behind and his late game, even if you're 6 item, is trash.   So at that point lee is a gambling play maker. He had to try and make plays otherwise lee is a useless champ (does no damage and once he goes in he's in for good)
0	If that's what people think Sonics fans did/were supposed to do, they are gravely mistaken.   Let me put it this way (and this is not based on my own feelings as a fan): Once Seattle gets a team again (whether it be through expansion or relocation) OKC will probably end up being our rival, based purely on the spite and contentment most fans around here harbor towards the "OKC Franchise".   Seattle has gotten screwed over by the NBA (the deal really should have ended up like our attempts to acquire the SA Kings or we should have gotten the Kings, not this middle ground we find ourselves in), and it is just one more instance that continues to perpetuate this persona of Seattle being an underdog (the very same reason we are so electrified over the recent emergence of the Seahawks as a respectable team in the eyes of the NFL, or at least no longer a joke team in a joke league).   I can see why most people around here do not support the Thunder, I agree with the sentiment on most counts, but I do not extend that to the players themselves. I will always enjoy watching Kevin Durant play just as I still love watching Ray Allen on the Heat and when he was with the Celtics (I even came to love Russel Westbrook and James Harden through their championship run last year) but the fact remains that our scum bag owner did a scum bag deal with another owner that was allowed by scum bag Stern and would not hear any other proposals that sprung up in 2008, and our investors made a FAR more impressive deal than Sacramento did to keep the Kings. We were robbed of a team and we are not going to support the franchise now that it has been taken from us.
1	I had a very similar experience, except it was my friend who ks'd my penta. We were playing 5s in normal queue and I was adc Ashe. At some point we were pushing mid and I was just sitting back during a team fight auto-attacking. Enemy has been slain... Double Kil... Triple kill... QUADRA Kill... and there last person was running back behind their inhib turret with like 1000 health. Our cho hits a Q, I auto-attack, and then  FEAST he ksed my penta when I was one or two auto attacks away. I was so pissed I sold all my items and just got max CDR and AP so I'd just spam arrows every 40 seconds for the rest of the game.

0	A bit of advice in the future. When you're on the internet, it's pretty fucking silly to talk about having a rational argument. Rational argumentation takes place IN PERSON or at least over webcam where refutation can take an effective foothold. Arguing over the internet only appeals to intellectual cowards.   Now if you'd like me to educate your in person, we can have a live debate over webcam if you'd like.   >Your behavior in an anonymous environment lends me to believe you are an uneducated and or unstable person. That does not engender a desire to meet you in person, so I will happily decline that offer. The way one behaves in an anonymous environment is indicative of the way one would behave were one not constrained by society's expectations. Your behavior and arguments so far reflect poorly upon you. You appear as a child railing against, what he sees as, oppression by some authority figure. Perhaps instead of insulting people and immediately escalating arguments to the point of internet screaming, you could state your case in a logical and rational manner. This approach is much more likely to get a positive response, and you may even be able to convince people to see your point of view. Your arguments and response are very similar to that of people when confronted with arguments that conflict with their worldview. Instead of arguing against a statement attacks are made against the person who made the statement. This is an attempt to discredit the person who made the statement as opposed to discrediting the validity of the statement. It is commonly referred to as an ad hominem attack. Another form of argument, which I have seen you use, is to redirect the statement as equivalent to something else which is only mildly connected and perceived as much worse. this is referred to as a straw man attack. All that said you could also just be a troll, in which case I'm wasting my time.

A friend's girlfriend prohibited him getting braces (his teeth are really fucked up) because "he only wanted to look better for all the whores out there" (that's literal, my friend had her on speaker when she said this). She was mad when he got a job because "he was going to see all the whores that work there". Hell she even gave him her car so he wouldn't "see all the whores in the street".

1	TBH I often face SoloQ player who really hate DuoQ player without any obvious reason. We join and kindly ask "premade with XXX, pref botlane" and Summoner 1 starts "OMFG premades always throw games" and locks heimerdinger with revive and clarity. This happens Silver 1 ELO fairly often. I seems there is a huge gap between SoloQ and DuoQ players that they keep on blaming each other leading to a vicious circle. As I do only play DuoQ without beeing toxic I can not judge whether most DuoQ's are toxic or not as we never get teamud up with any other.
1	It seem like you are jumping on the "gg duos always suck" train and the points you make don't really make sense to me. You said that duos tend to be difficult to bargain with, there are several things about this statement that i don't think are true. First of all I don't believe that "most" duos are difficult to deal with, It may seem like it to you because the duos who are cooperative don't announce themselves as duos and thus you go the whole game thinking they are just two normal non-toxic players. Secondly this "difficulty bargaining with duos" is usually because they tend to have first pick and last pick, so yeah they get first choice in which role they take just like any other player would if they so desire. Riot endorsed pick order and so there should be no problem with this. My third issue with your statement is the idea that people are playing roles they "aren't comfortable with". 'A' you shouldn't play ranked if expect to play 1 role every single game, there are always going to be players who have higher pick than you and decide that they want your role, but there is absolutely nothing you can do about that other than politely ask for the role you'd like. Adding to this point, although there is like a tiny bit higher chance that you wont get what you want with a duo, (because if they are uncooperative/want your role there is a 2/5 chance they are higher pick than you as opposed to 1/5) this is hardly a significant enough number to say that duos are a significant problem. Finally your issue with duos flaming seems rather inconsistent with my experiences, although i have definitely played with the type of duo you are describing here, i think that what i have experienced much more is the entire team flaming the duos from the min they make a single mistake making the claim "gg duos always suck" or something along those lines.       In saying all of this I also want to recognize that I have MANY times experienced the types of duos you are describing, my point is just that it's unfair to classify the majority of duos like this just because a small portion rage, flame, and make the game unbearable. If you disagree with any of the points PLEASE feel free to criticize. Hopefully this isn't overly harsh :)
0	So the logic of this follows that there was some sort of organized agenda to the riots? That the UK riots happened because they were pissed of with the "Government"? Even though the later statement is a small part of the truth it is somewhat simple Simon bullshit. Let me clarify what I mean by asking some questions.   In your experience do council estate kids often or even sometimes start organizing themselves in to huge country wide social action groups but then get it wrong? Could the riots have ANYTHING to do with huge swathes of a generation being totally disenfranchised from society and the law due to the said law, or lack thereof, ending free higher education or the progressive end of "on the job training" for example? Could being stuck in poverty with no hope of escape be a factor? Could it have anything to do with the criminal justice act, the war on drugs and the changes in stop and search powers being used by the police to criminalize huge amounts of people but also to fill quotas? Is there ANY way these kids are so twisted by the world around them that this behavior manifested itself as soon as an opportunity arose? Or did they plan it all from the start? Could it have anything to do with problems in the education system and social care? Basically what I am asking is, could the riots have been a symptom of serious social issues or should we just blame it on the poor people?   When the cops fish for drug users at my local station with dogs on a Friday night, totally failing to arrest dealers but turning huge groups of otherwise law abiding kids in to criminals, everyone who gets arrested there looks at the legal system as a joke when they can't get taken seriously over violent crime in their neighborhoods. Those numbers add up quick. This is not a bunch of kids who got together to show their discontent with the "Government" in some sort of organized process of "riot creation". This is clearly an organic symptom of wide spread destitution and thus disenfranchisement. I don't agree with it but calling it the "fault" of the rioters, lets the administration off the hook in a literally insane way. Even though it happened all over the country at separate times people seem to think it was organized in some way and not a domino effect symptomatic of incredibly wide social problems. Does anyone think they were intelligently making a political point on mass and thus organized themselves in an intentional manor? Or could it be a natural occurrence when you have a "mob" that doesn't respect the law? As soon as you answer these questions honestly you have to stop righting it off as a group of young people being hypocrites and you have to look at some pretty serious underlying societal problems.   OPs meme only works when you're talking about an individual and not a huge group and yet it refers to them as a group. Rioters. The government must take responsibility for endemic social issues just as much as individuals must take responsibility for their actions. As we know, mob mentality makes people do some crazy shit. Individually, sure, assholes. But as a non organized group? Should we not be asking how this happened rather than pointing our impotent little fingers? This is not black and white and this silly re post does seem to characterize it as such.
1	1) Team comp is everything. The reason why we have the typical bruiser top, ap mid, adc supp bot, bruiser/tank jungle is because that's what works. You need a combination of CC, damage and tankiness to win the game. You didn't mention who was on your team. Most likely your team had no synergy at all. 2) You can't call Vayne imbalanced when it takes more skill to outplay with her than many other (if not all other) carries. 3) You say you didn't throw, yet you lost the game. Clearly you threw, then. Whether it was your overconfidence which led to making arrogant plays, not taking objectives, allowing the enemy to farm up, whatever. You threw. If you have a lead on someone, you keep that lead on them throughout the game, no matter what. Playing top? Beat them to a pulp, ward, and beat them down more, because you KNOW their jungler will come to help them get back on track.
0	You seem to assume that anything that can be done using a dictionary is automatically done quickly and/or easily. This is not the case. I've shown you the math for this, but you've disregarded it. Please read what I typed again. Slowly, this time.   I'm comparing a) random letters in a password to b) passwords made up of one or more words.   The examples of b) passwords made up of words, assume that you're  only  checking actual words, hence a "dictionary attack".   If you're doing a dictionary attack, and your dictionary contains 10 thousand words, you'll need to try an average of 5K times before you find the word. This is of course, assuming the word is in there. This is indeed doable, and relatively quick.   If you combine 4 words, which are guaranteed to be in the dictionary you use to attack, you'll still need a maximum of 10,000,000,000,000,000 tries. See how that scales up? Furthermore, that is  not  considering variations or typos. If you make one deliberate typo in one of those words, you'll be trying that many times and  not finding  the password.   Edit:
0	Fine, a more technically nuanced reply.   You are talking about brute-forcing a password. That's a retard's game.   What you don't seem to understand is that passwords scale up exponentially. Hardware does not.   If I have a password that takes  x  tries to brute-force, if I add ONE letter, that same password is suddenly 26 times as difficult to crack. Not counting upper/lowercase or numbers.   How many times more powerful is your hypothetical hardware than a $400 laptop? 26 times? It's not. But if I were really paranoid, I add  yet another  single letter. Now the password will take almost SEVENHUNDRED times the time to brute force than the password I started out with. Can you buy a system that's 700x more powerful than a $400 laptop?
0	No, it makes complete sense.   Think of a letter and a dictionary word as the same thing. For my shitty math, we need to know how many words there are in a dictionary. The Oxford contains about 170K current words, but let's assume 2048 (2^11 ), ok?     a password of  1 letter  can be  26  different things   a password of  2 letters  can be  676  (26*26) different things   a password of  8 letters or numbers  can be  2,821,109,907,456  different things (36^8 ).   a password of  1 word  (of our fictional dict) can be  2048  different things.   a password of  2 words , can be  4,194,304  things (2048*2048 or 2^22 ), indeed less than 8 letters/numbers.   a password of  4 words  can be 17,592,186,044,416 (2^44 ) things, or  6.2 times the 8 letters/numbers  combination, which is a common demand (8 length, at least one number).     If you don't just use the (borderline silly) two thousand most common words, but use words from the 10% most common words of the dictionary (which would be approx. 17K out of 170K), it radically changes things.   Then,  four words  would yield 17000^4 or 83,521,000,000,000,000 possibilities. Or, for comparison,  slightly more than 2^56  , which is  pretty goddamn safe .   [Source on Oxford dict. size](
0	I had a similar issue a couple of years ago. I was at a party and a drunk acquaintance came up to say hello, holding his SLR with a new lens. He taps me on the shoulder (hello gesture) and I do the same. He drops his camera and breaks his lens. I ended up pitching in a 100 bucks to help him out (only because he was an alright guy) but told him to fuck off when he asked me to buy a new one for 400 bucks... Hope it turns out alright for you.
1	Without AP her heal is nothing and her spears deal no damage   Attack speed steroid during trades doesn't do jack either, I presume? And spears chunk even up till lane ends unless they buy MR- in which case you've won the itemization.   >her traps aren't as good as caitlyn's in bot because they do (very little) damage instead of being CC   Yup, 10 (?) seconds of vision and a great AR/MR shred is just bad.   >she has a totally useless ultimate and she is useless in teamfights even when she's the AP mid   Yeah, lemme tell you a COMPLETE EXTRA SET OF SPELLS is so useless, especially when you cast the whole rotation and switch back while you're other spells are on CD. And if you're trying to have teamfights as Nidalee, you're doing it wrong. You get picks and splitpush with a Nidalee.   Also, lemme throw a few numbers at you. Sona's heal vs Nidalee's heal.   Sona- 40 / 60 / 80 / 100 / 120 on a 7 second CD, with 6/7/8/9/10 bonus AR/MR   Nidalee- 50 / 85 / 120 / 155 / 190 on a 10 second CD, with 20 / 30 / 40 / 50 / 60% AS   Higher base heal at every rank, higher AP scaling on it, and once you hit rank 3 of the heal, the actual heal per second balances out with each other, and the swings into Nidalee's favor. And while 6 AR/MR might trump 20% AS, 8 AR/MR doesn't trump 40% AS.   >A mediocre AS steroid isn't enough to be a good support.   Which, I feel obligated to mention, even her 20% AS is more than you get from a Zeal. Also 15% more than Nunu's Blood Boil at max rank- I realize the MS and the 100% uptiime on Blood Boil makes it a lot better, but the AS is comparable. and Nid's only has 3 seconds downtime if you have 0 CDR.

0	When I had my last child I was 170 lbs  which is chubby for 5'7" but not bad post partum.   Today I am 275. In just 7 years.  The doctor said there was nothing wrong with me, I should exercise.    I haven't had fast food in two years nor soda in 18 months. I put in minimum 30 minutes on the eliptical daily until I'm in so much pain from my knees and ankles that I have been prescribed narcotics. Recently it was discovered that the Mirena IUD the doctors fitted me with after the birth of my child can cause uncontrolled weight gain in some individuals.  This was NOT  a specified side effect of the medication although now there are lawsuits.  I have been riduculed harrased bullied and nearly committed suicide as the weight and horrible teasing got to me (emotional issues IS a side effect of my Mirena).   Thank you, random redditor for not hating me based solely on a condition I am now trying to rectify.  I have an appointment to change my birth control method and the nutritionist is going to try y to help me not need gastric bypass to be normal again.  No, I have no intention of joing the lawsuits but maybe I should?   What would you do?
0	Let me clarify. If the reason for a persons obesity were avoidable (i.e., not a medical condition as determined by DSHS), it wouldn't be right for them, specifically, to be able to collect disability pay. This would put more strain on the systems ability to help people with non self inflicted disabilities.
1	I'll see your idea and raise you my own...   First it might not be popular but I think the best thing is to actually take prizes out of the equation. Instead what you get is a team record that shows your points and play against teams at your level for that weeks events. There are also achievements for doing things for example making all your matches on time Mordekaiser IronMan achievement or going on a league winning streak while also increasing your ranked 5's rating earns your team the Katarina Voracity achievement.   Format: Simple automated systems that allows for self contained 3 team Bo1 round robin matches. Reporting is largely or entirely automated as is match making and lobby forming using tournament code. Teams are matched with like teams within their tier using snake seeding across the entire pool of entrants. Team captains get an in game message with link to a draft players and optionally reserve players. A second in game message then goes to all captains showing their opponents team lineups.   Points System: 1 point per on time appearance per match with a full team of starters. 2 points per match for a win. 1 point for a loss. At the end of a period say once a month matches are played out and teams get their points recorded and a rating assigned.   Prizing: Get a record for your team and have at least three matches per week against teams at your general skill level. Have some achievements based on your play and sportsmanship.   Costs: Development costs to improve the client and website backend especially storage and sorting of teams on short notice. Need a better announcement or persistent message generation/status. My suggestion is a streaming website dedicated to this venture on each platform probably comprised of three VPS instances (sort and report, achievement, record recording and display). At no time does this system touch the actual ranked 5's data except to read data on the team from Ranked 5's.
1	I think it wouldn't actually be too hard for riot to incoprorate something like this into the client - it needn't have prizes beyond say a 5 win ip boost and some nebulous end of season rewards to encourage participation.   The way I envision it, you'd simply sign your ranked team up for a tournament queue (which would only be open at certain times/on certain days), and the matchmaker would find a set of similar ranked teams, and draw up brackets for you - Allowing you to spectate other games in the tournament if your round finished before the rest.   In order to make sure such games are completed in reasonable timeframe, it could enforce a "be here within 10 minutes" rule after the brackets are drawn, and could keep brackets small (no more than 8 or 16 teams).
0	This is known as CSS reflow. It happens when someone doesn't specify the exact height and width for something in a website, and when the website loads it, it can sometimes turn out to be bigger than the browser allocated space for, so it makes the website "shift around" quite a bit as it tries to make room for it.
1	I have two things I want to improve, the first is  MOTIVATION TO PLAY THE GAME MORE SERIOUSLY  and the second is teamfighting.   I don't take the game as seriously as other people at me division do (gold 1) Most of them are pushing for platinum, and I never troll in ranked, ever, I play to win, but I don't take the game as seriously as I would like to. The main reason is because I don't care about my elo/division, if I was in bronze I would be happy, as long as every game went by, I was improving at the game. I don't feel any motivation to take the game as seriously as the 4 other players on my team, and I feel like a bad teammate for doing so, I feel like i'm letting down the people on my team because of this.   So my question is there any good motivator to take this game more seriously?   I feel like i'm a pretty good mechanical player in general, I do well in lane, but ussualy struggle to grasp my role once teamfights start rolling around. I main top lane, and the champions I love playing are Riven/Rumble/Renekton/Shen and Vladimir.   When it comes to Riven, Vlad and Rumble I feel like I do well in teamfights, but when I play Renekton and Shen I have issues grasping my role. Ussualy when I play shen, I'll have a sunfire cape, and i'll go to a different lane than my team and split push, I feel like I have good timing on my ults, and I can land them on the right target, but when I ult in, I don't feel like im playing well, I feel like im getting kited by the ezreal, I can't catch the Ahri, their zac is bouncing all over my twitch, and I just want to cry out and try to figure out what I'm doing wrong.   When I play renekton, I feel like unless I have flash up, I can't do anything to their backline.
0	As someone who had to commute 2.5 hours in order to attend 9am classes at university, it would annoy me no end that some students on campus would (a) not even bother coming in, or (b) turn up late. Particularly when they would later ask for your lecture notes or help with assignments.   What frustrated me even more was a day on which we were all to give individual presentations. I deliberately booked myself on an even earlier morning train to ensure I made the presentation on time, but was foiled by the service being cancelled. I turned up late, and despite explaining the circumstances behind me missing the appointed time, was still deducted marks. Apparently 'if it was a presentation at the WHO, I'm sure you would have made it on time'.
0	Meh, I suppose, but I do think I went a bit overboard with my soapbox speech. I'm ashamed for sounding sexist towards both sexes. It was not my intent, but somehow it came out that way. I always seem to screw opinions like this up. I really do think revealing clothes is an issue that needs to be discussed, but without having to navigate through all this  bullshit. Every time I have to say, "No, I'm not advocating rape." and "I'm not saying women shouldn't be proud of their bodies." (which, if you think about it, makes their argument about how women are sexualized hypocritical, they're doing it to themselves), and all that, and my original topic gets lost, as you said. So
0	rant>   Here's a problem I had as an English prof: There's really no such thing as a "perfect" citation page. With the myriad sources one can draw from these days, it's just impossible to come up with a standard for all of them. I mean, read the most recent MLA format for web sources. It's literally a list of, like, 15 different (if available) bits, with the only truly necessary one being "Name of Website." Okay, but what do I use as the name of the website? It's not always clear.   I realize that this isn't super difficult for, say, a HS paper, or a 100-200 level college paper because you're probably just referencing a few books and a website or two, but I just published a paper not too long ago. I think I used entries in MLA, APA, and God knows what else just to account for random things. "Here's a French pamphlet on the pragmatic implications of interrogative structures in discourse written in 1907 that I could only find on an obscure section of MIT's web resources, and all I have is author and year of publication..." Yeah, close enough has to be good enough for something like that.   </rant>
0	Myself and my friend in elementary school were the only Hispanic girls in our class and all the black girls refused to talk to or play with us and discouraged or threatened other black girls from doing so.   Then I went to an all Hispanic school where I was left out because I didn't speak Spanish. I understood a lot though and kids would come up saying mean things about me thinking I couldn't understand them.
0	which it sounds like it is. I'm siding with OP on this one because I've had black people be racist towards me. I was a 6th grader when I first experienced racist remarks towards me. I was a chubby mixed kid (white/south American) and some black guy called me a wetback because I walked in front of him. I recall how shocked I was because here I am transitioning from happy go-lucky elementary school to this situation. In High School I had the pleasure of facing the very same person in a wrestling match. Broke his nose when I went in for a double leg takedown because i went for a head but. He was DQ'ed because they couldn't control his bleeding after he ran out of timeout time. I didn't shake his hand and I told him why. It didn't matter that he was black but unfortunately for me, I link that specific scenario, like others do with other things, to black people. [most of the time when they don't seem approachable]. I know it's wrong but it's something that I can't really control.
0	Because reddit is mostly made up of white people, and skews towards the young. Fewer young people are actively racist than other age groups, and older white racists tend to be quiet about it unless they're delusional and don't realize they're racist.   As a result, there are openly racist non-white people and quietly racist white people. Younger people who haven't lived through worse times are less likely to understand the impact that racism still has on the lives of non-whites.   Meanwhile, black people being racist against white people has negligible real life consequences. The vast majority of businesses, apartments, etc, are owned by white people, and discrimination by black people against white people has minimal impact. The vast majority of police officers are white, with the implications there regarding profiling.
0	Well unless you've experienced very similar encounters with other races and don't feel the same way about them then I'd imagine this would come under some form of reverse habituation, not racism.   For example: If I see a guy walking towards me in a shirt and tie, a metal tshirt, general goth gear, or in hipster regalia then I'm very much at ease. When I see someone walking towards me in a white tracksuit, polo shirt, and baseball cap, I get ready to have to defend myself or gtfo of there. Is that prejudiced? Definitely. But it has still saved me from losing money and phones in attempted muggings, and limited my get-stabbed-counter to one time only.
0	So... because its an example, I can't critique it?   I'm saying your 'example scenario' is bad. It actually functions to counter the point you were trying to make: that this 'hypothetical' situation (the likes of which still happen all the time, and which actually occurred in the 60's in the context of life insurance), which is called racist, really isn't because  mathematicians don't lie, and therefore it's fine for this hypothetical company x to charge blacks more. In short, that the concept of systemic racism is flawed. It isn't. I'll use your example.   Math  doesn't lie. Blacks actually do end up in more traffic incidents, being incarcerated more, and dying at a younger age. However, of course, the cause of this is not that they are genetically or w/e predisposed to being bad drivers, criminals or dying at a young age.   >So does "new racism" supersede math?   The  math  doesn't say that it is, though. Racism says this. The conclusion that blacks are worse drivers is a result of racism. A non-racist conclusion is one which looks at the  context  in which blacks have no choice but to live their lives in, and finds causation in this  context , not in the  population  or  individuals .   Following this, the next logical question of racism is "should poor company X, then, have to take the hit to their profits, as they don't actively create this context?" Of course, and for at least two reasons.   First, by profiting from this context, a company is incentivizing the maintenance that context. A real world example of this is South Africa, wherein business investment in this country allowed for apartheid to continue; it was only after boycott and divestment occurred that the systemic racism of apartheid was weakened enough for it to be dismantled to the extent that it has been. Would it be racist for a company to continue investment in South Africa in the face apartheid? Certainly.   Second, it assumes that the well being of Company X, Y or Z is of more significance than the well-being of minority popullation X, Y or Z. To illuminate this point further, I ask the counter-question: "Should we really care about the survival of a company who must exploit systemic racism in order to profitably exist?" No.
1	I've been trying to get good with Zed a lot recently because I know he's extremely strong when you have the mechanics and skill to play him, but I think I won't ever play him again because     I know I will never be on Faker's level.     I am not worthy of trying to reach his level
0	In all honesty, and serious respect to those veterans that aren't like this, i had a collage freshman veteran in my intro to botany class who was almost the exact opposite.  He was an extreme bro who showed up late almost every class, was extremely disruptive when doing so, and spent most of his time during lecture trying to pick up chicks by showing his navy tattoos and telling stories.  How can someone who served be like this?   (on the other hand, though, i did meet someone else who served in the navy doing patrol for drug smugglers/pirates in the Arabian sea/the Philippians in a chem class who was a very stand up guy, with a serious want to learn.  I suppose everyone is different)
0	As a teacher I really like these guys. Had two in my last class, both were awesome in their own way. Both were former Navy guys. One constantly talked about his time in the Navy, but also asked lots of good questions, kept the class going, made it fun. The other was a former SEAL who just showed up, crushed his work, and got the highest grade I have ever given.  They don't complain, they get shit done, and generally know more about what they want out of an education, which is nice.
0	26 and just transferred to a new college.  I am an old man here it seems.  I watch the 18 or 19 year olds go off to party, get wasted, and fuck whilst I sit on a bench.  But I figure it's fine for them, I lived that life and don't need to go back.  I have a small number of acquaintances who I can go out with for dinner or what have you, they're mostly 19 or 20 but they're good people and don't go in for the booze and parties.
0	That's why I said I didn't want to overgeneralize, I was just answering your question not judging anyone, you were the one saying that 18~24 and 45+ people act dumb in college, I just made a point that it may be because you haven't meet the right kind of people.   Also, you were the one judging the work ethics, just because you meet some dick military vets, doesn't mean the ones that attend college after that are the same kind of people.   Disclaimer : I'm not a vet, but I got back at college after having had to leave some 10 years ago for monetary issues after almost completing all the necessary courses (had to work full time and move a few times and just couldn't keep up), just got back 1 and half years ago (in a different course than the first time, because screw it), and the reason I don't screw around is not because I don't want to, is because it fucking costs me, it must be the same for those vets, it's not that they don't want to screw around, is just that they don't want to spend too many years having to attend college, many freshman that come from high school don't have that mentality till they are halfway college and realize they won't make it in time.
0	It's a double edged sword, especially at the intro level courses.   1: Expect most of them to be dumber than rocks. It's not their fault, for the most part they have not been taught how to think critically in High School... so that will be a significant portion of the intro level classes. One example: Intro to chem, lab experiment to measure the density of an egg by measuring the density of the solution it "just floats" in, they hear the instructor talking about weighing measuring the different volumetric devices  to get the mass of the solution. First instruction in the manual " measure out 500mL water and add NaCl until the egg floats between the bottom of the beaker and the top of the solution".... what do they think to do? "Weigh the empty beaker right?" The good part of it is, in lab or group based classes, you have to teach them, and the best way to  really  learn something is to teach / tutor someone else.   2: It gets better once you start getting to 200 level classes.  By then the ones who can't / won't learn to think and the ones who don't even bother to show up to class are weeded out.  300 level classes generally are the dedicated ones who will graduate with you, you probably won't even notice the age gap anymore.
1	I feel kind of dirty by cheering for Vulcun since I really wanted CLG, C9 TSM worlds but omg it feels so good to win O_O
1	I agree that Vulcun is better than TSM. I was actually surprised to hear they came in as 3rd seed.   Also, I've always thought that NA was better than EU this season. It is very obvious, and remember: EU has only won against other EU teams today.  TSM beat GG.eu, SKT Beat Lemondogs, VUL beat FNC.   They seem to just be outclassed this year, and if the other EU teams were better than FNC, they would have beat them in a best-of. A lot of people are saying the same thing about CJ Frost because MadLife is on it, but a team is only as good as its record.
1	Okay so, this is gonna sound extremely harsh, but I feel this needs to be said.   Why the fuck should you as a  duo queue somehow have priority over other people, just because "you enjoy playing together"  You duo queue for two reasons. 1. because you enjoy spending time / playing with said partner, you have fun on voice coms, etc etc. 2. You want to reduce the risk of getting that retard on your team, that we all know and love, ie 0/9/1 by 10 minutes, who's constantly flaming the jungler for not ganking.
0	Here's the deal with lifting and grunting. There is a difference between struggling because you're pushing yourself, and just making noise to draw attention and feed off your own testosterone. Most gyms have a couple of guys that act like they're making angry love to the weights. It's not everyone who grunts or drops weights, it's a rare few. Most people conduct themselves with class and are simply trying to get fit and it's most always obvious. However, there are those douches who do make a spectacle of their work out. You will know that's going down by the amount of rolled eyes and cringed faces you see on the by standards, trying not to be distracted by those raging (likely steroid induced) ultra masculine amateur bodybuilders hoping to distract from their small penises.
0	Dropping weights if you're lifting heavy prevents damage that setting the weights down gently does not, iirc. Especially with heavy stuff.   Grunting is also a sign of exertion and helps some people. It's part of going to the gym.   As for planet fatness, it's a judgement free zone, but there's a lunk alarm to judge me when I go to lift and drop some weights after my set, in order to prevent muscle damage.

1	I'm hitting this but I'm not the type to take it out on my teammates due to a force of habit that I have instilled to banish all negativity from my typing during ranked games. Instead I rage at myself every game for making mistakes, even though I know it's pointless.
1	Each team gets 15 minutes of the pause timer. Think of it like a basketball game where each team gets a certain amount of timeouts. Once they are out of timeouts, they can't stop the game no matter what the reason is.   In this situation, TBD's support player disconnected and could not reconnect within the 15 minutes allotted to each team. Velocity should not have to waste their pause time because of something that is wrong on TBD's side.   Granted, this type of situation would not happen in a LAN setting, but because it is an online tournament, there are rules that must be followed to ensure equal gameplay across each match.   Even though Velocity was behind significantly when Bubba DCed, they should not be forced to remake/forfeit because of a problem on the other team.   A good comparison would be soccer. If a player is found to be continually violating the rules, they get a red card and are forced to leave the game. This puts that player's team at a handicap. Even if that team is up 3-0, the losing team gets a chance to come back and wouldn't have to surrender. In this game, TBD used up 15 minutes of pause time (a rule set my the tournament), and their player was not back in time. To continue to pause the game would be a violation of the rule, and could be subject to an automatic forfeit (don't know the exact rules/punishments). Instead of forfeiting due to pause time, they started the game up handicapped, which Velocity has all the right to come back and try to win.
1	Jungle main here,   the mindset that I have when playing this game seriously is that even if the lanes go wrong, there must have been a time where i could have helped. don't worry about what your teammates need to improve on. worry about your own performance. record your games if possible and watch replays.
0	You imply that your job is difficult and only you can do it.  However it didn't exist previously and was created just for you  You refuse to describe what it is.  Sorry, but shuffling papers in a job created for you by someone you know / are related to isn't that impressive.   >> You should try it sometime   I put myself through a private engineering school earning a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering.  I paid my own way working full time and graduated without debt.  I've been an engineer for 16 years in the private sector where you must earn your way.  Jobs do not get created for you.   I work hard and I am damn good at what I do.
1	I don't know how to feel about this Zed nerf.   I mean it has the potential to open up the field more outplays since the shadow is now at a location apart from being right behind the target, but this also means that Zed won't get the old damage output that his ult combo originally had. In fact, I believe he would actually have to work desperately for his kill.   Essentially, this change not only how Zed function as a champion, but changes his entire play style as well. I believe Zed players will have to rework their mechanical skills to actually play him now.
0	As someone with sensitive skin, you have to be careful with them. About a year ago, the makes of them (Cottonelle?) must've changed the formula. My ass was always itching and felt almost like it was burning. Several tests (including a visit to the proctologist) turned up nothing. Cooling pads didn't help at all. I was pretty much at my wits' end. After about a month or so, I went back to my parents house for the weekend and didn't have any flushable wipes. After a week of trial and error, I found that when I didn't use the wipes, my ass would stop bothering me. The wipes had never bothered me before, so the only thing that I can think of is that the formula of the liquid part was changed.
1	There is also the issue of copyright stuff. If someone throws up an idea and Riot picks it up, there could be issues with that person claiming it was his idea and concept. There could be problems where people would sue for damages because Riot would basically steal his idea.   I'm not saying many people would do this, but if you noticed someone already complained when those pool party skins were releases, how one of his friends pitched that idea a year ago or whenever.   I think it was in that topic that someone said Riot doesn't take any ideas people on reddit or in their forums would pitch, but that doesn't exclude their actions, if they do decide to make similar skins in the future. Just because someone mentioned it before, doesn't stop them from making a similar one.

0	Brevity is the soul of wit."   Adviceanimals memes can trace their origin back to 4chan's "Advice Dog."  Most Advice Dog posts consisted of only four words.  The reason it became so popular and spawned so many similar gags is that they're a very accessible form of humor; most Advice Dogs contained two thoughts, separated by his head, and the humor came from connecting them.   It is a medium's nature to change over time.  Insanity wolf is a good example, with most Insanity Wolf memes spanning about 8 or 9 words.  And that's fine.  Aside from being a little wordier, they retained all the other characteristics: one thought, a picture of the meme's mascot to set the context of the joke (i.e., it's Insanity Wolf, so these shouldn't make sense logically), and a second thought, with the humor being derived from the link between the two thoughts in that context.   The reason that Confession Bear, Actual Advice Mallard, Unpopular Opinion Puffin, etc., are so widely reviled is less because they're wordier and more because they're more complex in general.  For example, Scumbag Steve is constructed:   Setup   Steve's picture for context   Why he's a scumbag   Confession bear is structured differently, usually as:   Setup, what I did   Confession bear for context   Why I feel bad about what I did.   Both of these memes get wordy, but Confession Bear is an inherently more complicated presentation.   That's  why people don't like the stereotypically "wordy" advice animals.  Advice animal memes were popular because they were simple and formulaic, and that formula created a feeling of an in-joke.  Other memes are as just wordy as the ones that get hated on, but aren't any more complex; they still work in the "Advice Animal Meme" concept.  The more complex memes, typically waterfowl and bears, are disliked because they don't work like other memes.
1	Has the "Loss Forgiven" been completely forgotten by Riot?   I had a friend playing a ranked game, and 9 of the players disconnected simultaneously. The one lone guy pushed down 3 towers before the opposing team returned. They then quickly killed the lone guy and pushed all the way back to win the game, all before the 20 minute mark. (To point out, my friend was in the winning team.)   Because of these circumstances I decide to look into if the losing team got "loss forgiven". But alas, they received a normal defeat, accompanied by a nice loss of ELO (thanks lolking.com for the info!).   Not five minutes later, Riot have posted a forum thread about the issue and put the notification in the launcher that the problem is already being worked on. Now correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't this Exactly what the "loss forgiven"-button was designed for? It's been ages since I saw it used now, and given the Major issues on EUW I'd really expect to see it more often.
1	I'm gonna hijack this post to post what i think about this, for most people, the problem is not that ahri does less or more damage, every one of the other popular champs also got a slap on the wrist.   The main problem is how much it changes her playstyle, and yes you may argue OH WELL NOW SHE'S HIGH SKILL CAP, that's not the problem the problem is that ahri is now a full on assassin, she wasn't, she was half mage half assassin (thanks to dfg >_> ).  Now even tho i don't mind the assassin playstyle, its not what ahri was, i personally will probably stop playing ahri, even if she's just as strong as before, simply because i don't find her playstyle that fun anymore, i was never an assassin player, and in this assassin meta, i pretty much played ahri and orianna exclusively mid because they were the only champs i felt good on that fit the meta.   now i hope the assassin meta gets destroyed because im pretty much left with only ori (a champ safe enough that even assassins can't own her in lane).
0	Did you miss what I said before? Obama had been bragging about how he had Al Qaeda virtually exterminated.  This was a lie.  Al Qaeda had actually spread all over the place, and they hit the consulate in Benghazi with over 120 armed gunmen in a coordinated attack, killed the ambassador, and then later hit a second site with troops and mortar shells.  This is a huge difference from an angry mob of protesters that gets carried away and pushes its way past the front gate.   Peaceful protesters that get carried away can not be predicted.  A recognizable long established terrorist network who have been flying their flag all over town, and promising to hit a series of targets, with the Americans on the list is predictable and preventable.  They promised to hit the Red Cross, the British, and then the Americans.  They hit the Red Cross as promised.  They hit the British as promised.  Did it take a genius to know who they were going to hit next?  Yet pleas for help were ignored for months.
1	I'm Platinum 1 with 98 points at the moment, if you are good with Twisted Fate you can play midlane. But he is definetly still good at the moment, most people just dont realize it, I really have passion for this champion and  his roams carry teams easily if used right.
0	Don't feel bad. I had an asshole driver pass me on the right side of the road once to get around me and go to the hospital. He barely squeezed past me without crashing and scared the shit out of me. The twist was that I was taking my mom to the ER as well. We both had to sit in the waiting room together and wait our respective turns--a good amount of time--except I got to the hospital without driving like a fucking animal.
0	OP is what my friends and I call a "baby killer".  Explanation: Had a buddy who's wife was pregnant with twins.  They were driving home one evening when she went into labor.  (around 32 weeks if I can remember correctly)  He of course turned around and sped off to the hospital.  On the way there a guy like OP decided he was driving too fast and blocked him in.  This continued for about 9 miles until my buddy begins to panic.  He attempts to pass him on the shoulder, and of course OP's brother swerves in front of him.  After several attempts and close calls my buddy is now REALLY panicking while his wife is screaming that the babies are coming.  Finally he just goes for it.  OP's brother swerves hard and sideswipes them.  My buddy scrapes on past and keeps going.  Suddenly he feels a severe vibration and his front tire blows.  OP's brother pulls over with him and approaches his car screaming and yelling to discover my buddy covered in blood and attempting to catch a baby while yelling at him to call 911.  OP's brother runs back to his car.  Does he call 911 or attempt to get help?  FUCK NO!  He speeds off.  Leaving my friend there to try to deliver his own babies on the side of the road.  ONLY 3 1/2 MILES FROM THE FUCKING HOSPITAL!  Eventually he managed to flag down a trucker who called for help which arrived just a few minutes later.  Baby #1 lived.  Baby #2 was not delivered in time and died from complications.
0	I see nothing wrong with what you did. If it's an emergency, you should call an ambulance, the police, the fire department. Anything else is not really an emergency  for the driver .   I had someone try to do the illegal passing thing to me yesterday while I was on my bicycle. It was raining, dark, and I had strobe lights and a headlight. Motherfucker still pulled into the  MARKED  bicycle lane to pass traffic. A bicycle lane that I was currently occupying. I managed to avoid getting hit, and when he had to slow down half a block later, I parked my bicycle directly in front of him and let the rest of traffic pass him.
0	i thought it was just one dude trying to act tough. and in all reality i was just upset about to get out of the car to fist fight? not smart i know, i just got caught up in the moment until i realized uhoh i might get beat to deffffff.
0	Every post involving an engagement ring has a dozen or so comments about how stupid and common diamonds are.   Why is the fact that diamonds are common even a talking point? People know they are common, there is a demand, so they begin to cost more, and more, and more. If people chose to get an engagement ring based on their birth stone (as is usually the "innovative" engagement ring revelation that is talked about) the cost of those (already expensive) gems would increase beyond the current cost of diamonds.   I know De Beers, blah blah blah. The fact is diamonds are common, hard, have good tenacity as compared to other gems and have a high dispersion of light, which makes them relatively pretty to look at.   Just because some girl picks a different piece of whatever to put on their engagement ring doesn't make them more creative/intelligent/progressive.
0	Waves of those thoughts have come over me off and on for a few years now. It's not that I don't have friends, loved ones, or even a partner (six years now, but I don't push for a ring. I think it's rude.)  It's normal to have those thoughts of being/dying alone and it is very easy to dwell on. Try not to. :) Just don't do what I did at 18 and latch to someone just to not feel alone. Remember your friends, especially the ones who are really there. Lovers and even friends come and go, but don't sell yourself out to another person for vain or material reasons. When it comes down to it you just never know how "the end" will come, where you may be, or who may[not] be there.  Sorry, not very good at this sort of thing.
1	well its kinda true, at some elos (even at gold and higher) there are always people that prefer farm and kills over objectives. whiiiiiiich caaaaaan f*ck up a game sometimes. I think its partly because the pros farm really well. they don't understand when the point switches from "just farming" to "taking tower/dragon before going back to farming". (not that I'm better at it. I sometimes go tunnelvision and sleep through an objective xD)
0	Oh they exist. I've meet plenty - I attended the most ultra liberal patriarchy-hating college I know of. Every day I'd see and hear things that made my jaw drop. Seriously, it was amazing. I sat in awe as a student presented a slideshow on why male sexuality was strictly one dimensional. I was told that I wasn't allowed to criticize the depiction of men in media because of my privilege. No I did not make that up - every cliche you can think of was uttered. The Onion has nothing on the shenanigans I witnessed.   So I know for a fact that these crazy self-labeled feminists exist because I traded barbs with them for over a year. And can you guess how this experience changed my beliefs about gender quality and femenism in general?   It didn't, because  letting radicals dictate your understanding of feminism is as stupid as letting conspiracy theorists dictate your understanding of politics.   Actually that's not strictly true. One thing did change - I lost any respect I might have had for the radical men's rights types who use their female counterparts to justify undermining the value of gender equality through the smoke-screen of removing the influence of radical feminism from our laws and institutions. When these people try to sell me on the idea that femenist ideologues are cackling as they conspire to strip away male rights, I have to laugh. The ones I met couldn't conspire their way out of a paper bag. Please, tell me again why such-and-such domestic violence law or divorce law is the product of this conspiracy and not merely an understandable vestige of a historical and cultural context that you seem determined to ignore. You know where I've heard nonsense like this before? From radical femenists! (I swear both these groups have so much in common with each other it's a wonder they haven't hate-fucked yet.)
0	Men and women should be paid equally.   Well then feminists should do some reading.  That 30% wage gap shrinks to less than 2% when you sort job by job and adjust for education, seniority, and hours worked.   Which hand you write with effects your earning power more than your gender.   > military opportunity   Except for the whole "if they were given fair tests, their numbers would drop lower than te current, abysmal, ~13%.   Or- or are feminists in favor of sending literally-unqualified women into situations where they can get, not only themselves killed, but there platoon killed?   > we cannot be drafted   Cute your source for where this goes beyond lip service.  I'll join that protest and sign that petition.  Though, the catch is that you'd have to prove that these were arbitrated by feminist organizations...   > the court system   The court system is, across the board, biased in favor of women.  For every 1 female inmate there are 15 male inmates.  For every 1 year a female inmate gets, her male counterpart gets 2 years- for the same crimes.   Also cite your source for feminists actually doing anything about it.  Because this is 100% an MRA issue and you guys fuckin hate each other.   > paid paternity leave   Mmhm.  These wants and beliefs end at the keyboard.  I want world hunger to end but it doesn't mean shit if I step over emaciated children in the street while I eat my sandwich.   > shamed for having lots of sex.   According to a TIL post yesterday, women slut shame, not men.  Who do feminists blame for slut shaming?  Who do they target with their anti-slut shaming campaigns?
0	By your logic any class on any topic is biased and shouldn't change your opinion or grant someone insight into any given field.   I am pretty sure that if I took a class on Epicurian philosophy I would come out with a changed opinion on the subject regardless of my teacher's leanings. Are you saying that only the opinions of people who haven't studied a subject are valid?   Because that's dumb.
0	Women are less likely to take up manual labor jobs" is interesting point itself. Would you consider that an issue to be rectified? Are 50/50 gender distributions in coal mines, warehouses, and combat infantry ideal?   There's a lot of cognitive dissonance that comes into play on both sides when we have to discern whether gender rights movements are about striving for equality or simply acting as lobbying organizations to get more good stuff for whatever group they represent.   Unpopular opinion incoming: ultimately neither side likes to admit that actual equality is pretty unrealistic and nearly unnatural. The best society can hope to achieve is to give every individual equality of opportunity, but to what extent can we as a modern civilization dump resources into combating ancient gender dispositions and indeed biology itself? Until we can completely genetically engineer humanity into androgyny, the psychological and physiological differences between males and females will always make the purely ideological concept of "equality" a difficult one to tackle.
1	Fiora might be the best counterpick in the game to low-cc AP assassins like Diana, Akali, Fizz, Kassadin (just not leblanc). Also, like pantheon, when well played she's a huge kill threat throughout the lane phase to most normal mages that lack an quick binding spell (lissandra/lux/morgana/syndra are too fast, but zyra is manageable for example).   fiora is a classic case of a champion who isn't weak, but is incredibly niche. She's not going to be valuable to someone with a smaller champion pool, but once you have most of the champions and a good intuition on how to pick against the enemy team, you can have consistent success with this type of champion.   if you sit down with an intention to play 10 fiora games one night you're going to have a bad time, she's not a flexible champion.
0	What pisses me off about this SLUT is she has absolutely NO talent. The only reason she and her family are "Famous" is because she sucked a dick.(Sex Tape). Her father would probably be ashamed if he were alive to see the mess the family has become. She is nothing but a Talentless slut with an Obese ass.
0	2nd point is only relevant because of the 1st point.   If I owned a shop and declared all sales will contribute to helping the relief fund over there, yes I will get more people. If they asked me how much and I tell them 10%, I wouldn't be lying. I'm still making money from it, as well as garnering more attention to attract more potential buyers. Not to mention any long term customers.   The point is that point #2 only comes into play because of how little of a portion I'm willing to give.   >Good charities keep that percentage of dollar to donee really high. Bad charities don't and keep more of it for themselves whether by gross inefficiency or greed.   In effect she is a bad charity middle person. Yes, money does go to the target goal. Something less than 10% of sales. Why is this bad?   Using my shop example, because its not about the Philippines, its about getting more long term customers with warm and happy thoughts (about giving to charity) and when those warm and happy thoughted customers talk to others about my shop, they will have warm and happy words. What I'm saying is help the islands over there. What I'm doing is profiting. There's discontinuity that is happening.   What is she selling? Her image, her as a brand name. What shes doing is exploitive.   >How is that her fault? Any donation made by anyone follows the same process. International Medical Corps is in the same tier as the American Red Cross so unless you're getting your panties in a twist at those donating to Red Cross there is no argument here.   Its not, #2 was there to support point #1 on how little she actually giving as compared to what she is getting.   >You can argue that she has more money and should donate more or whatever. But to say she is doing less than nothing because the charity she is giving to is going to use some of that money on something other supplies is ridiculous. She's still donating 10% of the eBay sales. That's not nothing no matter how much you don't like her.   Its not that because she has more money she should donate more, its that she donated so little in order to make more money.   >Can you argue she should be doing more because of her financial situation? Sure, absolutely. But don't say it's nothing, she's donating money (probably more than you and I) to a cause that doesn't affect her. It might not be out of the goodness of her heart as much as publicity (which apparently backfired) but at the end of the day 10% of the sales are going to that charity and no one has been misled about that.   I didn't say anything about being misled. I didn't say it was nothing. You are saying that I did. In fact I think where you got that idea was...   >In this case, shes only promising 10%. Of that number it then goes to an actual charity that cuts the end purchase value to the donees to a much smaller number.
0	Agreed. Sometimes buying the most expensive is just paying for the brand, and less for the actual quality of the speakers. Performance products such as Bose and high quality Sony are exceptional, but if you purchase Beats by Dre, etc, you're wasting your money. I work as a sound engineer, and the specs for some $60 headphones match the highest quality Beats, retailing for $300. Look for the deals, look for the amplification quality and the frequency range. Honestly, most regular people won't be able to tell the difference in quality as long as the frequency response is relatively clean and they are well constructed. /rant
0	Receiving a sexually harassing joke from your boss and then getting fired for returning an equally harassing joke is grounds for a suit. As such, the boss is highly unlikely to fire you in the first place. That's beside the fact that the boss felt safe enough to joke with you about that at all, which sends a clear message about what he thinks is okay.
1	I definitely would have clicked smurf when I first started if I knew I would get xp/ip boosts for it.  Sure, I would lose most of the first few games, but my MMR would fall rapidly, and basically it would mean losing the first 10-15 games but gaining much more xp and ip than I would have otherwise.  I like getting currency in games (who doesn't?) and the option of getting more for just a couple losses is something that I would take every time.
0	Schuck and jive. It's not like I walked right into it. First, I taught overseas. Believe it or not, that's not a bad thing to have on your resume. Then when I came back, I got a job that wasn't super high paying, but that taught me some basic business and career skills.   While at that job, I took every chance I could to learn new things. I pushed for opportunities, and kept my ear to the ground about goings on there. I offered to help fill in and took leadership roles whenever I could. Finally, I landed a pretty decent desk job there. The pay still wasn't great, but I had a pretty good job title and experience to put on my resume.   All the while, I tried to go into officer training in the armed forces, applied at any and all companies I could, tried to get a job at my local university, etc. but my luck was not automatic. All the while my plan was "Keep looking for a job, but in the meantime keep doing all I can to work my way up at my current job. If I never find anything, at least I will have built a decent career for myself in the meantime."   Finally, I caught a break. I got an interview at a local oil and gas company. At this point, I had gone on several interviews and had really honed my interview skills. I ended up getting the job.   The time between returning home and getting that job was about 10 months. It was a bona fide "college grad" job, with a solid middle class wage, working with a lot of business grads.   Honestly though, that job sucked. Big time. It was monotonous and lacked any opportunity for creative or critical thinking. It was robot work. Nonetheless, I kept at it. I wasn't the best, but I held my own. I knew the company's internal transfer policy, and after my two years in that position, I transferred to my current job. I make about the same amount of money, but am a lot less stressed, and the nature of my work is completely different. I feel from here I'll have even more opportunities to learn and grow and move up in my career.   I think the mistake a lot of college grads make is that if they can't find a job right away, they go wait tables or work at Starbucks or something. That's basically thinking "My degree will be enough to find the right job." Well... how is Starbucks or waiting tables really furthering your career?   It's just as easy to get a job at a bank, credit union, office, or insurance agency or something like that. Hell even retail is better than food service. Put yourself in a position to develop a career or at least gain some marketable skills. Always look for ways to reach the next level.   Anyway, I know that's kind of long, but that's how it worked for me. Business majors had an easier time finding a job right out of college, but I lived overseas twice, speak 2 languages, and have done plenty of cool shit I wouldn't trade for a job right out of college.
0	To add onto some already good advice.  You probably want to be networking outside of campus.  A business frat isnt a terrible option, but who are you meeting - a bunch of people without jobs (other students).  I would recommend you start talking to friends and seeing if they have relatives in fields youre interested in.  Or your parents friends. Or your professors.  Don't be shy about using linkedin to find alums from your school that are in fields that interest you either.  Ask for informational interviews and just start talking about your goals and asking them about how they go to where they are today.  This can open so many doors, or at least make you aware of paths you arent already.  Talking to other students is going to put you into the same really crowded career pipes that everyone else is trying to take advantage of.  But someone with a couple years of experience in industry might have more unique ideas.  If you impress them/make a favorable impression it is possible they can put you in touch with people you want to know come hiring season.  The other thing to be careful of is "Business" is extremely vague.  Have some more clearly defined goals, something like "I really enjoyed courses x, y, and z...this has really made me interested in a career in corporate retail" or whatever.  Its hard to find a career path without passion.  I speak from experience on this.  Find what you want then work to get it.  Also this comes from someone who is 28 and still a student so take it for what its worth.
0	Seems to be split 50/50 lol   Also just as an addendum, I would like to point out how flawed our education system is as a whole. One of the most brilliant kids I ever knew was a kid in High School, but he had one huge thing going against him: he was hispanic. He grew up in a neighborhood with awful public middle schools and came into high school poorly equipped to handle the material. He still did great, which is a testament to him and his now going to community college. If this kid had had the same quality of middle school education I did and was equipped coming into high school the sky would have been the limit for him. It still is, it will just take longer due to the fact that our public education sucks and he was never provided the tools he needed to excel. Fucking brilliant kid though. What school you go to isnt indicative of how smart you are, there are tons of other factors.
0	Agreed. Maybe having this "murica" attitude leads to a high amount of motivation/determination/creativity in finding or inventing employment. "America" has never stood for the premise that no one can fail. Instead, I think this country's culture reinforces the idea that if you work hard and get creative, success is likely, though not guaranteed. Other countries may shift toward more "automatic" wealth at the cost of some individual ingenuity. Our way may be harsher, but it creates one hell of an inventive society, and a pretty successful one.
0	Engineer in his 40s here.  20 years after college, nobody cares what you studied or even, in most cases, that you completed a four year degree.   The first few years with a non-technical degree might yield lower earnings, but I have plenty of friends who are doing just fine after majoring in fields that weren't in high demand.   In a lot of cases, the found something tangential to their major and turned it into a career.  Theater major running a theater, chef becoming a concierge, English major editing textbooks, etc.
0	I feel like I should impart some wisdom to maybe my peers and to those in college now. Like you, I still look for that dream job that I want. However I can't stress enough that while college is still super important for learning how to think in different ways and problem solve. However that cliché line "Its not what you know, its who you know" well its true but its also "Its not what you know, its what you do".   Story time!   After doing an internship in D.C and graduating with a B.A in Political Science, I sought out an internship in a local congressional officer. I did this for two reasons: 1) Mostly to learn more about the politics at the local level and get some more real world experience. 2) I interned for a organization that plays a big role in finance....this was in 2008...I was graduating in the spring of 09...I knew I was in trouble.   So here I interned for close to a year, free internship, and getting to know the ropes of how a local congressional works and getting a good feel of my district. I lucked out and the congressman was also the same party I belonged to. Some time passes and I'm asked to help with a local campaign. It was only for a week or so (it was October) but I kind of gained insight on what you need to run a election. More time passes and my internship ends, but I am asked to help with the congressman's reelection campaign. So here I am knocking on doors (getting paid), and in general just getting tons of experience. He loses unfortunately and latter drops from politics for reasons I won't discuss. In any case, what I thought would be a ticket to some type of future, just dematerialized.   I was bummed, and despite my experiences they didn't seem to matter. No one was clamoring for the young guy who had experience. I went into the cycle of looking at postings, and then a few less, eventually just stopping altogether just because it would make me so depressed. Trying to get back to D.C somehow or maybe even just going in a different direction like teaching English in another country, anything to fill this void in my soul. I started working at a job I hated, none of my skills or experiences mattered, I felt like a failure, that I let myself, friends, and family down. Here I thought I would be making a nice salary at a job and having to worry about "golden handcuffs", instead I was worrying if I was going to get enough sleep after working late hours. I was like this for almost 2 years.   After deciding to start losing weight on the body I was neglecting (still fat, just less of me), I saw a e-mail for a small political party convention. Normally I looked at these with disdain. However I decided that I needed to take hold of my destiny, and with a governors election taking place, I thought now is my chance. So I went and was probably the only one under the age of 50, and towards the end of the event I approached the party chairman, told him about my past experiences and how I wanted to help. After hearing where I was from, it turned out that there was no candidate running for office. He asked me "would you like to run for office?", and I gave a most resounding "Umm...sure why not"   I will spare the details, as this is getting long, but for the next six months I   campaigned pretty much every day. On my days off, before work, I was determined to win this thing. Then came the big night I was working for, we started counting the votes and...I lost.   I wasn't too disappointed however, mostly because I had a panic attack/ stressed myself out a week earlier, so it was out of my system. We came close, closer then my party has in about 15 years. Most of all, thousands of people looked at me and said "That's the guy we want" All the thing I had done had lead up to this point. My degree, my experiences, the people I talked to, allowed me to do this. Most of all, people are asking me "When are you running again?" You see, it was me who got me to this point, that at the age of 27, just ran a competitive race, that has never been seen in my area. I also learned that it was me holding me back, that I allowed myself to doubt my abilities.   I suppose the message in all of this is: College is just another stepping stone, it's up to you if you move forward.
0	Probably going to get lost, but I believe that people have lost the idea of what is practical. Plenty of my friends have spent tens of thousands of dollars  pursuing degrees such as Anthropology, Music Theory with a focus on Trumpet Performance, Political Science, Theater Performance, and Philosophy. Now they're struggling to find careers in those fields. We are the "follow your dreams" generation. I took a practical route and pursued nursing. My friends thought I was crazy for being a male who is pursuing nursing. They made fun of me, but when I graduate with a Bachelors Degree in Nursing, I will be a nurse (not a philosopher or trumpeter). It takes hard work. I've gotten good grades, interned, gained relevant work experience (holding multiple jobs at the same time), and I've built my resume knowing that it will represent me in the job market. I currently have had a phone-interview for a position in another state (before graduation), but I've also talked employers in my state about a career. I think people need to really focus on not just what makes them happy, but also what is practical for the world they live in. Also, they need to look at career options they've never considered (I am one of them).  I am thankful that my career path is one that will make me personally happy, but is also more practical that the aforementioned degrees listed above. I know the economy is unstable and healthcare is changing, but I feel it was more wise to lean this way rather than my previous idea of going into the arts (painting, music, and illustration).
0	Usually check engine lights aren't that bad. When its solid it usually means that something isn't running properly; usually a sensor or something relatively inexpensive. When your check engine light is flashing, that's usually when something big has fucked up and you're in for a larger repair bill.
0	My CEL is because I put an FSZE in my Mazda Protege and I can't get the FSZE ECU just yet, my codes are weird and even though it is technically in safe mode, I'm still getting 30mpg+ and the torque curve is awesome.
1	The fact that abilities cost mana inherently gives you a cost/reward system. If you're sitting there spamming abilities, and the enemy dodges them, soon enough they will be rewarded for dodging your abilities when you no longer have mana for them. On the other side, if you land your abilities, it was a positive trade - you traded mana and they took damage (presumably you took less or even none, though this is only in the ideal case).
0	I live in Texas. I have two huskies. They both love the snow and freezing weather. They will both (one black, one white) go lie in the sun, by choice, when it's 105 out for hours. About the only way you can tell they care about the weather is that they get tired sooner on walks in the summer.
0	Rescue sites are always posting this on Facebook and everyone's all like "Who would DO that to an animal?! That's just cruel!!" As someone who grew up with huskies, this really irks me. I think it's really important to understand the difference between different breeds of dogs.   Someone called the Humane Society because, one time, my dad was out and the dog was outside (where he wanted to be). And it was -1 degree Celsius out. I'm not even exaggerating. I remember seeing people with light jackets on. And the Humane Society actually warned my dad that, next time the dog is left outside, they'd take him and put him down (I'm assuming because he was so old??) This REALLY scared me that the HUMANE SOCIETY didn't even understand the difference between huskies and...I don't know...maybe a chihuahua? (It wasn't even too cold for people!)   Eventually, my dad was able to meet up with an agent from the Humane Society who had actually spent time up north and had seen huskies in their natural habitat. He said the dog was fine, but just suggested having a place the dog could go for shelter (like a dog house (which was in the backyard, but the dog generally preferred the front) with a straw mat).
1	adcs are fine as they are in terms of damage, but there needs to be better defensive items for them. When it comes to late game you're either being destroyed by a mundo or one-shotted by an assassin. GA means they have time to reposition and doesn't always work, and banshees is nice but only mitigates the damage from an assassin. Besides, with both of these you can be chased out of a teamfights and it's always down to the bruisers/AP casters to win the fight. It comes to the point where if you don't have flash up you are as good as dead, and if you do you're still not able to do any damage.   Of course all of this can be fixed by solid peel from your team mates, but in soloq that just doesn't happen and I've had multiple games of going 17/3 or something like that, getting one shotted as my team is trying to chase the enemy adc and we lose. ADCs don't have the presence in fights any more and good positioning means less and less if a kat can flash>e>w>r instakill you no matter what. Of course adc's shouldn't be able to fight bruisers but there isn't much point if your sole job is to waste cooldowns and hopefully put a dent in a mundo.   But to reference your original post, 6 item cait can easily face a 4 item voli, she's the best kiter in the game. Work on stutter stepping and you should be fine. Alternatively, DON'T TRY TO 1v1 A VOLIBEAR. You should never be alone, the current meta means you'll be destroyed by pretty much anyone. Your job is to back up your team, not to 1v1 everyone. Armour pen wouldn't do much against a voli because he works off health with his passive, and buffing LW would be overpowered.
0	Nope, the whole charade is a waste of money incentivized by tax breaks. You get the two most insidious hell spawn ever birthed: church and state together in a holocaust of any actual meaning. Hell even the people you invite to your wedding are expected to buy stuff.
0	Guess what? Students that are selected for programs like GATE are already treated like they're going to cure cancer someday. I had 2 particularly awful teachers that treated me like I'm some kind of miscreant because they had no patience for the needs I had as a student that didn't understand the assignment.   Rather than try to get to the bottom of my problems as a student they put me on blast every time I didn't understand something. It's bad enough when your classmates treat you like you're mentally handicapped but to get that shit from an educator you're supposed to trust and go to.
0	Why does exceptional students even need extra resources? I ususally finished way ahead of most students in my class in highschool. Didn't need a teacher to come tell me what to do now because of that. I just asked for the next thing we were gonna work with, or if that wasn't possible (because we were gonna have some introduction or something) I just whent to the library and sat down to read about something that interested me, philosophy, biology, history, sociology or whatever tickled my fancy at the moment. Never really cared for math though, had classmates that did and they just whent ahead, and if they ran into a problem they asked the usual teacher about it. Unless you have a moron for a highschool math teacher he should be able to help with anything that a highschooler might wonder about, even if it is not in the area currently taught. Essentially, I knew how to read, look for and digest knowledge. Didn't need a bunch of fancy resources to do that then.
0	Can I just, say as someone who currently works as a special needs educator, that this is literally the most popular opinion that exists? Maybe people won't say they feel this way but most people obviously do. I mean, there just is no funding. When education budgets get cut, special needs funding is the first to go because apparently everyone agrees with you.   There are a million points I could make about how wrong this is, but I'll just stick with the money theme: it ends up costing society a lot more to care for individuals with developmental disabilities specifically because the education budget is so gutted. If more people cared about providing a decent education to this population many students would acquire more effective life skills and better integrate themselves into society. Because this isn't often the case, a student may end up never learning to toilet themselves or tie their own shoes having to rely on multiple staff funded by the state for their entire lives.
0	Sorry but I don't think you can compare them.  The educational systems in Nordic countries, from what I understand, cannot be compared with those in the US.  Here the system puts a major emphasis on the teachers and sees them as the first line.  From my limited knowledge, the education systems in Nordic countries cater towards the students.
0	You're right. I think a 50/50 split would the most fair, but let's be honest, the United States could not give less of a fuck about it's gifted and talented children. There were only 7.5 million dollars (the Michael K. Javitz fund I believe) set aside for G&T children at the federal level, and even that was scrapped when no child left behind was implemented. The problem (to me) is lumping all the two extremes of the spectrum together into "special needs", when they should certainly be separate entities. Also, the way NCLB is set up, schools practically have to ignore G&T kids and throw all the funding at kids with disabilities so that they don't fail the standards that NCLB sets for schools to secure their already meager funding. It also varies state by state. For example, my home state of New York is godawful about this, not mandating that students be serviced, or even identified as G&T.
0	As a high school student who has taken several AP, pre-AP, and other college level classes, I can honestly say that I won't be contributing to society in any major way, despite the fact that I'd like to do so. This isn't a laziness thing, as it's moreso a realism thing. Do I have potential to be a world leader? Perhaps (my ROTC instructor thinks I do anyway). But so does everybody else in this world. Now, when I say what I'm about to say does not mean that gifted kids should be entirely ignored. The "average" students need it the most really. You see, as one becomes successful at something, that constant ease of it all becomes mind-numbingly boring (I've experienced it first hand, as I quit my trap shooting team because of this). This is why the "gifted" kids tend to do terrible in college. They never really had to work hard or study like they pretty much require you to do in college. The regulars that may not have had record breaking test scores still do ok at the least because they know how to study and apply themselves. They're the ones who make it through college. They're the ones who actually know what to do with their knowledge. As one of the "gifted" that I've identified, I know I won't be that life-changing guy who found a cure for cancer or actually brought about world peace in world politics, but I'll still contribute if I can.
0	I'm NOT saying dump these kids into a barren basement for the school day. I'm also NOT saying that they should not be educated, nor am I saying that they should be isolated.   What I am saying is that I actually agree with OP - that funding for the bright kids should be more than the funding for children who need more support... with the caveat ... depending on the circumstance.
0	Thanks for posting this. While I understand from your point of view you are testing the waters and using it as a measuring stick for the relationship, on the receiving end it looks like emotional manipulation.   I grew up with only sisters. Punching one of them would have landed me in a world of punishment, but emotionally messing with them was subtle and equally effective. (i.e. buying candy for one and snubbing the other)   Once I reached dating age I had an arsenal of emotional manipulation, and by that point I didn't even realize I was doing it. It's hard to explain now, but I always felt like I was somehow the victim. That if they weren't doing what I wanted, they were trying to hurt me.   After years of failed relationships I finally understood what I was doing and why it was wrong.
0	Guess im driving you guys, I had the same problem, EXCEPT the girl i was with moved two years after we had been dating. It sucked mostly because it was late highschool and it was my Junior year when she moved, her parents forced her to go. My life literally fell apart, i lost my relationship with my family day by day and especially my brother, we were so close once. But my gf at the time tore us apart. I blame myself for that. Anyhow, a few weeks after the move, her parents brought her to see me for the weekend and we had fun.   Went out to the movies etc, and more intimate things as well. Weekend goes and she has to leave, this goes on for a while as my family situation deteriorates and i am actually going to therapists for mood swings and other crap. I used to talk to her everyday that i could. I lost many of my friends at school, ignored a few of my close girl friends and vehemently destroyed another who was wanting to help and actually date me at the time. This went on from the summer which she moved to half the school year. I didnt know if she was cheating on me etc. Her friends told me she was, i didnt know if they were lying or not. didnt care. I would still see her about twice a month for the weekends. The shitty part was if id ever tell her i wanted out, shed always pull me back somehow.   Eventually i woke up and went to a party for a friend i had made one night, it was her 17th birthday and i was 18 at the time. I went didnt really care about my gf at the time because i was sick of it by then. Met a girl there and she was having many of the same problems as i was, only not the moving and family issues. her bf was just no fun and sorta controlling. anyhow skipping forward i called my gf and broke up with her. Start dating the girl from the party and my ex calls and says shes pregnant. This caused a big rift in my family, luckily it wasnt true. Sadly it took me Five months after she moved to figure out i was happy without her. And in this time i destroyed everything i ever cared about and im 24 now. I am still paying for my mistake and im glad i left when i did, wish it was sooner, but i grew up fast. My brother and I talk much more now i have two baby boys and am still with the girl from the party.   damn that was long.
0	Just some advice for on old man...  (not that old, but a little old.) It's likely healthy to tell her she hurt you.  Because she did, and that sucks...  Here's the key word though, explore...  Back when my friends and I were in college, a friend of mine finally asked particular girl out. (we'll call him C)  She was his first girlfriend. (we'll call her D)  A week into dating he broke his leg.  A week later she left him for another friend of ours who had been aggressively courting her. (we'll call him F)   That was kind of a shitty thing for D to do to my friend C.  Especially since F was kind of an ass.  Most of our friend group was really pissed at D for a while.  Later, most forgave her too.  She tried dating C, it didn't work out as well as she thought it would with F.  That's life.  She wasn't under an obligation to continue dating C.  It was stupid to dump C for F, but people are allowed to be stupid in romance.  C never forgave D.  Years later he still holds a grudge against her.  And that kind of sucks since D isn't a bad person and is a friend of many of his friends.  But that's life.  I'm not sure what happened to F.
0	He's trying to say he's using a variable ratio schedule instead of continuous reinforcement ([terms]( which is more effective for altering behavior. However, he doesn't seem to be rewarding any particular behavior, so no 'opperant condition' is occurring. He's just randomly reading poetry to her because he thinks she won't appreciate it if he's doing it regularly.
0	So, for instance, if you quote directly from a reliable source about something in an active project, whoever has watchlisted it flashes the batsignal, calling other project members and tame admins, the properly cited direct quote from a reliable source will win over territorial meatpuppeting backed by admins in that project?  It won't then get taken to the dispute resolution noticeboard to be ignored for a few days before someone from the same project that was participating in the dispute purges the dispute from the dispute resolution noticeboard?  And when you bring all this up to admins the admins won't automatically assume that you're in the wrong, and, will confront you with actionable behavioral infractions and when you show them that what you were doing was saying "same to you" to the project members, what elicited a "you broke all these rules" to me, when admins find out that the instigator is in the "in crowd" suddenly breaking the rules gets a pass from the admins?
0	I grew up in San Jo as well. While working at the Costco on Senter rd., many customers came up to me and either asked me, a very obviously white guy, if I spoke Spanish, or they just rolled up to me, speaking Spanish as if I would answer them fluently.  It annoyed me then, and since I have been living in Seoul S. Korea for the last 4 years, I have little patience for people who move somewhere and resist even basic survival level in the language.  Now, if you move to another country, and just stay with your kind, and only speak your native tongue to the other foreigners with whom you share community, you will probably get by. However, you are basically shutting yourself out of the community. You are not providing anything to the culture, nor enriching yourself from it. I say this, having learned enough Korean to get by. Am I fluent, probably will never be. But I respect Korean people enough not to go up to them and say, "Do you speak English". Why? It just seems like it would be a big FUCK YOU to the country where I am living as a GUEST. I know Americans like this, who never leave the foreign district, and never learn the language, past maybe, "맥주 주세요", and I have no respect for them.
0	My take on the matter is this: there is very little American patriotism. Too often, all of the people I have met who do not speak English are extremely patriotic for their country of origin. My take on the matter is yes, bring your culture, and mix it into US. But leave your nation behind. If your nation is so great, why did you leave and come here? We are a nation of immigrants, yes. But we are also a nation of immigrants who left their country because it was not the vision they hoped. They came to this one to continue the American Dream.   I love foreign languages, and have already starting working on being fluent in German, French, Spanish, and Chinese. If I go to those countries, you damn well know I'm adding myself to their culture, not forcing them to adopt to mine. Unfortunately, now we have people living here who 1.) do not care about the betterment of America, 2.) do not even bother to learn the language of the people living here, but instead force others to learn their native language (which too many feel-good PC pseudo hippies are willing to comply with), 3.) cause (at least where I'm from) legal and social problems.   We have entire neighborhoods which are basically mini-replicas, some good (well-kept, nice, respected), and some bad (dirty, crime-ridden, unsafe)

0	coca cola made a commercial about how America was a mixing pot and all the different cultures we have here and some people threw a tiffey over it and want to at like America is a white culture with others just hear because we let them and it shouldn't be a point of pride. I saw the commercial when it aired and it was very confusing at what it was trying to sell and kinda weird but nothing offensive.
1	You clearly havent played Dota 2 on a high enough level. League snowballs because the Lanes in League are usually Duels, where in Dota 2 this is not the case. In duels if you get an advantage over your laning opponent, you imediately have the upper hand because every champion relies on items. This also isnt the case in Dota 2. You can have an offlaner Batrider for example with a blink dagger and be exremely effective, while the opponent offlaner can have for example power treads+vlads and still not be as effective as you.
0	So tell me, oh moral swami, how exactly should we stop it without killing most of the North Korean population? Funny enough, they don't seem interested in stopping just because we ask, and there are tons of North Korean soldiers (and civilians) you would liberate with death before you could ever liberate the country with an army. AND even if we DID go in an other throw the regimen, have you seen what has been going on in Afghanistan? How the situation is already devolving back into violence? How will we stop that from happening this time?   All your doing is bitching, which only helps when it raises awareness of an issue. ain't nobody unaware of the situation in NK, so you are really just wasting our time and blowing hot air
0	It will come out, often in cynism and sarcasm, sometimes even in anger and aggression or escapism like drinking or doing drugs. A friend of mine had this for a long time and got really depressed even though his life was good to him. Eventually he almost split up with his wife (with 2 kids) and it all bursted. They did, fortunately, decide to see someone, both together and seperate, and are working on it.  It's a long process, but he already feels lots better.
1	At some point, you just sort of run out of things to do. The purpose of summoner spells are to provide the most basic functions for stats.   e.g. ignite is basic damage/healing reduction, flash/ghost are basic mobility, barrier is basic shield, heal is basic heal, exhaust is basic cc, clarity is basic mana regen.   The only truly unique summoner spell -sort of- is Teleport. There's just a tremendous amount of pressure involved with creating a new spell that every champion in the game has access to that's simultaneously good enough to be a viable option for the majority of champions (god forbid something be niche) and not good enough to be incredibly broken. The amount that a good summoner spell would effect the game would be immense.   For example...   Summoner Spell - Freeze     Stuns opponents for 1 second     Sounds pretty basic, right? However, it would completely shift the meta and upset the balance of power. It'd be used on champs who suffer because they currently lack hard cc, and would be a massive buff. It would be godly on tons of champs who rely on hard-to-hit skill shots to open up their combo (Swain, for example). All in all, it'd be sort of a mess.   Tweaking the rarely used ones? First of all, I think there's a lot more diversity of summoner spells than you think. In the average game, it's perfectly common to have ghost and teleport on your top laner, smite and flash on your jungler, ignite and flash on your midlaner, barrier and flash on your ADC, and exhaust and flash on your support. It's not altogether too uncommon to see heal either, especially on things like Soraka. Cleanse is pretty common as well, especially if the adc has low mobility and is up against a high CC duo, like Jinx/Leona or Ashe/Zyra.   So, that leaves three summoner spells that are truly rarely seen.     Clairvoyance - This is probably the one you could make the most convincing case to be buffed, along with blue trinket. That said, if you really did need the temporary vision, you'd just go ahead and buy the blue trinket. A trinket slot is much less valuable than having flash is.     Clarity - This is a summoner spell that's just flawed in concept. By limiting it to champions that use mana and actually need mana, you instantly make it a niche pick at best. Because of its high CD and unreliability, it's not good enough to fix mana problems for any champions anyways, and it scales awfully if you end up buying an actual item to solve those mana problems. In the endgame, Clarity will be nigh useless. Ignite or Barrier, however, scale extremely well.     Revive - Stupid for obvious reasons. It's basically the summoner equivalent of Runic Blessing (or whatever that new shield defensive mastery is). It depends on you dying a decent amount to actually get value out of it. And, you know, dying in general isn't the right thing to do. The respawn timer won't come in handy all the time, and it's on an extraordinarily high cooldown, so you're basically using a summoner slot to provide potential utility and homeguards. MMMMno.
0	Yup. Stuck my dick in crazy once, clawed my way out before shit got too real. She wasn't openly crazy out of the gates, but there were enough minor red flags for me to see things heading south before she murdered my pets or anything too extreme. Still took  months  to fully get her out of my house/life/etc. I cringe when I read about people using the L word within a few weeks of meeting someone. What do you expect?
1	For me playing League has lately become more of a nuisance, while still having enjoyable moments. So to aid with my mindset I have started to do some rituals before every game. While in Loading Screen i get to do the things in need to prepare my game, i make sure to have water accessible (nothing fancy as softdrinks, while on the computer often you don't notice how much you're drinking/eating, so water is the healthiest[there was a time i drank about 1 litre of coke during a ranked]), then i do Push-ups, i started with 5 (i was really living unhealthy), now i am up to 80 on lon loading screens. To me it also helps opening a window from loading screen til first recall, fresh air helps you think faster. The rest are all small things: Is the seat the right height, are you hungry, are you exhausted from something.
1	Thats hundreds of dollars some of the bigger streamers/players would be sacrificing by not streaming. Zion who had a big week last week and was named MVP streamed immediately after LCS and got a huge audience turnout, at one point around 8k viewers. The Coke series is getting a big audience, larger than what Riot expected as Nick Allen said earlier in the week -- so viewership isnt struggling.   I dont think it's fair to ask these players to not stream and thus make money. When they have their big moment and get a lot of attention they need capitalize off it for financial reasons AND to continue growing their own player fan base. Yes they do earn a salary from Riot but its not as much as people seem to think it is, their biggest earning potential is from streaming revenues.
0	I never told my ex husband personal things that my best friends told me.  Girl code and they told me because I'm their BF not him.  And now we are divorced I'm especially glad I didn't tell him because God only knows what he would have done with the information. (He was pretty vindictive to me.)
0	The thing is, I don't really have any 'secrets'  per se  but I do have private thoughts/experiences that I would occasionally like to share with close friends, under the condition that they keep the information to themselves.   I had a difficult experience in my first year of university (suffered from really bad anxiety and depression) and I told my cousin/very close friend about it, simply because I  needed  to get it off my chest... later I found out that she blabbed all about it to her boyfriend (who I'd met in person ONCE). She betrayed my trust for the sake of telling a [not even that interesting] story.   I can understand sharing information/"secrets" with your SO if it is  relevant  to the both of you. But my mental health issues were none of my cousin's boyfriend's concern. Certain information really does not need to be shared. I needed a confidante, not a FOX news reporter.   Sorry for the wall of text... not necessarily directed at you personally... but I'm slightly bitter about this topic.
0	My husband and I had a huge nearly marriage ending blow-out once that was caused by that kind of situation.  I found a condom (still in the package) from our stash in the washing machine.  There was no reason for him to be using it outside of the house with me.  In general, we weren't really using them that often at the time, definitely not a birth control method we were using primarily enough for him to be carrying it around with him. So I got suspicious he was cheating. I checked the expiration date to match it to the remaining condoms in our drawer just to be certain that it was definitely one of ours, not just by coincidence the same kind.  It matched perfectly.   I counted the condoms and noticed it seemed there were significantly fewer in there than there should be.   We had a room mate at the time who was single.  It could have been likely he'd been in need unexpectedly and took them without mentioning it.  So I asked the room mate if he had taken any condoms out of our drawer.  It was absolutely no big deal if he had, but I totally had to know for sure if he took them.  He didn't know a thing about it.  I could tell he didn't know for real and was genuinely shocked that my ordinarily pretty damn awesome spouse (and his best friend) seemed to possibly be a cheater.   I got really pissed off and went to the bar for a few hours to clear my head and only became more certain and more angry. No one at the bar had a better explanation as to what might be up with the condoms. By the time I got home and confronted my husband and we were having a big ugly argument, my mother who had been visiting for the last couple of weeks was also back at the house.  We never fight in front of other people, but this fight was different.  This was divorce level deal breaker. It didn't matter who witnessed it.  And my mother knows better than to ever interfere with my marriage.  She knows to butt out.  But on this one, she kept feeling the need to step in and take his side.  Then I told her to stop meddling and started to kick her out of the house, and that's when she fessed up.  She was jumping in defending him because she knew he wasn't a cheat because she was the one who took the condoms.  She admitted that she had been sleeping with our room mate!  He confirmed that, and that he didn't know where the condoms came from, that she just had them.  Upon seeing the condom itself that was found in the laundry, he confirmed that he recognized the brand/style.  I nearly gave up almost a decade of happy marriage over a mix-up over someone sneaking some of my condoms.  Borrowing condoms without permission is serious business.   bold
1	As I told you, I mainly play him as an AP bruiser now, so I start with a bit of AP and magic penetration, and I find the damage/slow dealt by his E pretty good (probably not top-tier though).   Usually whenever I'm ganking with him, I'll let my MS buff charge for 1 sec before actually popping onto the lane. The main issue is, as you said: a good marksman will AA you so your shield goes off, but usually it's already too late and you're in range to land your E (which is honestly not hard to land). The slow is actually pretty good, and while pre-6 skarner's ganks are not really powerful, I often make the enemies burn a flash or 2, because the damage from his E/Q is rather good.
0	Loads of people are talking about the form for the exercises and how it's bad. I've had a personal trainer before and I've recently just started crossfit myself and the coaches at my gym are very persistent about form. You're required to do a 2 day intro session before you start any classes so they can run through the form you need for all the exercises properly and then before each class the coaches goes through the form for the WOD exercises again, even if there are no newbies in the class and they're also constantly correcting peoples form during the exercises too.   Getting a bad crossfit coach is just as bad as getting a bad personal trainer and neither job requires that you be educated in your field and even the educated ones aren't guaranteed to be good.
0	I've had a cyst rupture, and my appendix rupture (8 hr wait before surgery, then it ruptured, I collapsed, they rushed to open me up and had to carefully search for pockets of leaked puss -  I was 11 and it's a miracle I didn't get lockjaw).   My period is a very close 2nd to the cyst, normally. Sometimes feels like the appendix, aching down to my knees, up my back. I used to become anemic, diarrhea, nausea, claustrophobic, feels like a fever. So, so tired. Now I take iron and quietly shake and rock myself to sleep. If I can sleep. Can't go on BC because it messes with my system.  Sigh.  I was so proud to get my period when I had my first one. I was a woman! Yayyyy!!
0	This deserves a wonka meme along the lines of: "Oh a teenage boy wants to share his opinion on the effects of PMS? .. Please share with us your wisdom"
0	She felt totally guilty dating me(even though I had been her crush for about a year before we dated) and she blamed herself for my "pain" and the pain the other guy was feeling by not dating her. She said she knew she had more feelings for me than she did for him, but felt like she had no choice and chose to date neither of us.
0	I don't dislike memes so i'm still on AdviceAnimals.  I just don't get the hype of seeing other people see the characters in real life.  I like it when I see all the posts about people seeing Bill Nye because I would love to see him myself and it's cool to think he's out there in the public eye still.  When I see a post about OAG or BLB being seen publicly I just feel kind of like "okay, they're just people."  They aren't known for their anything they did and they don't really have any out of the ordinary talents that I am aware of beyond a normal person you would meet so idk why people get excited for other people to see them.
0	No, it's white-knighting if you defend said person unconditionally.  There's a de facto implication here that the girl is innocent and her father is a monster, e.g. the facts of why this slap occurred aren't even relevant because she has a vagina.   As someone who is routinely in the presence of a daughter who says things for which she deserves to be slapped by her father, I don't leap to conclusions like the rest of reddit.
0	Never said she shouldn't. People were downvoting because a spouse in this specific but fictional scenario we're discussing probably wouldn't leave her husband over this. Let me break the conversation down for you:     /u/N8theGr8 brings up the possible scenario where the victims actually stick up for the abuser. This is unfortunately common in these situations for a multitude of reasons.     /u/palindrome_is_not accidentally infers that the abusers wife would leave the abuser even though we were discussing the scenario in which it wouldn't make sense that she would do that because she is actually choosing to take the side of the abuser. /u/palindrome_is_not later edits his comment, explaining that he actually meant that the boyfriend would leave the girlfriend but used the word "divorce" because he forgot the meme said GF.
0	While I cannot comment on accuracy of your guess, as my evidence is purely anecdotal, I disagree. I am pro-life, but I believe it is an individual's right to choose what they do with their own body.   My girlfriend and I became pregnant with our first child three months into dating and half-way through college: we conceived literally the first and only time we did not use protection. We had no income, no house/apartment, and were amassing student debt. At the time, I was living off of my savings from having worked two jobs prior, and had an older car that I had purchased in high-school; suffice it to say that my savings were not enough for us to live off of. The only thing that we had in our favor was that we had discussed, prior to having sex, that we would not consider abortion an option - although I did tell her that I would support her decision (in the event she had a last minute change of heart). Today, we've been happily married for two years; our daughter is turning three soon. We also have a son who will be turning one. He decided to join us to show that appropriate use of condoms (no rips) and the pill (Erinn?) could still be beaten with some luck. My wife wanted me to add that she thinks the pill was influenced by some medication she took around the time of conception (despite the doctor assuring us it wouldn't). Our families have been extremely supportive, and we're doing well.   Of the two other women I know who were pro-life and became pregnant:   K was in her freshman year of college when she became pregnant; she was in a worse financial situation than we were (and with a bastard of an ex-bf who curtly informed her he didn't want anything to do with K or the baby). Without any real support, she had an abortion (claims that it came out as a soupy mess while she was in the tub). As a Catholic, it really hit her hard. Two years later, she ended up getting pregnant by her now-husband; her prior experience resulted in them keeping the baby. They're doing well and have two children.   M is also Catholic and is currently pregnant; she's a recovering addict with mental health issues who has been plagued by abusive boyfriends. Realistically, she cannot care for her child in any way/shape/form, and it's likely that without the support of her current boyfriend, the child would be put in protective services/adopted out. She's had a couple of late-term miscarriages and is intent on cleaning up her act (and relationships) to be a good mother. She's currently in the hospital undergoing voluntary rehab to ween herself off of her prescription medication (for mental health issues); the boyfriend is a recovered addict who has been sober for over a decade (and is fiercely anti-drug). He isn't financially stable, but seems emotionally ready as he's a widower (prior wife/child died in labor). As my wife is her best friend, she's trying to keep her emotionally stable; we hope it works out for them.   As I said earlier, these three examples are purely anecdotal: I listed them only to demonstrate that it is possible to be pro-life in a hard situation. I'm positive that I know women who have had abortions but have kept it a personal matter. In the end, I fully understand how  aggravating it is to watch people force their views upon others - especially when it contradicts that person's freedoms.
0	I can still remember the first time I experienced this exquisite feeling.  I had gotten Kirby's Dream Land for the original Game Boy.  I played that shit day in and day out for days until I finally got to the Rocky styled ring matchup with King DeDeDe; shit was real.   It was late at night when I finally got to him and I was having difficulty with him, I lost 3 times in a row and eventually was forced to shut it off and go to bed from my parents.  As you can imagine, it wasn't easy to get any sleep with that fucking puffer penguin on your mind.  All I could thing about was fighting him again, how to counter his moves.   I got up early the next morning after a restless night and immediately went at it again.  I was doing stupendous; dodging all his hammer slams, jumps and body slams; inhaling those stars like my ex girlfriend and spitting them out faster than a bulimic super model.  Continued this until it finally happened - knocked his ass out of the ring.  We're not talking about any WWF throwing over the ropes knocking out, we're talking about shooting his ass outta his motha f'n castle.  It was glorious.  I let out a magnificent roar of victory like grown up Simba after defeating his enemies and establishing his dominance as king.   Woke up the parents, didn't care, worth everything.  Fucking Kirby, Mario, Star Fox, James Bond, and Dash Rendar (Shadows of the Empire) were my childhood.
0	A bigger dick can feel nice - but I can't do everything that I want to do with it.  And often times it hurts.  I'd much rather have something smaller - and when I first hook up with a guy and I find that he is about average or a lil bit smaller I get soooo excited and turned on cause I know that I can be more crazy in bed w/ him.
1	they are probably out. kta won 2-0 vs prime and skt k and lost 2-0 to skt s.   skt s and skt split so skt s has more points than skt k IF they will win vs prime.   But since prime is a new team everyone expects them to get 2-0d. and they got stomped by skt k and kta.   sorry for my horrible english but i hope it was udnerstandable.
0	Honestly, I skimmed the link you sent me so this might be wrong. In the examples given in your link, the commas were there because they were in the original quotes. Such as: "blah blah, blah blah" can become "blah blah," said "blah blah." This makes sense because the commas were part of what was being quoted. However, in this case, the commas weren't part of the quotes, but rather were there to separate items in a list, the items being quotes, so because the commas weren't part of the quoted material, they should be outside the quotes.
0	The only reason they are mean to you is because they have horrible lives and want you to feel as miserable as they do.   I agree with the rest, but I'm gonna argue this one.   We receive collection calls at my home all the time. Well, collections and telemarketing, but the other bit isn't as important.   I don't know what company is calling. They won't tell me a goddamn thing, since they're not calling for me. I also have no goddamn idea how they got my home phone number since  I  don't even know what it is. Everybody in my home uses our cellphones, we only have a home phone because the bundle was cheaper. And every time they call, I politely ask them to update their records with the direct number for the person they're actually trying to get a hold of, so that they can not only stop waking me up a half hour before my alarm goes off, but actually get through.   After a good month or so of being woken up every morning a half hour before my alarm, I started simply picking the phone up, and then hanging it right up. This didn't seem to get through. So I started telling them not to call before at least 10AM. They again ignored it. Every thing I asked, requested, or tried to help them on was met with indifference because I wasn't who they were looking for.   So I just started answering the phone and cussing them out. First thing in the morning, I'm deficient of nicotine, caffeine and fucks to give, and these assholes are making the phone go off and waking me up.   Well what do you know, they stopped after about a week. And finally used the direct number I gave them.
0	Serious question.  Why do we need usernames and passwords if usernames cannot be used twice?  I don't see how typing "Apricot" then password "B4alf" is more secure the "ApricotB4alf"   Because, let's say, you're setting up a new Reddit account. You type in your choice... 'Justagreewithme'... but what's this? Username taken? Well, that's okay, since there's no password, I'll just type in 'justagreewithme' and that account is mine now.   Might not be much of a problem with recreational accounts, but if it's something you've spent money on?
0	That's so damn unfair. I'm sorry but it is. I'm literally just out of journalism school so I'm pretty idealistic, but come on. So any other industry is allowed to make money but god forbid news networks do? It's 2014 and CNN, Fox News and everyone else knows it. You can get your news and billion different ways. They have to compete with all these websites that can tailor make coverage to users. This story has a very mysterious appeal to it, which is not something that comes around that often. Ratings pretty directly reflect what people like/are drawn to. So god forbid they cover the stories that are gonna draw in viewers. Cause if they did that they'd be as bad as murderers, thieves, and rapists... I'm a sports reporter so I mostly watch ESPN, but it's hilarious because people complain about the exact same thing about that network on some of the sports subreddits. I swear almost every other "circlejerk" gets called out around here, but every time an anti-media circle jerk comes around, every single person is on board because everyone wants to sound "too smart to follow mainstream media." Sorry about the rant.
0	OP you are lucky that cop did his job correctly. My uncles wife is a sever alcoholic (who is now getting treatment) but we got a call last summer around 2 am from a polic station saying my uncle was in jail for abusing his wife. She had called the police after locking herself in a bathroom, hitting her own head repeatedly on a door until it was bleeding, and even tried to stab herself in the arm but it hurt too much so it was just a surface wound. The police arrested my uncle leaving his two little girls with their crazy drunk of a mother because they didn't listen to what my uncle was telling them or look through the previous reports filed against my aunt until we showed up at the station. The other side of my family is all police officers so I have a lot of respect for officers but this one drew a conclusion and my little cousins suffered because of it. My dad went to pick up my uncle and I raced over to the house to find the two girls crying in a closet alone and the mother missing until the next day when she turned up at a local bar.
0	I was in college at the time, but my father worked at home and at the office for a giant production company. He got a T1 line installed to our house to do simulations while at home (company paid for it). He needed it to size his reactors, distillation columns, heat exchangers, etc.
0	I had dial up until 2007. Yeah. I mean the new broadband was like 0.5mb and whenever there was a breeze strong enough to make a daisy shift it would crash,  but at least we could load a YouTube video without having to leave it sit for hours. Anyway, now I have fibre and my life's finally getting on track. My videos are loading, mp3s are downloading and I think my PC is starting to love me again.
1	It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.
1	I disconnected from a game 4 hours ago and haven't tried to get back on cause of the rage. For whatever reason I make it to champ select. Once its ready, I get the firewall error from Riot's end of tech.   I feel like most people wont get loss forgiveness because there are sooo many players have been dealing with this problem.
1	I'm sick of posts like this.  Yes, I think that the "League community" is hostile and unforgiving, but ragey posts like this don't solve the problem.  Nobody is looking for proof that you had a game with flamers/ragers.  If you want to be the thousandth person to complain about player toxicity then how about you make a more helpful post.  Offer some possible solutions to the problem instead of just unleashing your inner anger to Reddit.
1	The problem isn't really that rammus isn't in flavor right now, the problem is he is viable in very few team comps. As some one who have moved from jungle rammus to top, AP mid, and Support rammus (the last of which was significantly more viably than I ever dreamed it would be, but by no means actually viable) Rammus' ganks just don't have the power they used to since his taunt was nerfed, and he just doesn't have the ability to successfully jungle any more.
0	Late but oh my god! This is 100% accurate of my girlfriend's current roommate. This girl would kick my girlfriend out constantly (once at 8am), and then when I would be there? WHO SLAMS THE DOOR? every. single. time.   My girlfriend's group of friends had a dramatic falling out with this girl (no shit), so now it's incredibly awkward. I don't sleep there ever now, and my girlfriend avoids her own room like the plague.   I can't wait for next year, when I never have to fear seeing this horrible human being. And for when I hear that she has completely pissed off and alienated her new "friend" group.
0	Wikipedia's 'Cultural definition of the Western World':](   From a cultural and sociological approach the Western world is defined as including all cultures that are directly derived from and influenced by European cultures, i.e. western Europe (e.g. France, Ireland, United Kingdom)  [...]  eastern Europe (e.g. Russia,   Ukraine* , Belarus)  [...]  Together these countries constitute Western society.*     [Wikipedia's 'Political definition of the Western World':](   Countries of the Western world are generally considered to share certain fundamental political ideologies,  [...]  and therefore from modern political point of view   all European Union member states   from the Western, Central and Eastern Europe are considered part of the Western world.
1	I'm also plat, and the issue isn't so much her raw power but the risk and effort associated with using that power. The easiest way to deal with a Cait in the past was to just go in on her and blow her up but this has been made much harder now with the prevalence of heal and supports like Lulu and Morgana. I'm not saying that is like, "oh shit they got Cait gg" I'm saying playing against a Cait tends to be a miserable experience where you just have to accept getting your shit pushed in for the majority of laning. Mix in the solo queue factor on your lane partner and jungler and you might not be able to slow her roll.   You say that the Sivir would be able to solo her, yes, this is true if Cait stands there and tries to 1v1, but Cait has to tools to get away. The problem isn't her damage output but rather her ability to avoid yours.
1	Usually buffs are an aura or something around the hands and debuffs are easily spotted. Examples: Stun has the swirl, Silence has the speech bubble, slow has a yellow trail.   Exhaust used to look like a birdcage which I admit looked kinda weird but it was better than the new one.   When you're being buffed, ur either running away or engaging. Since you have that one goal, you don't need to focus on what's being thrown at you, because you're winning, you only gave the intention to stop or give up if the target is far away or you get bursted down.   When you're being debuffed, you need to see it so you can tell if you're going to kill, run , bait, kite, or die. If you can't see a debuff easily, its harder to run or fight. You need to see buffs and debufds clearly to see the outcome of a fight, chase, or disengage.
0	Not all teenagers are violent assholes!   Me & my friends play football (saccar) outside my house a lot. The ball is kicked off a fence, and there's other people nearby, so sometimes they'll want us to quieten down. Specifically, 3 guys. All around 40 years old in different houses.   Guy #1 usually comes out with a knife, threatening to call the police and he'll pop our ball if it goes anywhere near him. He swears at us and is just generally an asshole.   Guy #2 usually comes out and just asks us if we can quieten down or move somewhere else. He seems a little annoyed, but nice at the same time.   Guy #3 comes out shouting at us, threatening to kick all our asses if we don't get the hell out of there.   Guess which guy we normally listen to? Yep. Only #2.   With guy #1, we just end up hating him. Some of my friends try specifically to annoy him, and the only thing we do when he comes out is just keep playing or wait til he goes away.   With guy #2, we normally respect him and try to leave/be quieter. I mean some of my friends will still say stuff like "What a grumpy asshole!!", but most of us like him and listen to him.   With guy #3, we just laugh it off. A 40 year old guy is going to come out here and kick our asses? 1 vs 5? That's an empty threat if i ever heard one. We're going nowhere.
1	Top lane Kha'Zix plays similar to an assassin Rengar, although I don't know how effective it is after all the Q nerfs and the ult nerf. Full damage Xin Zhao works similarly damage-wise and with the fact they both have really safe engages with Rengar's jump and Xin Zhao's jump both being point and click, but Xin is much shorter range with his engage. You could try Talon top lane, it's really weak in lane but outside of lane it does pretty much the same thing as Rengar. Damage Lee Sin and Riven both also blow up squishies, but both of them don't have the reliable engages like Xin or Rengar. Akali is also really bursty and has a safe engage, but again her laning phase is pretty weak. Feel free to add me in game if you want, I love talking theorycraft and the like. IGN is UnheardMarksman.
0	Fun fact, the colonial leaders actually didn't want representation. They knew that the tiny amount of representation they would have gotten wouldn't be enough to actually change anything, but it would give them no reason to call the British government oppressive.
1	I dont get it, why cant riot just make khazix the way he were at the beginning? before all the nerfs, when you could midair w, and when w applied his passive. that was a good state for him, you couldnt just go in oneshot everyone adn get out, you had to wait for the right moment, go in, execute with q(that wasnt as powerfull back then), get our with a reset and do it again. If Riot nerfs him like this he will become useless and disapear from play, like urgot. After they nerfed his w and buffed his q he has been broken as shit, but now he will be garbage.
1	ALSO FUCK KASSADIN   The unkillable, unlimited flashes are ridiculous for soloq just get rid of the champion. Do what they did in Dota and atleast ban him from ranked, like Drow ranger. He has an easy laning phase with shield and deals insane amounts of damage and can then run away.   The champions isnt fun to play against. My last game I was carrying hard and he is an unkillable one shot machine.
0	i remember when i used to buy that nice marshmallow charmin tp that felt like i was massaging my asshole with a new quilt that your grandmother made. i thought it was a necessity. but then... i took 4 rolls of industrial grade tp from a port-o-let (don't judge me!) and they lasted me about 6 months. it must be some kind of mental gluttony suppression, because my shizer is bad. i mean really, really bad. no details needed. but i wrap my hand up about 5 times. wipe, fold, wipe, fold, wipe, toss. repeat once, and finished. that's 20 squares/dump and it still lasted this long. i think there's something to this.
0	An easy way to get out of it is you say you have traveled abroad in the last few months. Specifically, any third world country.   Personally I like to donate blood. But thanks to their stupid list, which was last updated in the early 1940's, I cannot. I was born and raised in India, never was exposed to malaria or TB (My mom had me tested ;). But seriously, I was tested negative for all the risks they have on their list. Yet, I am ineligible for giving blood.   So, now I am gaming the system. I go in for the free snacks. Because there is usually a few people in line, I can't go back the same way I entered the bus. So, I walk all the way, to the other end of the bus, pick up my snacks and walk out. One time they gave out free pizza coupons. Free lunch for me.
1	not at all, twitch is all about the surprise whereas when you play Vayne they will see you coming and thus retreat or deliberately choose to fight you: this is not a assassination but a fight.
0	I worked in sales for an AT&T "reseller" that, at the time, was called AT&T portables that did this shit.   This is how my training went:  "If you add a,b, and c to the customers contract you get a total of $20 extra.  Plus they're free for the first 30 days and even if they cancel them after that you get to keep the money!  Now a lot of customers are going to want to not have it in the first place so it's better just not to tell them about it because it has to be on there for 24 hrs to take effect.  Now, sign this paper absolving us of any liability and promising not to do exactly what I just told you to do."  wink, wink   I ended up getting fired after 3 months despite record sales because I wouldn't lie to customers about that shit.  My co-worker, who got hired the same day, got fired the same day because he did lie to customers about that shit.  Our location was in a nearby mall that I frequented.  After only another month the entire staff had been switched out, 4 more months and it happened again.
0	Yeah except the law is kinda unclear on that. It says in statute 83.53 that we have right of access (Florida) anytime we deem it an emergency (which rotting guy for a month apparently is an emergency) and storing property is covered in the 705 range but that's for abandoned property. It was my first death.   To clarify I didn't go to school  (going now) for this shit. I was a carpenter from age 12 to 24 then I worked retail for a bit. I got my GED at 21 and moved to Jax around 27ish. I started work for this woman because she needed someone to fill a void and I just happened to be her newest tenant and needed a job. I admit I knew very little about what I was doing at first but over the years I've picked up on it rather well and am still learning.   Hopefully after I finish college (Enrolled right before this mess happened) I'll be in a position to be something more than what I am now.
0	I had one last night. Requested two bottles of Schneider HopfenWeiss that cost £6.95 each. Staff opened and poured them into the correct glasses. Customer takes a sip and says "I don't want that, change it for a lager". Staff member refuses and they ask for the manager. I step in and tell them that we've provided exactly what they asked for and, as the product is not defective, we cannot exchange it simply because you don't want it any more. Queue abuse and being told that we have "really shitty customer service ". I still have to apologise.
1	A pretty similar experience was as cait vs a lee sin jungle who had randuins and a damage item. I e-ed and flashed and tried to trap and kite him but he kept killing me. Is there something specific to do that may help me?   In those situations, you're pretty much just dead. As an ADC, you are extermely squishy, and Lee Sin still pumps out a lot of damage with minimal damage items. He's also incredibly mobile. I try to stay a safe distance away from any Lee Sin I can see.   Wards are a big deal too. It's harder to get caught out if you have your area warded well. A lot of times this just means having the bot river bush warded, but if you are going quite aggressive on them (Consistently on their side of the river), you may also want a ward by dragon. This allows you to not only watch for them going dragon, but you can see a roam/gank coming down much earlier than just the bush, where you need to get out asap, and with some champs (Lee Sin's Q for example), it can already be too late if you are pushing hard. I'll buy my fair share of wards to help keep bot tri-bushes, and dragon lit up to keep surprises minimal.   Sometimes their whole team comp should dictate how aggressive you are in lane. (This sounds more like a laning phase problem, as other questions state you are in team fights, this one you did not). Do they have a mobile jungler? (Lee Sin, Xin Zhao, Jax, Wukong, etc) Do they have a mid that likes to roam? (Kassadin, LeBlanc, Twisted Fate), a Top laner with Teleport? I've seen a lot of ADC's pretty much tunnel vision onto their lane.   > Maphite question   Obviously in most cases, a tanks job is to piss off the opposing carries. Malphite even more than others, as he can be in your face instantly due to his ult, then stick to you with his slow. As stated by others, Ashe has fallen behind, having no true escape. Most other ADC's have some sort of dash (Grave's E, Lucian E, Cait E, Ezreal E, Corki W, Trist W, Id often add Vayne's E to this since it pushes one away)   You're team should help peel for you, but without an escape after his ult, you're prob just boned. ADC's dont live long when caught. IF his team can follow up his ult if it hits you, you're probably just dead.   > Team Fights   You just need to stay back as far as possible for now until you feel comfortable going in just a bit further. A lot of times you should just be attacking the safest target, unless your team got a solid initiation on an opposing carry. Most times this will mean attacking the tank. People will get mad, and they will get over it. You will hear a lot of "Dont focus tank" in a lot of different iterations, but damage on anyone is better than no damage cos you're dead. A good deal of tanks have a stun. If they get a stun on you in a team fight, just consider yourself dead if they get any sort of follow up.   The main point is, just stay as safe as possible. To me, the number 1 rule of ADC is DONT DIE! Number 2 is do damage. Number 2 SHOULD be automatically achieved if you are successfully following the first rule (And arent playing so passive that you are never in range)   Other's have stated to play Tristana. I quite agree with this. Id mix her in instead of Ashe. Her range is insane when you hit higher levels. Her escape is super far, AND her ult can push people away. Malphite ults you or Lee Q's you? Ult them away, then jump away if more space is needed. She does have a fairly weak laning phase, but her late game is pretty crazy. Cait is a good choice too, which you are obv playing. If you arent, try watching for when your passive headshot is up, and focus it at champs for big harass. With her range, it can be hard to hit her back. Just dont focus too hard and lose CS because of it.   Ezreal is incredibly safe too. His Q has great range, he's easy to CS with as you have autos and Q, and has one of the best ADC escapes with his E. You can even go super safe and run Iceborn Gauntlets on him instead of Trinity Force as IBC has the on hit slow, combined with Ez Q and E is infinite kiting as long as your Q is hitting.   >
1	actually Wind Wall is recognized to have very little counterplay even outside of 'bronzodia'. I suggest that unless you're actually going to contribute to the discussion of a well thought-out, well worded, and broadly researched discussion, i suggest you 'go play the game and stop posting here lol'
0	It's a form of bumping a thread back up to the top of a forum. Also, if more people are having a problem, it might highlight it and draw the attention of someone who can help. Also also, if you reply to a thread and then a solution is posted in a reply, you might get notified depending on how the forum is set up.
1	The whole POINT is that it takes no skill to completely fuck with these champs. You know what a balanced (sorta) high skill champ is? Vayne. Sure, if you're fed and REALLY mechanically skilled you can basically 1v3 lategame, but it actually takes being a really good player to get to that scenario. And you can still be bursted down if focused properly.   Lee Sin you just walk up to the enemy jungler at their red and firstblood them 80% of the time. You know what actually takes skill as Lee? Doing an inSec Q/Q+Ward/W+Kick and fucking their carry over. You know what the thing about that is, though? You don't even have to fucking do that cause you can just kill the carry in 2 secs if you land one Q on them even if you're going tank/bruiser.   LeBlanc was the same. Sure, if you can juke around and faker-outplay then you're a really good player. You know what sucked about pre-nerf LeBlanc? She can just fuck you from lvl 2 onwards with Q+W so that you can never do shit in lane, and then she just face-plants into the keyboard and kills you before you can even flash. High skill cap champs aren't meant to be brainless OP Freelo machines, they're  ACTUALLY SUPPOSED TO TAKE SKILL TO PLAY .   And what the fuck kind of argument is "so that high skill capped players can climb the ladder easier" <-- that? It's SUPPOSED to be hard to climb the ladder, because you're supposed to be GOOD to do it. If a champ gets nerfed doesn't that solve the division mobility better than anything else? Because a GOOD player will actually still know their shit with that champ, and the fucking trash is gonna be wondering why they can't faceroll you at lvl2 and find themselves 0/10 for some reason.
1	Result speak for itself? Fnatic beat C9.  C9 Beat fnatic.    Alliance beat worst tier dignitas(was worse than Millennium). Old gambit beat CLG,  TSM stomped Lemondog(2nd best EU team at the time).     EU and NA are no different. Put a league of all combined, and it will be throw city for each team each week.
1	I never understood this. People immigrate,  and anyone who thinks that a Chinese team or Korean can go to a different country and maintain the style they did in their homes is naive. Korean gaming is what it is because of the infrastructure in Korea. They have in house sister teams to scrim against constantly and play against the set Korean meta, when lmq did well with their usual Chinese aggression in NA it was fine. When people started to check them for it and they started faltering they switched to a more burst style of aggression instead.  They're adapting to where they are and becoming the best there, what difference does it make where they came from? Every country is a country of immigrants in one way or another.
1	One player leaving isn't a team breaking up. Gambit has pretty obviously relied on Alex Ich for a lot if they crumbled like they did when they lost. So I'll concede that Alex is an amazing player who would probably beat most NA mid laners with some good competition with XWX and maybe Bjergsen if he's on point. Alliance I will also give you, with the exception of the losing streak they have been an interesting team that shows flashes of unquestionable power, I hope they really get better with more time. This is their first split right? I hope they just keep growing. Fnatic though is still hit and miss. Yeah Good Fnatic would probably be considered better than most but as we saw last year at the battle of the Atlantic,  bad fnatic is not there.
1	Yeah, the talk about how every korean is a mechanical god is mostly just a meme based on comparing the best koreans with the best western teams, not the average koreans with average westerns.
1	Well I can't speak for koreans, but as a Belgian born in brussels, my mother tongue is french.   Since I live in belgium I had to learn dutch and I hated it for the simple fact that no one where I live speaks it and I would most likely never need it in my life.   Whereas we had a lot of reasons, especially with internet coming to everyone around 1995-2000, to learn english. It's simply impossible to have a stable conversation on internet with people from all around europe in italian/french/swedish/dutch/spanish/german/...   Somehow, english seemed to make sense.   I'm really glad I'm able to write it and argue with people over internet, even though I can't really speak it unless I unleash my inner renekton (the english accent is really hard :( )
1	There are plenty of AP tops. Sadly as a mid laner he isn't very good anymore. He doesn't have the ranged wave clear to compete with Ziggs, Orianna, Zerath, Syndra etc.   As a top however he still does the same thing as before, which is bully lane super freaking hard. But against the new kings of top Gragas and Lulu he has a much harder time bullying. Because they do more damage, and either have sustain or shields to deal with Kennen's harass.   He needs honestly more damage to be a mid laner, or more wave ranged wave clear to make a good utility mid. As a top laner I think he needs to scale better somehow. His early lane is great, his lvl 6-16 teamfight is great because of his ult. But late game the short stun isn't very good, his dmg falls of hard, and he is squishy (Also by late game the other team has finally remembered how Kennen works and doesn't stand in the ult.
1	You are mistaking. k0u acts like this because he is delusional. Players you mentioned don't act like this at all, and if they sometimes show their ego, they are able to back it up with real deeds. Contrary to k0u.   Young players act like they have won worlds, when in reality they have only challenger badge from rankeds. For less than year. And under any pressure they start to collapse. Team requires from you to change yourself? Fuck this team.   I understand that you can disagree and hate personalities of players you mentioned, but they don't act like a k0u. If teammates, coaches will ask them to do something, they will do it. Theay want to play and win. They will not say "my team was whining about ganking so I proceeded to feed during scrims and left team before main game". You can be cocky, you can be full of yourself, but thats different. No matter how cocky you are, real pro player, and all older players are real - thats why they play at highest level, will not simply abandon scrims, leave teams whenever smallest pressure or obstacle arises.
1	I love how reddit is agreeing with freeze, based on freeze's opinions. Both k0u and freeze are obviously completely opposed from each other and therefore completely biased. None of the stuff they say could even be close to the truth. Reddit like always, looks at stuff as if it was obviously someone's fault when most likely 90 percent of the shit that goes wrong in this world its both side's fault. I really hope some day people get that shit isn't just black and white.
1	This whole situation is brand new to me.  Can somebody give me the
1	Watching replays of a normal high-skill game, sure. But watching a replay where they're trolling out of control?     Mechanics: really can't be learned by watching at all, imo, except that you can learn "oh I can flash over that wall" or whatever. But beyond that, it's practice and natural ability.     Game knowledge: what game knowledge can I gain from a team that is playing to be "funny" rather than to win? Should I copy their Rengar, and and invade the enemy's base in the first minute? Should we copy their early-game strat of blowing their flashes for absolutely no reason? Sure, maybe they did some legit stuff in there too I could learn from— but how can I fucking tell what's a good idea and what's trolling?     matchup knowledge: again, when they're trolling, it's not that helpful. We actually went even with them for the first few minutes when they were running a normal botlane, but again, they were trolling, so I have NO IDEA whether that's meaningful. Did we have a better early game matchup, or were they just playing badly on purpose to make us think we were even? Were we actually playing on their level for a few minutes? I have no idea.
1	I'm only gold so I don't know how it works plat+) but I play a lot of blitzcrank support and I've been having a lot of success with him.  My tip is: You need to adapt to the playstyle of your adc. You can usually tell if he wants to get firstblood (often Lucian) or just farm for a while (often Vayne). If your adc is trying to go aggressive at early levels and you're hiding waaaayy back that makes it hard for him and can be very frustrating. If your adc doesn't follow up on your engages try to avoid them unless your jungler ganks since it will probably end up with you getting killed.  Personally, when my adc is playing poorly (not reacting) I often go full AP. That way when I land some spells on their adc all my team needs to do is get the last hit; if they don't that kill is mine.  Also: Don't try to 'force' engages. Try to wait for an opportunity, like when their carry is badly positioned. If the enemy is playing extremely defensive your adc should have no prolem farming so it won't be that annoying either.
1	It's a really good idea. As far as I can tell the Movement Speed that is stolen actually scales from your own base movement speed, so you wouldn't even need the enemy champion to be moving fast. This effectively gives you a 25% multiplicative bonus. However you instantly lose homeguard when you activate it as it deals damage as well. Unfortunately in this instance a 25% multiplicative bonus is not as strong as a 200% additive bonus.
1	Dom is justified in his initial defense of his teammate but the statements he makes after aren't. This incident along with voy's tweet yesterday has given me the impression that Curse is vastly overestimating its season. Their 4th place finish while decent can also be an effect of CLG relenting its playoff seeding during super week. And while curse undeniably had success in the last two super weeks going a combined 6-2 but the rest of their season is punctuated with 9 weeks of poor play and a paltry 7-13 record making the large part of the criticism warranted.
1	Thorin is "infamous" in that regard, but only because unless you are consuming his content, the only team you hear about him is when this kind of drama occurs. He actually does things other than get into verbal arguments with pros.   First off, his contribution to the scene goes beyond just "bashing" players/coaches/riot/etc. If you actually watch summoning insight he brings up EXTREMELY relevant topics reguarding all aspects of the scene, asks very specific questions to pros that not only delve into that pro's history as a player, but also their thoughts and feelings on the lol scene as it was, how its changed, and as it is now. Thorin may come off as somewhat rude or abrasive, but you can tell he is intellectual and I honestly think the professional scene benefits from his contributions. I've learned A LOT about competitive league of legends through watching summoning insight, including things such as strategy and teamwork that I can actually take and apply to my own play.   I'm not gonna lie and say Thorin never calls people out or has harsh opinions, but its not like he just goes around blatantly being a rude dick all of the time for no reason. He provides reasonings for his criticism and he generally has a pretty neutral/unbiased view on the scene. He doesn't let anybody get off easy or cater to his favorite players/teams.
1	Man, fabs, you've made a lot of ridiculous posts defending Thorin & his shitty show.   I understand that you like Thorin for some reason, but how can you deny what minos is saying? Thorin barely even plays the game, he is lower ranked than the average viewer of his show, which is just plain sad, and yet he talks to people like he understands the game better than anyone else. It's like watching someone who doesn't even play the game, harshly and constantly criticizing the professionals.   His sole purpose is to cause drama, because it's the only way he can stay relevant with his lack of knowledgeable content. It's about to bite him in the ass though because people are finally catching on - they're starting to realize that they need to boycott all of his content to get rid of him.
0	I love doing this to assholes. If they tailgate me, and if there is another driver on my right, I purposefully slow down just a bit. He or she flips tits all over the place and swears and what not. I just sit there and laugh because they don't learn that just driving safe will still get you to your destination.   This reminds me. There was the white truck that tailgated me for a bit. He drive fast around me probably flipping me the finger. A few minutes past and he probably a good mile or two ahead of me. Well here comes pay back bitch: he is at the stop light and turn lane. I drove within the speed limit and look, he didn't gain anything.   But wait, that's not it. This turn lane has two lanes and after the turn, you have to merge into one. Well, it turns out, I end up I front of him for two or more miles. I beat his ass.
0	As a P plater some of these comments frustrate me. "0mG people driving 5km under the speed limit in the left hand lane what a f@ck wit". So i've had my licence for going on 12 months now, and i don't consider myself a bad driver but i'm not blind to the truth and know i'm no Mark Skaife or Craig Lowndes and still have plenty of improving to do. And so i'll often sit in the left hand or middle lane a few km's under the limit to make sure i don't cop a fine and lose my ticket (because i'm told that with a P plate on police will pay special attention to me) and constantly people just get up my rear instead of overtaking me and when/if they do decide to overtake me they will most likely flip me off or give me a greasey look as they fly by 20km over the limit, i really don't understand how people are that impatient on the road to the point that they get annoyed at other drivers for not being idiots. Its like, do you not value your licence at all?
1	As an Ashe main, it's hard to play Ashe every game. You really have to know when to pick her as opposed to a safer hero like Caitlyn. If the other team has a lot of hard engagers or gap closers and your team doesn't have a front line then it's nearly impossible to do well as Ashe or a similar adc like Varus. In order to play Ashe, you need to know when it's okay to pick Ashe, otherwise you're probably going to end up feeding.   It takes quite a few games to know when it's okay and when it's not okay to play her. For example, I see Nocturne as being the most difficult to deal with pick against Ashe, even to the point where I will not pick her if they haven't locked in a jungler because I know that game would be significantly more difficult to come out on top. Other picks like Leona and Maokai make me wary to pick her, but a lot of the times I can pick her anyways because I hev confidence in my play. You really just have to know how to fit her into a team comp, and make sure she's not going to get owned by the other team. She very much so fills a niche role in the game, she has her insanely powerful strengths and her incredibly abusable weaknesses, and once you know how to manipulate those you end up with a great carry who is one of the best teamfighters in the game. Otherwise, some guy just wants to play Ashe regardless of team comps and gets demolished, blaming it on the hero being shit, not himself.
0	Anyone who runs their mouth about secrets to their spouse is not a good friend.  Period.  You're a bad friend, and you should feel bad about yourself.  What if your wife has a friend she trusts that much so that she can tell her anything?  What about that person's person that they trust with anything(do you trust them with your best friend's dirty laundry too?)  It's bullshit.  It's called gossip, and people have hated people who do it for ages.  They're the absolute worst sort, and everyone knows it.  Just because you're married doesn't make it okay to gossip with your wife about things held in confidence.   Does my lawyer get to talk about my case with his wife?  What about my doctor?  No?  Then people I tell a secret to had better not.
1	You can do it still. It fell out of favor because if you dont focus around evolved W the mana demand of khazix isnt that high. If you want to poke a lot with your evolved W it is amazing because it solves your mana issues early. The problem is that it takes a bit to ramp up, but it gives you way stronger mid to late game which is something I value over the earlier powerspike in soloq, because I am likely to get to more items where building a Muramana really helps. It gets me better executes and it is extremely cost efficient, which is something that is very important where I want to perform to my strongest with the limited gold pool i have as a jungler. Admittedly I play a fairly farmheavy jungle.
0	I think my favorite picture of my sister is when we left her unattended with a yogurt in her high chair seat. It was all over her face, in her frizzed out, Don King hair, her chubby arms and body, diaper, the high chair tray. Everywhere. She looked like a Jackson Pollock masterpiece. Of course she was messy, but I never thought of it as gross. Messes are going to happen, especially with children. My mom didn't think it was gross either, she just took pictures of my sister in her yogurt heaven, took her out and gave her a bath.   In fact, my mom encouraged us to get messy from time to time. We'd have a "mud" day in our back yard, when we'd get into our grungiest clothes once a week, and play in a dirt patch that grass wouldn't grow in, while my mom mixed in water so we could make pies, feel it squidge in between our toes…and then she'd hose us off, and we'd be clean and fit for indoors again.
1	In my opinion Seraph never got to play to his full potential because of how CLG plays their games. Seraph was always at a deficit from champ select, picking carry type champions in every role EXCEPT top lane.   Then it was usually CLG who would initiate a lane swap so doublelift/aphro was at the advantage while Seraph suffered the most.   I have been watching this guy in soloq through op.gg and I must say he's among he's really strong mechanically and decision making wise, but only if he's allowed to have a 1v1 lane and get ahead.   I appreciate the fact that in this meta top laners usually are deprived of getting ahead early due to all these lane swaps etc. but most teams accommodate and adjust their playstyle accordingly, CLG just seem to forget they have a top laner and just focus all their resources on getting doublelift/Link fed, which is fine as they are the carries but I think they overdo it.
1	I sincerely hate posts like this.   If you're getting genuinly upset from playing this game, stop. fucking. playing. The only thing keeping you here is you making excuses to not stop. You're making yourself feel bad by playing League, stop.   I've been playing League from late S2 and I have had moments where I wanted to make a reddit post like yours. Unlike you, however, whenever I got this urge, I quit playing League. I played some Skyrim or some CS:GO or some WoW but I stopped playing League for the whole day.   A lot of people will tell you to take breaks often when you're ranking up.  I do it differently, when I'm enjoying myself and I'm doing well, I play non-stop untill I get angry. Even if I won the game that made me angry. If you're enjoying yourself, keep playing. If you're getting agitated because of  A VIDEO GAME  then fucking stop. Turn off the League client, go play something else, watch a stream, go make dinner, take a shower, do anything that takes your mind off League.   Then the day after, come back and play League untill you get angry again. Rinse and repeat.
0	Someone can correct me with a reliable source if I am wrong. But FMLA doesn't include bereavement leave.   As quoted from the [Department of Labor's]( website:   > The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) provides an entitlement of up to 12 weeks of job-protected, unpaid leave during any 12-month period to eligible, covered employees for the following reasons: 1) birth and care of the eligible employee's child, or placement for adoption or foster care of a child with the employee; 2) care of an immediate family member (spouse, child, parent) who has a serious health condition; or 3) care of the employee's own serious health condition.   Death of immediate family is not something FMLA covers. I cannot find any federal law that states an employer is required to offer bereavement leave.   According to  this .  This Q & A page  that specifically talks about how bereavement is covered under OFLA and not FMLA.   As far as I know, Oregon is the only state that has any sort of laws regarding bereavement leave. California has tried to pass laws for it over the past several years if I am not mistaken, but they have failed or been vetoed.
0	Relevant rant: I had a supervisor that would make up BS excuses to keep us from using out time off and threaten our jobs if we did anything about it. my favorite instance was when i went to go take my final exam one quarter. Months before, I had requested the afternoon off and got it approved to leave at 2 so i could get to my exam on time. I emailed the office that morning to let me know if they needed anything done before 2, because i would be taking a test, "wish me luck!" I get a call from her saying that [insert company name here] does not condone taking time off for school because people would abuse it. now that she knows what i am doing with my time off, she is not only going to write me up if I leave that afternoon, but will deny any time off i request for school in perpetuity. "it is against policy to allow time off for educational pursuits." I asked her to show me the policy and she wrote me up for "disrespecting her authority". I called HR in tears, not from sadness, but from fury. I wanted to badly to tear her a new one, but i knew that would not get me anywhere. within 20 min, i got a formal verbal apology from the supervisor(written one came later), a call from an HR rep that in no uncertain terms said that my supervisor was literally making things up and that any time i am not wearing my badge, they did not care what i do. That supervisor was so bad, they fired her about 4 months later. In the mean time, i purposely took extra time off for school, an extra hour here and there, and put in the request line "studying for a test, wish me luck!" my coworkers were supportive and hated her too, so every time i had a test or quiz, there would be an office wide thread wishing me luck with her on the cc.  the most ridiculous part? They were paying my tuition.
1	separate each scenario with the number of OP champs remaining after the 4th ban:   (2)scenario A:if 5th ban is used for op champ-> 6th ban will be for the last op champ. else 5th is a troll ban and then 6th would also be a troll ban= both teams get 1 op champ. No clear advantage   (3)scenario B:if 5th ban is used on op champ, then the 6th ban would be a troll ban to leave 2 OP champs-> both team gets one. if the 5th ban is troll, the 6th ban will also be troll=1st pick team leaves 2 op champ open. No clear advantage.   (4)scenario C: if 5th ban is on OP champ then 6th ban will be troll-> 2nd pickteam gets 2 OP champs. if 5th ban is a troll, then 6th ban is on OP leaving with 3 OP champs again. 2nd pick team has Clear Advantage.
1	For anybody else thinking about doing it:   Things don't get better by pumping 00 buckshot shells into the roof of your roof.   They don't get worse either, there's just nothing. You can think 'that seems so much better' but you can't even comprehend nothing, you won't comprehend anything. There is no comprehension, nor can you take satisfaction, or joy, or any sort of positive emotion from that. Or any emotion at all.   It's just nothing.   There are many people, many places and many things in this world that will help you - and you shut all that away if you do something like this.   Oh and for anything thinking about transitioning: This is why you need to get therapy first. Cannot stress that enough.  Get therapy
0	While people probably won't see this, I'm a student going to a university that is one of the best public universities in the nation (and by some standards, world), and I'm doing okay considering my situation. I come from a middle class family, am white, and am not accumulating that much debt. I'm going for engineering so I should be able to pay it off.  However, thanks to scholarships (and ONE grant), I am pretty much not paying any tuition. My issue is that neither FAFSA nor my university care about medical debt. My mom had a fuck ton of health issues (heart attacks [yes, plural], a stroke, appendicitis, MRSA, a hole in her heart, triple bypass surgery, and stints) and has since only been off-on employed. My dad makes a decent amount of money, but due to the expenses of feeding a family of 4 (not including yours truly over at university), those medical expenses, mortgage, etc, I can't get much money from him to help me pay for living expenses. Overall, yes, it's expensive, but even with extenuating circumstances that my university does not care about, I'm not doing that bad.
1	I have never had a d/c where it wasn't riots fault, good news about this is when i dc i can just go surf the web. Don't QQ at players when it isn't there fault they are just trying to relax and play a game.
1	The OP is 100% correct and true, BUT when there is an obvious feeder/rager in the enemy team, don't not report them just because they're technically helping you. In a recent game I had a last pick Ali who took Revive and literally ONLY bought items to help him feed (maybe a bot, he said nothing).   Enemy LeBlanc: "lol honor for Ali"   NO. JUST NO. When someone is effing up the game that hard (mind you, their Ez was 9/0 and Ryze 6/0 by 20), they can go burn in ban hell. You don't FUCKING HONOR THEM.
1	Reading your comments on this thread and speaking from experience, I'd recommend 3 levels of play and expectation instead of your current 2. Also,  remember that you can only control your actions and reactions. If you get in an argument in all chat and get reported even though the other dick was the problem, you probably deserved it for being annoying and perpetuating the rage.   1) Ranked: I'm going to decide to stick to meta and play roles and champs I am comfortable with and I know my builds for. If someone feeds or rages, I can mute and report them while still trying to focus on my mechanics for this role (which based on your current rank is something you probably desperately need to do to get better).   2) Normals: I want to relax a bit and play a game where I don't have to play my main roll. I do this here because I can fail and it won't matter. Also, if there are trolls/bitches and I mute them, it won't really matter because I am learning a champ or role I'm not completely confident about and I'm kinda planning on losing. Here, of course, trying to win is still important, but again, you can focus on mechanics of the role or champ and ignore everything else.   3) ARAM: Fuck it, I'm going 100% attack speed Annie... or I might build regular, but who the fuck cares?
1	You are right and I do exactly the same but it shouldn't be the goal for the game. And I know there was a better time in season 2 were you could actually "coach/mentor" people and they would say like "oh thanks I didn't know that, gonna try that now" instead of "fck off I will feed even more if you don't shut up fat prick" when I told someone like ward top at 2:55 since 18/20 top lanes die from the simplest minute 3 gank when a jungler finishes his double buffs.   Even though I can't understand you don't know that thing after 2-3 thousand game I tell them as 90% of my top laners die to that (I am low diamond btw, high plat was even worse).  Sure I understand that people don't like getting told what to do but if you are in one of the highest ranks in the game and don't know the most basic things you kinda have to listen instead of rage. Sure its a bad system if you get matched with someone, imo no one should be that high with that kind of an attitude and not even basic game knowledge but its not there fault that they can get that high in this system so therefor I can't be mad at them making my game experience worse.   And someone "control their teammates" sounds kinda bad although it isn't. I get your idea but I can't understand that people immediately feel offended when you teach them some basic stuff they still don't know. I would understand that they feel embarrassed. Like it is not fun for me either to tell someone that high that kind of basic stuff, sure he should be embarrassed. But back when I learned the game and then "helped" others I felt thankful and said "thanks" if someone told me something I didn't know (if he says it in a kind way of cause).   It's true, ignoring everyone that says something mean and playing your 1v5 while all trolls shout at each other and starting to feed can be a solution to not break something in your room but it shouldn't be. I don't want this to be my goal to how to be abel to play the game. It is a shame i even have to think about how to make my game experience not worse. A game or a company in general should focus on making something "better" instead of "less worse". They are going in a completely wrong way as they are scared to do some serious stuff about those people. I know those people bring a lot of money but if they trade that for a worse game experience I am out.  Like why not giving chat restricted people some option like in hearthstone just with basic frames. Cause some chat restricted people still use those few chances of flaming instead of communicate with the team.
1	So I had three games, aram, normal, normal. My mmr isnt even bad, its around dia 5, I assume. And every game I got atleast 3 flamers.   First game was someone out of my team cursing about how good their aram team was, etc.   second game was against a toplane riven, who apperentaly wasnt friendly enough to do some funtalk on lane and instead called me "the shittiest crap player ever" and other things, even though she was 1/3 with the kill she stole from the kha gank.   Third game was with riven mirror top. Ours apperentaly never heard of of attack cancelling, calling the other one "pro" "hacker" and other stuff.
1	Your taking the game too negatively.  Even if you didn't have blatant feeders on your team, you can't expect to have 100% win rate.  Losses are losses, shrug them off and just use them as practice.   Enemy team super fed, winning every team fight, and you got raped in lane?  Time to practice catch-up farming in the jungle and whatever lane you can get while being safe, practice defensive warding so your carry can farm, practice defensive positioning knowing you may get 1-2 shot, etc.
1	What I described was a generic situation where something similar will occur probably one out of 5 games at least, one out of 3 on a bad day (and not every lane has to be feeding for that to happen either, it can easily happen even if a lane won, and sometimes even if 2 lanes won).  What you described was a random thing that happened to you one time.  I'm not going to argue with you when you can't even follow a conversation.
0	I had a jack russel, but the low energy model. That dog was wise and would just look right at you in your eyes and hold that stare.That dog was the smartest animal I've ever had. Could open any door to the house, eat food in the cabinet and close all doors on his way back because he know he wasn't supposed to be inside. After 3 years he was scheduled for his pride to be removed. The night before he was to go in he was walking weirdly inside (moved houses) he walked into the wall slowly. My mother held him all night against the wall untill he died at around 2 am. She said right before he did, he looked up at her who was comforting him- looked her in the eyes for the first time that evening- laid his head back down and let out a last full breath and closed his eyes. That was his final breath, he had died.   Mother told me she had sat there crying, with the familys beloved animal in the blanket in her arms.   The next day we had found poisonous mushrooms growing in the corner of the largely fenced in area- and determined he must of eaten them. And the physical effects he had the rest of that day was his body slowly shutting down.   Much much later on, I found it so ironic as he died the day before the operation-- joking lightly with myself as if he knew what we said, and the little bastard we loved said screw that! I'm out!  RIP Two-ey
1	The main reason those bots exist is the Refer a Friend system, and Riot has already stated that they will change it so people can no longer do it. Current system has unlimited invites, and gives rewards from IP, rune pages, RP, limited skins and such. The new system will limit invites to 5 people, and the rewards are 1000 per friend on lvl 10, at 3 friends you get a WW (I think it is Grey WW) skin and at 5 you get Medieval Twitch. Since the rewards are way smaller/easier, the bots will likely vanish. These changes should be in effect in less them a month, and this slight increase in bots are probably due to the scumbag exploiters trying to get a bit more out of the system.
1	theres a lot more toxicity in normals for me aswell, i switched over to play ranked or teambuilder which are to be fair surprisingly more enjoyable considering theres ( in my experience ) less destructive behaviour in rankeds and no pressure to fill certain roles in teambuilder
1	I agree, he is not balanced enough. His E is too good for too many things; I mean really? Of all his spells, it has the highest damage, is aoe, has a slow, does the untargetable thing, and just outclasses his Q and W by so much, and ofcouse, there is also the fact that you go from 20 sek cd to 8, making him impossible to gank and very hard to catch out, whilst not missing out on damage...   I really want Riot to switch his damage from E to Q, and add the lucian Q mechanic to Fizz Q (it just feels wrong to die from not getting hit)...
1	it was meant to be a fun mode and not be taken seriously, when people start try harding and playing the stuff that's broken to the point riot has to disable it from the game mode then the mode is no longer fun. but please, keep telling me that "that's called playing the bloody game and people do it in regular games as well so that's a stupid reason not to have it."
1	I get that Rito doesn't want to balance the game around URF, however I have one word to counter that argument: DON'T. It's a game mode strictly for fun and some children want to just play to win and complain that everyone is OP, what these babies don't get it that everyone IS supposed to be OP. Some of us want URF to return because we want try all of the possibilites all of the champions, summoner spells, items, etc.
1	Humans want the liberty to do w/e they want, if it's not available, its more desired. Thats the reason why guys are put in the friendzone, being available all the time takes the interest away.
0	They're called single-issue voters. Another example is when all they care about is gay marriage. It's a matter of focus, not reason or proportion or rationality.   Another example is republicans and libertarians. They'll say they hate welfare, but ignore the much bigger corporate welfare, unless it's Solyndra, etc.
0	I tend to do this, but it isn't a good way to live. I have ADHD, which leaves me unable to actually focus on the assignments until the very last minute, at which point hyperfocus seems to kick in.   You spend most of the time slowly building up your stress levels because you aren't able to make progress on the assignment, lose many hours of sleep by staying up "to do work" which is never done, and then even more time the night before pulling an all nighter to churn out an acceptable paper.
1	Ask your question on stackoverflow, i dont want to be an asshole, but i think your question have nothing related to LoL by itself.   It's about javascript development, ask it to a developers community/forum :/   If the html link was a parallax animation about a BWM car, would you ask this to a BWM drivers community ?   So, first thing you need to know with development : learn to search informations at the right place :)
1	To anyone saying this is a bug. It's not. Becoming untargetable literally is the same thing as dying for a brief moment.   If you ult someone as caitlyn and they die before the shot goes off, your ult is available again after a few seconds. Otherwise it would be extremely frustrating. If the shot has already been fired however, it does go on cooldown. The same counts with unvulnerabilities. This is, intended or not, a feature. it seperates the good from the great. If you have an invulnerability and you get targeted by a spell ( not a skillshot ), there's two outcomes. The good will simply use the ability, the great will wait untill the ability has been fired and then use the invuln., because of that it will go on cooldown.*
0	I've held onto this theory that the Church of Scientology is just a front for celebrities to "launder" their money, to get out of paying taxes. To clarify, what better way to avoid taxes then by "donating" millions of dollars to your church. How do we know that the church isn't funneling the money back to all of its rich members, even for a small fee? It's public knowledge that its members have to pay for every level of "enlightenment", so the money given to the church isn't really questioned. Also, take into account that the majority of its congregation are actors. Who better to portray the crazy antics and obsession?
1	I disagree. I Played about 180 warwick games in Diamond during this past season with a winrate of 70% so stating that he wasn't that strong before would be inaccurate. It's more that people didn't know how to build warwick to make him a success. Now considering the new smites and the fact that most of the junglers don't gank as often as before means that hitting level 6 without much threat is much easier. Now considering you can get a free ff+10 item for only 2.2k amps up your damage tremendously. You spike a lot sooner in terms of solo dmg.
1	Try reinstalling the client and just letting it sit for as long as it has to. If it keeps dropping to zero, go into options and select repair. I know how bad this issue is, I spent a day waiting for League to reinstall after getting my comp fixed recently, but it's definitely worth giving it the time.
1	Well it does have to deal with /r/leagueoflegends but yeah it was already on the front page before with his
1	nice promo... but nothing to be hyped about. as far as iam aware Diamond and Edward still need to fly back and fourth each week from Russia to Germany? right? so its safe to assume this team might aswell end up last place in the LCS. Alex pointed out how taxing the traveling was, same thing Genja said in his post retirement statement. I dont believe it will be any different for Diamond and Edward.
0	My younger sister just turned four, and we were all prepared for magical Christmas memories. Instead my sister built a barricade against her bedroom door and hid under her bed while screaming "GO AWAY I DON'T WANT CHRISTMAS!"   Eventually, my parents broke into the room and dragged her kicking and screaming out from under her bed and forced her to open her gifts as she sobbed. Yeah... it was pretty magical.
1	Hi I'm Neal aka SirDrinksAlot312 aka ManiacofOlympos. I am support main who doesnt play ranked. My rank is Bronze 1 for those who wonder but I havent played a ranked game since early Season 4. I play support or mid quite often.   I've been told I have a nice grasp of the game and a lot of game knowladge but I dont have the mechanics. My stream is mostly about fun games. If you want nice classic rock and me singing them so bad that would make the artists cry, you should tag along.   I try to teach the game to the best of my ability too with my limited mechanics and less limited knowledge. I stream every day at different times. I will brings some order to my chaotic streaming hours soon.
1	Hi i am SteveSter and i am a casual plat player who mains Katarina top aiming for Diamond or masters playing Katarina top.   My goal in life is to try my best and make people's day by making them smile or laugh. I am super friendly and will help anybody in anyway i can by talking to anybody with personal problems or help anyone who wants to get better at league. I play ranked and normal usually chilling with my friends.   I haven't been streaming often finding quite hard to stream when no one is watching but will be strongly motivated as more people come! When I do stream it is usually weekdays 11am - 6pm EST   One of my streams in a nutshell
0	You have this pressure from family and society to grow up,  graduate,  pay taxes,  and get married. Simply because that's what every else does. A lot of people get married without ever supporting themselves or living on their own.  They end up pledging their life to someone when they don't even know themselves,  because they couldn't tell the people around them NO.   Once they are in the marriage they realized they fucked up.  Usually they realize it before hand,  but with all the excitement, momentum,  and money involved you tell yourself it's just jitters. Everyone else will tell you that as well.   The day after your honeymoon all that is gone.  Everyone disappears.  Then the whole process repeats with you having children.  All of a sudden it's been 20 years and you have no idea what to do with your self with no kids around the house and a significant other you don't like.
0	Yeah, I'm certain its bullshit.  >Using her boyfriends' credit cards to buy porn subscriptions or buy Porn DVDs online and sometimes replacing movies he owned with them. In order to use this trick repeatedly, I had to switch up the porn fetishes. Luckily, no woman ever believes the "It's not mine/I've never seen that before!" line. This is probably the best thing you can do to break people up. Convincing her boyfriends she has STDs/STIs. One time I hinted that she had pubic lice after lacing her underwear with stuff that made her itch her crotch constantly. He left soon after that. I found that people don't usually bother to confirm if the person they're dating has an STD/STI, although a couple times they did. Luckily, those relationships didn't work out without any intervention from me. This works best during the first couple of weeks people are dating. You also need to be able to keep a straight face when hinting someone has a STD/STI.  One time when I was 12, I convinced a guy that she was an alcoholic. I took empty bottles from our condo's recycling bins and hid them in my room until I had a good amount. Then I pretended to take out the recycling when she wasn't around and told him she had "one of those nights" and that she's "trying her best", etc. To be honest, I was surprised this actually worked because there were so many holes in my plan, like him bringing up the bottles I was taking out that clearly didn't belong to her. One guy really hated smoking, so I got my friend to steal a pack from his dad for me. I lit them randomly throughout the week, and tossed them outside once the room smelled like smoke. Then I'd leave the window open and put a bottle of air freshener out. I left the rest of the pack in her purse for him to find. Like with porn, "those don't belong to me" didn't seem to be a viable excuse. They had a big fight over it and then broke up. She had a habit of folding her money in a certain way at the corners so I stole money from her purse and slipped the bills into her boyfriend's wallet. When he used them to pay for dinner, she flipped out. I was really grasping at straws for this relationship, so it wasn't my best work to be honest. I'd convince them that she was cheating on them. The fact that she had an affair while married to my father made it all the more realistic. This worked better when she hadn't already told them about how she cheated on my father. She once asked me if I told her boyfriend and I told her no, but that my father had called earlier and her now ex-boyfriend had picked up the phone. She didn't have the guts to call my father and ask him. She got jealous very easily, so I'd convince her that her boyfriends were cheating on her. This included hiring strippers/escorts online with their credit cards, or paying my friends' college-aged sisters to hit on them at bars. I accidentally hired the same girl twice over the course of a year and that's when she realized what I was up to. Then she snapped.   So we know he isn't young if he is doing this, like what little kid could do this. If he did this 5 years he was under 12. So he would have to be like 13. Furthermore, my parents were recently divorced and they asked where I wanted to go, I said my dads so I live there now. Not saying they blindly let you just say were, but you have influence meaning that he was not opposed to this during the divorce. This all means he started after the divorce, and think when he would be old enough to do these kinds of things, I think he probably would be able to when, at the earliest, he was 13.
0	Out of curiosity, did this sort of thing translate into your life? Like, do you manipulate people, or see ways to hurt others without being blamed for hurting them?
0	My parents also went through a nasty divorce when I was about the same age as you. Through the divorce my mother was nasty and took up the role of the villain, while my dad was just, well, bummed… I found out that my mom had cheated on him when a random dude showed up at the front door to tell my father what she had been up to (naturally I was tucked behind the corner listening to the whole explanation)   I had always been fonder of my dad than my mom, but now she was my number one enemy. My dad worked really hard to keep us all comfortable and happy, and here she was running off and ruining our family.   After the divorce I was cruel and rude to my mom, and supportive to my dad. Why wouldn't I be? She cheated, she was a bitch, and he was a cool dad who made all the money. But, I was unaware of the financial faults my dad had made, the fact that he lied to my mom about their finances for years, and that he ended up getting our house foreclosed on because he refused to sell year after year even though my mom pleaded with him to do so. My dad had put my mom under unbelievable stress, and I expected her to suck it up and sacrifice her sanity/happiness to keep my ideal family running smoothly. After allowing my anger to cool, and having honest conversations with my parents about what had happened I don’t hold anything against my mom for what happened.   I’m not saying what you did was wrong or unjustified, But I can’t help but think if I had reacted this stubbornly and never given my mom the chance to redeem herself after she cheated, that I would have lost a great parent and friend, and the idea of that makes me sick to my stomach. For this reason, I sincerely hope that your mom is the monster you make her out to be, and not just someone who was in a degrading relationship and made a rash decision.
0	none of those were due to a lack of belief in god?   > when a book that you think was inspired by the creator of the universe says to cut off people's heads you don't agree with   I don't know about the Koran, but these beheadings were not for "jihad" but they were limited for kings to rival nations....  It would be like asking for Bin Laden's head.  In non-war scenarios, the Bible condemns the actions as wrong.   Here are all references to beheadings     Judges 7:25 And they took two princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb ... and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon....  This was a wartime action.  The Midianites had an army threatening the Israelites.  The beheadings occurred after a rout.     1 Samuel 17:57 - And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, ... [he] brought ... the head of the Philistine in his hand.  Again... wartime action.   David had just slewed Goliath and saved the bloodshed that would have been spilled if the Philistines and Israelites battled.     2 Samuel 4:7-8 And they smote him, and slew him, and beheaded him, and took his head ... brought the head of Ishbosheth unto David....  "Ish-bosheth was assassinated in c 1005 B.C. by two of his own army-captains, Rechab and Baanah (2 Samuel 4:5), who expected a reward from David because of this. David, however, refused to give any commendation for high treason; he had both killers hanged with their hands and feet cut off. Ish-bosheth was buried in Abner's grave at Hebron."     2 Samuel 20:22 - And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and cast it out to Joab.  Wartime action.  Sheba was leading an army / revolution.     2 Kings 10:7-8 - [T]hey took the king's sons, and slew seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets, and sent him them to Jezreel. And there came a messenger, and told him, saying, They have brought the heads of the king's sons. And he said, Lay ye them in two heaps at the entering in of the gate until the morning.  This was genocide -> a grab for power by Jezreel... however it's condemned by the Bible -   "The prophet Hosea wrote in Hosea 1:4-5 that Israel was conquered by Assyria as a punishment allowed by God for the massacre of the Israelite dynasty of King Ahab carried out by Jehu at Jezreel."     Judith 13:2-11 - They were all overcharged with wine ... But Holofernes lay on his bed, fast asleep, being exceedingly drunk. ... Judith stood before the bed praying ... Strengthen me, O Lord God of Israel ... that I may bring to pass ... that it might be done by thee ... When she had said this, she ... loosed his sword ... And ... she took him by the hair of his head, and said: Strengthen me, O Lord ... And she struck twice upon his neck, and cut off his head ... And after a while she went out, and delivered the head of Holofernes to her maid, and bade her put it into her wallet.  wartime action - Holofernes' army was laying siege to Judith's city.  She posted the head on the wall of the city and the besieging army fled.
1	No "unplayable" problems. I use the windows client at my dad's house and mac client at my mom's house (mom's internet is a little worse, but there's seven people at dad's, so they're pretty even in terms of connection).   Loading times are easily 2-3x longer than on windows client, and there's still the couple second freeze upon death. My record was 7 seconds frozen on sion; I missed my whole passive :(   edit: I was reminded of the time I loaded in ten minutes late to my own custom game.
0	Ok.  So, while I totally get this, I think it's pretty unhealthy for women (and men) to react this way, both for themselves and for the partners involved.  Sometimes things don't work the way you want them to - guys get anxious, or drink too much, or think that morning wood is actually useful (for many men it's very difficult to cum if you're starting with morning wood), women get anxious, aren't in a good spot in their hormonal cycle (which does affect sexy times for some folks), etc etc.  If you blame your partner's lack of orgasm on 'not being attractive enough' you are misunderstanding a whole lot, creating negativity for yourself, and putting a ton of pressure on your partner, which oftentimes will only make things worse.   Communication and confidence are key here - if your partner is enjoying what you're doing, it's not you.  So communicate with them and ask what they want, but don't take it personally if they can't cum.  Sure, trying different things can help, but maybe he's too anxious now that it's taken 'so long', and your desperate attempt to switch positions or activities will only be distracting.  If you're unclear on where you are in that process,   ask them  .
0	Fellow bro here. Had a similar experience on two occasions. Neither had to do with being nervous but rather that I was getting out of a dry spell both times and had been furiously masturbating almost daily. In both situations the girls were obviously miffed but each in turn took it as a personal challenge rather than an insult. So I stopped baitin and then next time they got me off in a matter of minutes. Girls happy, me happy, orgasms all around.
1	Yeah, I'm just going to clear up some key things that you didn't. First off, the 3 man gank on bottom took both summoners away from WT and Lustboy, while Kiwi and CoreJJ still had both of their summoners. This is a huge advantage in the fight. On top of this, Gamsu helps clear the wave at the tower faster, and Kiwi preps a wave for CoreJJ, causing WT to lose a wave to his tower, letting CoreJJ get within 10cs (nothing WT could really do about this).   Getting to the actual match up now. Morg/Sivir vs Corki/Thresh is not in favor of Morg/Sivir. It depends on when the match up is, pre 6 is Morg/Sivir, after 6 it's Corki/Thresh. Being that WT/Lustboy had no summoners pre 6, and Cloud was spotted down bottom pre 6, means they can't go very aggressive, on top of all that, Sivir just isn't very good aggressive vs Thresh lantern and valkyrie (Morg binding being the only real way to lay down damage, but thresh can shield and pull with lantern).   Then the 2v2 fight happens, which WT played very badly (shouldn't have went back in when Lustboy got hooked). Even though it was split 1 for 1, Corki gets a kill off it, and more time in lane. This is an actual win for Dig bot lane at this point. At this point in the game, the lanes are even, and we are hitting lvl 6 (Dig's advantage).   It's at this point that TSM decides they want to play for late game, and starts just playing passive, so that Corki will have small amount of gold for the mid game. Another 2v2 in the bottom lane that TSM loses 1 for 0. 3 man gank following that to kill WT. A big thing people didn't really notice is that almost all of Dig's vision is on bottom, which TSM knows, and thus doesn't really gank bottom. However, Azir is hard to gank (and is losing the CS war anyway) and Dyrus was already behind, and thus hard to gank for as well (along with Rek'sai being hard to gank).
0	A man should learn to detect and watch that gleam of light which flashes across his mind from within, more than the lustre of the firmament of bards and sages. Yet he dismisses without notice his thought, because it is his. In every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts: they come back to us with a certain alienated majesty." - Ralph Waldo Emerson
1	I'm pretty sure the highest you can go is Plat 1. So I think your normal. It's just how it is. Challengers players max out at Plat 1 too, so yeah.
1	Of course he predicts CLG to win, the rivalry between C9 and TSM is pretty real. C9 used to be the topdog and want their spot back, so seeing TSM lose would obviously make them happy.   He knows as well as anyone that TSM is more likely to end the season #1 than CLG is, but hey, maybe this year is different, who knows.
0	Before you put the ring on, almost every girl was a potential mate. And talking to women who you wanted to  have sex with  date made you nervous. And it showed.   Once you put the ring on, the pressure was off. They stopped being potential mates and started being people. And now that you're not nervous, you come across as more confident, which is an attractive trait.
1	As a mid-high gold player (gold 2) I can confirm you are most definitely not even low gold level if you can't carry bronze. A low/mid silver level player can hard carry 60-70% of bronze games and thats enough to get out of bronze in a few days.
1	Usually plats and diamonds know whats going on, and if they pan the camera over you on the map and watch you while they're dead they can usually pick up on something you've done wrong.   When they pick up on this they can either correct the player by being nice or outright flaming, so thats why you hear about people thinking they're so good and flaming eachother.   It's not that they're all bastards it's the fact they can pick up on others mistakes really well.   I haven't really touched on why it's elo hell so gimme a sec.   For all the people (and to save you time):
1	I once played with an incredibly toxic Ahri player who flamed just about everyone on our team after we gave up first blood. Sadly, she did well that game but we still lost. Next game, I end up playing against her (it was a weird coincidence) and since I was the jungler, I made sure to camp mid until the person eventually tilted and we managed to win by picking them off with my ultimate (I was Rengar that game).
1	Well, this is what happens when you are toxic. You have to do things to convince them you have changed.   For example:   It's like when you were a kid. Your parents have rules about going places on a school night past a certain time say 8p.m. You sneak out at 12 to go to a party, and you get caught by your parents. You are now grounded for not following the rules. Would you really think that your parents would just let you hand out with your friends whenever now? You have to convince them you won't sneak out again.   You violated Riot's summoners code. You got punished. Prove you have changed.
1	Okay, This is a really long response but i started typing and just didnt stop so sorry for that.  But this whole situation has brought out some rather strong opinions and it looks like both sides there are people who are mentioning the same points but are getting downvoted/upvoted rather differently.   He's being downvoted not because of his opinion but because of presentation.  People seem to forget the importance and meaning behind words these days.   He's upset that these pseudo skins cost as much as they do.  He has every right to voice his opinion about this.  And they are overpriced- I agree with him.  I also agree with him they take very little effort to make.   But instead of simply stating these points (all legitimate concerns) he kinda goes too far by saying things like Riot is "robbing" us with these things.  That this is "obvious abuse."   Okay, first of all, I hope you can see that Riot is clearly robbing no one with these things.  Robbing is an actually serious accusation, with heavily negative connotations.  This is not really a case of hyperbole, but a case of just flat out accusatory tone of something that isn't true.  Robbing implies violence/threat of violence in order to steal.   Secondly, "obvious abuse" is kind of insulting anyone who actually likes this idea- and as you can see from these threads, there are people with different views who are legitimately interested in getting chromas, stating things like "190 RP per chroma is cheap af" as their opinion.   They don't like to think others think they have been swindled or they are making a stupid decision.  They want to pay a little extra to give lucian a blue coat.   People are not being swindled here.  They know EXACTLY what they are buying and they know the exact price they are buying it.   So in this case, the way he is choosing to present his point doesn't come across as "these skins are overpriced."  It comes across as it an attack on anyone who thinks they are worth what they are priced.  And he also implies/states that Riot is acting unethically by trying to make these sales.
0	This. My grandfather was not a great dad or good husband, but he wasn't a bad man. The type of guy you'd be blessed to have as a friend but wouldn't want marrying someone you loved.   At the end my parents did take care of him, paid to put him in a nice home (he needed 24-7 care), visited him once a week and checked to make sure he was taken care of.   This was also around the same time I was getting my shit together and spent a lot of time with him (visits, trips to the doctor, etc.). Made a huge difference at the end of his life.   Some people change at certain periods in their life and at the end many aren't the same person. Heck, sometimes they can't even remember the shitty things they have done, leaving them wondering why they are dying alone.   If you have the chance, spend as much time with elderly family members as you can. If they were only sort of an asshole, try and suck it up and let it slide. In the least you won't have any regrets.   Now if they abused, neglected, did some horrible things you just can't let go? Well, I guess fuck em then. Yet at least visit once a month so your conscience is clear.
0	You make a very good point. One I happen to agree with a great deal.   However, just because you don't let a venomous snake bite you doesn't mean that you hold a grudge against it.   I am not going to go into the details however I will tell you that I did not hate him. In many ways I felt sorry him and the life he had chosen for himself. I could see that his choices were a continuation of the choices his father (my grandfather) had made.   I also knew that any continued involvement in each-others lives would, by default, cause a higher level of pain and destruction than a lack of involvement would. I would also be at a much higher risk of continuing down the path that my father and his father had apparently set for me. I chose to break the cycle. It was not an easy choice for someone my age (or any age) to make.
0	Wow I've never watched them either due to conservative parents who determined that TV was satan's wonder window so there are  alot  of good older movies i haven't seen..... Like I recently watched Pulp Fiction. Holy. Shit. :D if anything your positive comment kinda makes me wanna watch one today on my break :)
1	Bard is one of my mains and I do not normal cast neither smart cast w/range indicators his E. I know sometimes you have to know when it is going to go, but most of the times i use it for scaping from or baiting the enemy, and I have to react fast.
1	This is why the Reddit hivemind is dumb. The comment is downvoted? Lol,
1	As another colorblind player, I feel your struggles. Though I don't understand why you're being so aggressive about this in the comments. I know it feels like it, but developers aren't purposely pushing us away by doing shit like this, they just don't realize what mistake they're making. The people in charge of Riot's colors are crazy TBH, I mean blue vs purple. Really? Anyways, yeah having the numbers available limits the inconvenience, but it'd still be nice for everyone to see the circle.
1	People are going to act like this is such an edgy comment when in reality its not at all.   Most teams would have to ditch most/all of their players to win worlds, you'd be delusional not to see it.  We've been getting decimated by the Eastern hemisphere, and you need to defeat them to win worlds.
1	I don't agree with your assessment. Friendly thrash talk is saying: "Yeah, we're gonna be too strong in lane and will totally kick team X' ass". Loco's thrash talk was about how fnatic was going to crash and burn because they're so bad all the teams were gonna walk all over them. And I actually think he partly meant it as a prediction. Saying a team is gonna "crash and burn" in a tournament isn't just saying that YOUR team is gonna kick their asses, it's saying ALL the teams are gonna kick their asses. And that's a bit past friendly thrash talk in my opinion.  edit:
1	People cry at everything, if the shoe was on the other foot and EU bombed out EU fans would cry and NA fans would be assholes about it. Fans are fucking dicks. Remember when NA was raggin on EU at not getting out of groups at worlds? Or when Alliance lost to Kabum? A bunch of assholes showed up and started gloating and shouting on the internet, and some EU fans wanted them to lay off and just blamed it on bad luck or Alliance/Fanatic tilting or NA getting lucky.
1	You forgot about the whole ggchronicle thing in S1.
1	OP is pretending that EU fans are so sensitive that they can't handle TSM trashtalking them.   What's actually happening is that TSM thrashtalked EU, it blew up in their face, so now EU is thrashtalking TSM back and TSM is crying about it. EU handled TSM thrashtalk just fine (nobody cried about TSM's "Fnatic will crash and burn" pre-MSI); it's TSM fans who are bitchy and whiny because they're getting some revenge thrashtalk.
1	Sure, because every OGN trashtalk video is presented as a prediction/analysis video or a normal interview. No, the OGN trashtalk video are very well known to exist for that only reason. Every players, teams and fans know it. The trashtalk is limited to those video only. When someone step out of that context and actually say something in a interview that comes out as overconfidence will get slammed for it. It seems like nobody remember DanDy saying that they won't lose a single game against a western team during s3 worlds. Was that in a OGN trashtalk video ? Nope ! Did he got slammed on by many fans for that sentence ? Yes definetly not only by westerns fans but also by Koreans fans. Trashtalk work when both person implicated know it's trashtalk not necessarily something they truly think. It's not something you do to a person without letting them reply right after. Eg: Mata and Imp trashtalking eachother during their video presenting their duo for s4 worlds final is alright trashtalking because the setting let each other respond to the trashtalk the other does.
1	sion post rework was a beast, i hopped on that the instant i saw the change because his stats were crazy and they've steadily nerfed him since(edit: his mana costs were so dam low kick minions for days shield for days ashe's mana costs somewhat similar now that Q drain is gone)   but to break it down lets say for starters out of 15 adcs, early she outclasses all but 4(3 of which have situational or scaling range; kog, trist, jinx) so up until level 9 she's got second best range and for anyone who plays bot lane they should know range &damage is a bully's friend.   before even getting into randomization probability and whether or not NOT critting is a good or bad thing think about this; her passive is basically a free +10% AA damage multiplier over every other adc's damage output from the start(bully)   her Q is wack, early first rank it's +20% AS and with full focus stacks it gives an additional 15% damage per hit(scaling to +40%AS and +35% dph max rank) my understanding of how AS stacks is fuzzy so i'll just take this as an early/simplistic lategame explanation; at level 1 her multipliers are so 1.1(passive) x1.15(focus bonus) x1.2(Q AS)=1.518 other champions who would start with their attack speed steroid first get at most 30% so you can call that a 1.3 multiplier on their damage so out the gates if ashe vs another adc both had 100 damage, ashe would effectively do 152~ and the challenger would do 130. Factor in ashe's range advantage and slow, it probably means you're taking more autos coming into the fight and leaving it.   Her volley is pretty standard stuff dealing comparable damage(100~110 rank 1) to other adcs primary harass ability with a slight edge for being least dodge able when aimed at face, also semi high range and high AOE   oh and i forgot frenzy +5% as per crit stacking to 3; so her optimal dps case is like 171 vs 130
1	Kinda my thoughts. I think she is in a good spot right now. All she can do is AA and that shouldn't get nerfed again. She has an Anivia level of movement and that should be a bit compensated with some extra damage. And TBH? She needs that to duel current top adc's. She needs it to compensate her lack of mobility and escapes. She's highly fragile against ganks and it's totally ok to give her the little "extra".   She has one of the slowest attackspeed from all adc's. (Her Animations are still slow but they improved it quite good I think!)   And don't forget people like Corkie do too have 10% additional dmg on their AA's and his is true dmg.
1	What about the Q, make it reduce armor or some sh*t ashe is so weak against the tank meta. I was playing against a maphite he was feeding and I was still just only tickling his booty. Rito PLS
0	At a horse show in Spain that was incredibly boring, I noticed that a small group of individuals that seemed way too into dressage would initiate all of the applause. They would clap, then the entire stadium would follow.   To pass the time, my brother and I started clapping at completely inane horse maneuvers, and to our surprise, the crowd bought it.   Grinning, the two of us, knowing nothing about horses, led thousands to applaud every standard left turn.   I had unlimited power literally in my hands. After the show ended I fell into a deep depression that I still suffer from today.
1	Pretty sure after 1600 games played (I'm assuming they are ranked or what's the point in mentioning them in a thread about solo ELO) he is right where he needs to be on the ELO scale. Which isn't a bad thing. I like to think of it as the different leagues in StarCraft 2. Silver players play other silver player, diamond vs other diamond, etc. Granted, you can't compare Blizzard's matchmaking system to Riot's, but with an ELO matchmaking system, people play with people of similar skill levels after 100-200 games. The problem comes from people who think they are better than they actually are. I don't just mean the complaining about "ELO hell". I more importantly mean that they start using "ELO hell" as an excuse for losing; therefore, stop trying to improve and just blame the system. If your team isn't buying wards, you don't have a jungler, not sending the whole team to dragon,  etc., the enemy team has just as much of a chance to have the same problems.
1	The first sentence is clearly true. The part about Elo hell being a myth - not so much.   If your 'true' Elo is 1800, then of course you're going to be able to carry your way out of the sub-1200 bracket. But what if your true Elo is, say 1350 or so? You certainly deserve to be matched with better players than you're getting in the sub-1200 bracket, but the skill difference isn't pronounced enough that you can simply take over every game you play to get out of that bracket. With the amount of variance inherent in a solo queue system that matches five strangers together based on individual rating from a team game, combined with the new-to-ranked players starting at 1200, someone who isn't significantly better than that general bracket but who still doesn't necessarily belong there will need to have a run of good luck to not have every winning streak offset by a run of leavers, feeders, and fresh 30s.   The problem is exacerbated by the double elo gain/loss at the beginning of your ranked career. I have no problem with the variance, and I accept that streaks happen. But I got my streak of leavers/feeders early on - i lost 6 of 7 games at one point. Then, I went on to win 9 of my next 11 - but whoops, unluckily for me, the double elo gain period ended right when my losing streak stopped (literally - the last loss was -45, and the first win of the 9 of 11 run was +21), so I  still  dropped 67 Elo despite being 10-8 in that stretch. The win-loss variance worked out, but the Elo difference sure as hell didn't.   Elo hell as a concept is most certainly overused as an excuse by idiots who don't know any better - but that doesn't mean it doesn't exist. Being matched up with three-digit Elo players at 1100 is just such a nightmare; true, 1300 isn't THAT much better in the grand scheme, but at least there you'll probably only have an 1100 as the worst player on your team, and the difference is night and day.
1	That's because a lot of people are all about having the most kb's, and don't think of it as a team game.  It's really popular in a lot of mission based FPS.  A lot of people are clouded that in order to win, they have to get the most kills, regardless of what the team actually needs (Medic, tank, support, etc).   I play Blitz a lot, just to solo towers, initiate and turn the tide, making it a 4v5.  I have a blast even though Blitz isn't going to get a lot of kills (if any at all).   Earlier I played a ranked game as blitz.  Someone "called" caitlyn, and someone else picked her.  A third person outside of these two, said "wow what a douche, I'm going to troll now so you lose".  Selected Karthas, picked revive and ghost, and then said he was going AD.  I was playing with a friend (who was Lux), and we dominated the other team.  The three quarreled about not giving so and so Caitlyn, but then asked why they all were so hung up on a bad dps, and not actually contributing to the team and selecting a tank they said "you are 4/3(/8)" Blitz, you have no room to talk.  This is why.  They assume because my actual killing blows wasn't high (when as a team, we had 14 kills), that I had made it possible to fight.
0	Once upon a time xNotch got lonely because his creations only did what he told them to so he decided to give sheep the freedom and creativity to mine and craft things on their own. The one catch was telling them to never assemble obsidian in a doorshaped pattern. When the sheep started derp-facing around in the Nether a sad xNotch keeps the server up but nerfs gardening and never logs on again. @jeb logs on briefly several millenia later but doesn't announce anything particularly important besides "believe in me". Though @jeb did do some cool holiday patch stuff that included turning coal into diamonds and storytime to the flock gathered around the lava fountain one night.
1	Because Riot gives off the impression of having lots and lots of talented design oriented employees but not nearly enough talent working on the engine and client.   Riot pushes out new champions and skins at an astounding rate, but new features and UI improvements (have they even fixed champion portraits not updating health in game yet?) take AGES, and the usual response is "we're very excited about these new features we're working on, stay tuned...".   I don't exactly buy the argument that skins and champions are Riot's sole source of income therefore that's where they're spending all of their time on.  They know that DotA2 is going to come out eventually, and that it's probably going to be extremely polished because it's Valve.  In addition "notable" players like Hotshot talk about the need for better features quite often, and they have a pretty big audience.  The potential loss from players moving to DotA2 and new players hearing about all of the problems from streamers is probably more than the revenue they're making by releasing skins and champions in the short term.   So either I'm completely wrong from a business viewpoint (entirely possible) or Riot knows what's up.  And if Riot knows then they're planning something big or understaffed for what they need to be doing.  Given their track record on promised features I'll go with the second possibility.   Sorry, that was more off-topic and rant-y than I had anticipated, but Riot needs to get their shit together.
1	Honestly, I wouldn't worry about your situation for now. If you've already submitted a ticket to Riot, just wait. My first time that I sent one in, it was replied to within two days. Riot has one of the best customer supports of any game, they just take time to reply. I'm fairly certain that Riot would refund you for your runes, and probably won't take your RP as compensation. All you need to do is wait, and check on your ticket periodically. I'm sure they'll be able to satisfactorily help you.
1	I have to say, this has happened to me at least 6 times before (in the reverse of the OPs post, IE that I join they try and force me on mumble, I go on, they are terrible at the game, I comment, they try and blame me.)   I now, after 3 straight feeding teams, refuse to go onto mumble. The reddit guys while fun in chat, are god awful in game. 90% of the time someone is below 30 with like less than a week of the game played and then we get dominated. Or they have no concept of map awareness, when to push, when to do certain elements of the game etc.   If you tell me I have to use mumble, I leave now, its not worth my time to play with 4 complete noobs.
1	Please do us all a favor and leave the channel and don't come back. If you play in the reddit channel and refuse to use mumble just leave. You will make it easier on the rest of us and will leave room for people who actually want to play together. The room hits the 200 person limit every night now.
1	I personally thought your post was pretty informative, but I disagree with your opinion on annie.  Her AP ratio's are terrible.  The only way you can really capitalize on them is if you get mejai's because she can rack up kills pretty easily due to her fantastic mid game. Late game she peters off hard and mainly benefits from magic pen due to the high base damage on her combo.   Usually Annie's do actually build pretty tanky/supporty.  I see a lot of Annie's get Will of the Ancients/rylai's to provide more utility to the team.  Sure she could build straight AP, but her entire spell combo only scales 1.9 off AP (including her ulti).  Compare that to veigar who's spell combo scales 2.8 off AP.   Although someone like veigar pretty much does always build straight ap, with very little emphasis on support.
1	Now I've read most of the points in this thread...  and I've played HoN before I played LoL...   TBH it's been along time since I played HoN, but I do still follow some of the higher lvl of gameplay.   so I just gonna spread my thoughts and go over your cons:   1) I think runes brings alot to the game, can change your play style alot, depending on your runes and masteries. So two ppl can play the same champ, and use em diff early game, coz of the runes and masteries, where HoN you are locked to A champ with the same stats every single time. Yeah its hell getting the IP for the runes and champs, but LoL needs some way of making money.   2) looking at high lvl play: HoN got rune control, LoL got buff control, you will often see a lvl 1 team fight, to ensure your own buffs, or make sure the other teams jungler don't get theirs. how you play the laning phase in LoL compaired to HoN. HoN is prop more about ganking, where LoL is more about lane control. Their is "denis" in LoL, its just much harder to do, with much bigger risk. If you can push the other team out of XP range, will normely mean you are in position to get ganked, and with a jungler allways missing, you have to play carefull, or you are pretty muched dead. (I take the last point of argument 4 in here) LoL got a free blue pill back to base, HoN got a bird flying around delivering your iteams to you so you never have to leave the lane, you can buy the summoner spell teleport in HoN, with I belive 30 sec CD? can't rember. so this mean in HoN every single person on the team got a teleport on em, so much less risk of losing a tower if you have all 5 ppl pushing one tower. So maybe you have a free tp to base, but you wont see 5 tp in any team in LoL...   3) Hmm.. Their will allways be an optimal build for every champ, depending on the team you are fighting agaist. but then again, there are many champs in LoL their can be build, ap ad as or hybrid. depeding on your own play style. Let's take Teemo as an exp. You can see this champ in 3 diff games, with 3 completly diff builds, and works fine either way.  what I don't like about HoN on this point talking about casters. They got a fixed stat on the amount of dmg they can do with their spells. witch means that late game, the dmg out put on a caster in HoN pretty much dosen't mather, casters are early game dmg, and CC. In LoL a caster can carry the team, and have high dmg in the end game to.   4) Not hardcore enought? Hmm... as you say that is an opinion. I think that LoL is more competetiv than HoN. My reason for this is, that LoL is much more team based, yes you can see a fed carry kill allmost a whole team, both you won't see a fed carry do this alone. I've seen replays of HoN where a fed carry can pretty much solo a whole team.   5) (yes I know you got no 5th point, but I haven't talked about gold lose on death)  This is something I really hated about HoN when I started out, i was a Noob and wassen't sure what I was doing, so I died alot = I had no gold to spend on anything. LoL is much more friendly to newer players.  and this also aloves you to go for a kill that you might not get, without thinking... "Can I take this risk, I don't wanna lose my gold" = more action.
0	Actually, Ed Milliband is arguably the biggest scumbag on this. Or peter mandelson.   The coalition raised tuition fees as the Browne review (commissioned by Labour in 2009) recommended that they did- Ed Milliband wrote the Labour 2010 manifesto, in which they said nothing on how to fund extra university places, but which hinted at employing the changes from the review. Peter Mandelson heavily implied this, and in the election campaign Gordon Brown and others argued that "we can't tell you how we're going to fund this- that's why we're waiting for the Lord Browne's review, which we shall implement".   So the coalition confirmed a review that Labour commissioned, and which Ed Milliband had a hand in supporting, both actively in parliament and passively in the manifesto, and only after they lost the election and he became leader, seeing how unpopular it was, suggested a graduate tax- the Lib Dem's idea before the election.
1	Okay, in my opinions, a very large number of people here do not understand how Cass works. You need to build a littler heartier on her, because you are a  sustained  DPS mage, not burst. That being said...   Start out with a Mana crystal + 2 Hpots. Rush the catalyst. Grab boots 1, then turn the cata into RoA. Boots 1 -> Sorc shoes. Then get a Rylai's. Deathcap -> Zhonya's -> Choice last item. I usually go a little more defensive. BV or QSS. I would highly recommend not building CDR on her, since her E becomes a flat cooldown when the target is poisoned, and your Q already recharges before the duration ends. There is no sense in building more CDR than base.   For skills you want to go Q E W E E R E Q E Q R Q Q W W R W W The reasoning behind this is, even though your Q does more damage over time, that is precisely what it is. A DoT. You have no burstyness with it. So in between casts of Q, you will be using your E which is your main source of damage. Yes your Q does more number wise, but not actually DPS more.   The mindset of Cassiopeia is the longer you stay in battle, the more you do. Unlike Annie, who just walks in, blows her spells, and then doesn't do anything. You have to be in the fight longer than other people. As soon as you can get 2 - 3 people in your ult, use it. Spam your Q, use your W in tactical positions that will slow/poison multiple people, and E spam on those squishies that you catch in your poison. You are essentially a midline caster, thus why you need to have a little more health on you. Positioning is what makes Cassiopeia a good character. Knowing how and when to use your spells.
1	So this reply is a little late, but it's something that has really helped me out.  From watching a lot of higher elo streams I noticed that they use their summoners spells sparingly.  The biggest example of this would be flash.  Before picking up this little tip I would flash away from an enemy that was going to kill me only to have him catch up to me and kill me anyways.  Now instead of just gut reaction flashing myself out of a bad situation I will wait a little, see if I can walk to a better position and flash myself over a barrier or back to a tower.  You will die a lot less and you may even find that it will help you calm down and evaluate a team fight better, i.e. positioning and targeting a lot better when you know your exit strategy should things get ugly.
1	Jarvan --- pros: mobile, very tanky, does decent damage without ANY damage items, focuses enemy carry extremely well and makes enemies waste flash cons: can't really solo except for early game, extremely team dependent mid-late game   Irelia --- pros: carrys much harder than jarvan, has cc reduction, higher burst damage, 75 true damage per auto attack!!! cons: less mobile, more dependent on items   In solo que, I would say irelia is more viable ONLY if you can secure a solo lane and you are confident that you can do well against annoying lane opponents such as vlad. Irelia can carry a team harder than jarvan.  Jarvan does pretty well in duo lane and does very good early-mid game damage but is very team dependent.
1	Think of it this way.  Sure, you could look at it as "their abilities get better when their bars are full".  But you could just as easily say "their abilities are not at full strength unless the bar is full."  I mean, look at their abilities, and then compare them to other abilities on similar folks.  Renekton's skills without rage are actually a bit substandard.  (His skills WITH rage are actually a little above average, but most of the time you use the substandard version.  The part that makes him work is that you have some control over when you want to use the awesome version.)   Good Renektons monitor their rage bar and will sometimes NOT CAST SPELLS because they need to save their rage for something.  (More lifesteal or longer stun, usually.)  Rumbles have to walk an even finer line, of keeping their heat high enough to get the full damage, but not so high that they self-silence themselves for 6 seconds.  (6 seconds is a LONG TIME)   I would argue that these champs are far more limited by their resource system than mundo or vlad or trynd are.  When I play Trynd, if an ability is off of cooldown, and I want to use it, I just push the button.  I don't have to think about anything else.  (sure it costs health, but it's so laughably small it might as well not even be there.)  I don't even think about it otherwise.  The only limiting factor is the cooldown.   On the other hand, when I play Renekton or Rumble, I often hold off on using abilities that I would like to use, so that I don't blow my rage/heat too early or on something I don't care about.
1	I think a lot of the reason there's such conformity in league is that unlike starcraft, your game is not purely dependent on your play. As many of us can attest, in the lower ELO games, even if you do everything right, you can easily have a team of people who dont have the brainpower to breathe and use a computer at the same time. (I know, getting to 1400+ means carrying the team. I just dont understand how one is supposed to carry a team that picked three carries before your turn to pick rolls around.)   When I see a master yi rushing malady after demanding solo mid, I don't think "what an interesting and unexpected build. Maybe he tries to use his ult to get up close and hit them a few times, then alpha strike for massive damage on the decreased MR. Clever, they wont expect that." I think "oh god, he has no idea what he's doing, and the cookie-cutter Annie on the other side is going to CRUSH him, and go on to CRUSH the rest of our team." and on a day when I've already had a few sore losses, I'm not very inclined to be supportive to our dear alternate-build Yi.   In starcraft, if you want to do something absurd or off the wall, nobody suffers other than you if it goes horrendously wrong (barring team matches; but the majority of competitive starcraft seems to be focused on 1v1 rather than 2v2 etc.)
1	I wouldn't have raged at you for playing lanewick, but I would be very unforgiving of mistakes.  I don't mind people trying unorthodox builds/playstyles as long as they play smart.  The trouble is a lot of people who try "different" builds and then fail completely at them try to pass it off as don't rage at me because I'm trying something new, when really it was them playing dumb that got them into the position they were in.
1	So I agree with you to a point, but I also think that you're making a somewhat unfair comparison.   First of all, like you I really really hate champion tier lists, and think you ought to play whoever you like.  I hate fotms discovered by high ELO players.   However, strategy-wise, I think you're comparing things in a skewed manner.  As far as builds go, builds on solomid etc. are simply outlines.  Any good player will  adapt  to the current game.  I'm not well versed in SC2, but I'm familiar with SC:BW, and so I will say this:  Builds posted on solomid made by top players are more equivalent to build openers made by top players in SC.  For example.  Westrice opens Akali with AD and AP runes in order to allow himself to spend his initial gold on boots for maneuverability and pots for sustainability all while having a good offense right off the bat while he builds his "core items."  Similarly, Jaedong will open with 9 pool speed in order to keep sufficient pressure on his opponent while he creates the tech necessary for the "core" of his midgame army.   Based on this info alone, you have  no idea  what Westrice will build after his "core" and you have no idea what tech tree Jaedong will build because they  adapt  to their opponents builds.  There is no set build.  Of course openings can change and be experimented with, but I'm talking general trends in the community.  People follow Westrice's build because it's proven to at least be stable, just like people still 9pool or overpool:  they're tried and true by higher tier players.
1	True they also have a much larger player base currently than WoW did at 6 months or a year. Also keep in mind that a year ago Riot GAmes was barely a company, now they have servers across the world and deal with running the second most popular online game in the world. (complete with a huge number of ignorant players who do nothing but bitch) When WoW was having problems blizzard was already a successful game studio.
1	Thanks. On a whim I tried one last time to get my original script to work before trying SavantCast. Turns out it wasn't working because I chose shift + q as the keybind. Apparently activating an item/spell and then shift clicking a target does nothing.
1	Irelia. I sucked at this game as we all did until I played irelia. This was before her nerfs and such but I stopped playing her cause I got bored. Couple months pass and I came back to her, and did terrible. I was devastated and tried a couple different builds until I found one I liked and she's back to being my number one champ, with 85% win ratio in ranked.
1	free to play, dude!   nah, I think what really sets those games apart is that in every mechanical and design decision S2 was following DotA very strong. Riot kind of tried to remove most elements that hinder people new to the genre to get started. When I tried HoN after playing LoL already quite some time, I didn't really get any easy visual feedback from the game.
1	You can say that S2 has a bad rep or LoL has better advertising, but what it really boils down to is that LoL is the first moba that has an easy learning curve. Starting out you face people with similar skill base. In HoN everyone is better than you if you've never played a moba before.
1	I always, always got mega pissy when I would see the Ashe on our team take mid. I was always like WTF.   Then a mate explained to me that Ashe hawkshot could almost reach both lanes mid games when ganking started. Point being that Ashe in mid could hawkshot when MIA was called to help her mates, hawkshot blue buffs etc.   It was not until this that I saw Ashe as not a damage champ but a Utility champ.   So to answer your question, I feel like she still has a massive roll in any team. Yeah Caitlyn can drop traps for constant vision in mid bush (not that it give vision but it traps player as they run though, preventing ganks) and she can finish off with her ulti however as a ranged carry she cannot do what Ashe does in that she can check across the map baron, dragon and buffs.   In terms of poke though, Kog is still friken amazing! His attack speed can be capped at the highest in the game which make him a backdoor slut 9. His ulti can scrub check more often than Ashe hawkshot etc. etc. How ever his CC is no where near that of Ashe's Q or R.
1	Ashe ain't falling out. Requirements to play succesfull AD carry are being thrown to trashcan.   Caithlyn, stun + escape Vayne, Stealth + Stun List goes on   Ashe is one of the only AD carries that if caught, either flashes or dies, it's that simple. In soloque you never know how good your tanks are protecting, never. Even if you assume that janna would protect you from irelia diving you, she prolly wont. In 5v5 format, ashe is still strong when team build around her, where you cannot penetrate the teams defense to get trough to her.   Ashe, true ad carry. Rest are gimmicks, from the era of morello reign. It's simplier for 99% of players to pick someone who majors in easy dmg and easy in-out action. Compared to ashe, she is just left out by the people who don't know her strenghts. Passive is beast earlygame, if you use it on every chance. Volleyharras on certain heroes fucks up with them hard. Base + Ulti to mid @ lvl 6 fucks everything in mid. People only see the Low dmg and Slow on her, when those are the minor things in her gameplay. When used to full extend, she can win games pretty early, her mid game sucks without good team to throw arrows in with, and lategame is ok due to initiate arrow.
1	The problem with Ashe is that she is a  hard carry , but does not scale as well into late game as a better  soft carry  in terms of damage.   Right now that's getting more important, but it's been a core problem for a while. Remember Corki before the nerfs? That's when people first started to realize that soft carries were out damaging Ashe by quite a bit.   Look at the big 'carries' right now: Vayne, Cait, Ezreal, Kog'maw and Urgot.   Are any of them hard carries? Nope. Except Kog'maw they're all immensely strong right from level one. So much so that they can hold a lane against many mages and bruisers. Urgot and Ezreal in particular were for a long time used exclusively as mid-lane champions. They're the softest of the soft carries. Even calling them a carry is misleading. Thus why Vayne was (is?) labeled as an Assassin and Urgot is (was?) labeled as a bruiser.   Ashe? Hard carry. Her early game is  pathetic . Ashe needs to farm her ass off until late game to be useful. Even if she does that her damage output is lower than all of the above (yes, including Urgot and Ezreal). So what's the point of Ashe? She can initiate with R. Something other carries can't reliably do.   A hard carry is supposed to be a nightmare late game. Look at something like a really farmed Kog'maw, Tristana, or Vayne. This is the type of DPS that hard carries are supposed to do. Kog'maw is a very soft carry. Vayne is a pseudo-assassin. Tristana is sort of halfway between hard and soft carry.   Honestly for Ashe to really work without completely redesigning how carries work she either needs her R adjusted (give it a ~30 second CD, make it ~2500 range and halve the stun -- it's just Mirana's arrow anyway), or greatly increase her per-level base stats. Primarily her attack speed. Even then she'd have a few issues.
1	I totally agree with your points. I can understand why games can get very frustrating sometimes, but degrading your teammates definitely does not help turn a losing game around. If anything, it just kills morale (or starts a mutiny and then everyone else comes out of the game feeling worse than they would if they had simply had a bad game). I, for one, definitely feel less inclined to really try hard to turn a bad game around if our team is having a ridiculous mutiny. If you are frustrated and really do care about winning, or doing better, then please, please, maybe try to advise the problem players on what they should/shouldn't do (and in a kind manner, please). When I see other players making silly yet significant errors, I do most of the time try to advise them on how to improve. Granted, this is probably not taken very well most of the time -- if taken at all -- due to the inherently ridiculous nature of the internets. I'd rather have my teammate(s) not take my advice than to start an asinine flame war of sorts, though. It also doesn't make your e-peen any bigger to trash on your teammates and if you really get a kick out of degrading your own team over a game I think you may have some issues of your own that you clearly need to address. Trashing on others does NOT make you look better -- it makes you look like a raging idiot. I don't think anyone likes nor respects raging idiots. You are just worsening a game that may already be bad by being a jerk. Learn to breathe and if necessary, please OD on chill pills. kthxbai
0	This might come as a surprise to you, but how people act on the interwebs and how they actually are, are two different things most of the time. Someone who makes racist and/or sexist jokes on the internet, is not necessarily a racist and/or sexist. You know, stereotypes make for good jokes and guess what, most of the successful comedy shows etc. are based on them.   Plus stuff like "too fat, wouldn't f'%#", "something something sandwich" or "back to the kitchen her derr" are more like a meme than actual opinions.
0	This this this this. Many here are being sarcastic or funny, but then there is the large group that doesn't get that it is a joke with it's time and place and within context can be funny. They think it was funny then so it is funny all the time. Not being too literal here and I have had a few tonight, but you get the point. Think before you speak.
0	You're missing a lot of information in some of these facts. There are some factors that lead to women having custody more often than fathers, judges take into account what the parents want (many, many couples come to a private agreement that the children should be in the mother's primary custody) and which parent has done the majority of the parenting up until the divorce. [Statistics]( still show that despite some positive movement in childcare and home care division, women, even if they work full time as well, still do the majority of the work around the home including caring for children.   Aside from these reasons, women get custody more often than men because society expects them to be the caregivers of their children. When a child goes missing or is hurt society asks "where was the mother?" not so much "where was the father?" When the child is sick at school, its often the mother who has to leave work to go pick them up or take the day off when she can't find alternate childcare arrangements. This mentality hurts men and women. The patriarchy hurts men and women. Men are left out of their children's lives when the couple splits up and women have to bear an unfair portion of the burden of childcare whether they are with the fathers or not.   The same thing for domestic violence and rape. Both men and women face a lot of shame and recrimination when they are abused but for different reasons. Men who are abused are shamed because women are seen as weak, men are expected by society to be strong and "in charge" of their woman. As for male rape, men are expected to want sex all the time. This makes it very difficult for male victims of rape and domestic violence to come forward and seek the help they need.   Lesbians, especially lesbians that men find attractive, are seen as more positive because some men see lesbian sexuality as a performance for their pleasure. Gay men are seen as effeminate. Traditional society ostracizes any man who acts like a woman especially if he goes so far as to be penetrated during sex because being feminine or womanly is a bad thing (   Rigid gender roles: women are maternal, weak sex objects; men are horny, strong, can't control themselves sexually hurt everyone and the root cause is still sexism. This is something a lot of people, especially younger people don't understand about feminism. Much like racism benefits white people on one level, it is destructive to society and ends up hurting everyone, sexism does the same. While you as a man may make more money, not face the same social pressures regarding your appearance, not be chided for not doing your share of household chores and be less likely to face intimate violence you're still stuck in a very rigid social role that limits you.
1	No. Just. No.   Fanboy-ism, as you call it, makes everything worse. You should watch streams because YOU enjoy the streamer for whatever reason. Maybe you want to improve your game on a specific role, a streamer specializing in that would obviously rank higher than another.   Maybe you enjoy watching people rage (cause it's funny to some people), go ahead and watch rageshotgg, but personally, I'd rather avoid that bullshit and not see the plague that ruins this community. Raging at teammates destroys this game, and I'd much rather watch someone who doesn't call his teammates retards, no matter how bad they are.   The number of viewers on a stream is simply popularity, and that comes from many things. Hotshot got his viewers (most likely, I honestly have no clue how/why people can watch him) from his plays at a tournament with Nidalee. And following that, just because a stream is popular, doesn't mean it's good, nor does it mean that it's what you personally would like to watch.
1	Lee Sin is a natural jungler and is played there most of the time - hence why people expect you to jungle when you pick him. Kind of like Udyr, who is a strong solo top but is almost exclusively played in the jungle due to his advantages there.   Saying that jungling is "reckless" and "dangerous" is pretty silly. It gives you a big advantage in farming and xp if your enemy doesn't have one, as long as someone can hold a 2v1 lane which isn't actually that hard if they can last hit from under tower. Jungling is a very important role and control of buffs and dragon is not to be underestimated.   Lee is not the easiest champ to jungle either due to his sustain not being as good at early levels but he has very strong ganks. I would try out Udyr for jungling if you haven't done that - he clears the jungle extremely fast, and you can gank easily at lv4 after a full clear + wraiths, not to mention he has great sustain with turtle and stays relevant lategame.   As someone else mentioned, it doesn't hurt to try a few different routes against bots and figure out what paths are working for you. Especially with the new jungle, you have to be opportunistic about ganking. You can't afford to just camp a lane for 2 minutes and wait for them to overextend - if you see an overextended lane, gank it. If you can't gank, keep farming.
0	This is in fact a true story, but not because the guy you were dealing with is a scum bag. My store may be different than others but, if I don't sell a certain $ amount every hour (Or make up for it by selling double the amount in the next hour, etc) I can get penalized. Loss of pay, loss of hours, all kinds of rediculous shit because I didn't offer you that $50.00 router instead of the $3.00 cables you needed. He probably knew all too well that's all you needed, but he doesn't want to get fired. Radioshack, Best buy, pretty much any electronics store does this shit. They lure in the tech savvy to work there, then they force them to lie, cheat, and steal from their customers.   Example: At radioshack we offer a $0.99 "insurance" plan on all wires. It's totally optional, yet I am told every day to "Put it on the ticket without telling them, they won't miss that dollar, and we get rewards when our RSSP (Radio Shack Service Plan) is high enough." I never do it though. I always ask. And 75% of the time customers will say "No thanks, I just need it for one job, no RSSP for me." And I remove the RSSP from their ticket.
1	Well to be honest, some may see this is selling Ahri short on her usual glass-cannon role. I on the other hand heavily disagree. A lot, ( and I mean A LOT ) of people tend to play "by the book" and that's all good for the most part, it's safe, not much variation between games etc etc.   BUT!   Building your champ in a way that fits your playstyle and still meets the need of your champion can work well too. Ahri as a tanky AP can work very well. People will innately expect her to be a champ that can be shot down in moments, in a teamfight or 2v2 (AP mids and Junglers) a build such as this can shatter an enemy's comfort zone.   For instance, I play Karthus and usually, I do a lot of damage but once the Late late game comes around, ADs usually take me out in moments. I've had some games where I completely deviated from my normal karthus build and went tank Karthus because I was tired of the problems I faced lategame. I picked Karthus appopriate items that addressed my needs and endgame was my teams tank, and highest Damager.   OF course though, some, none, or all of this may or may not apply depending on if you are a high level or low level, playing normals vs ranked.
0	Whether or not you took it for granted only you know, but leaving the nest takes this concept from everybody. It's how, you know, you grow up. That said, I'm about to be 27 and really only after getting my own condo, installing cabinets with my girlfriend using my own powertools,  and  buying a badass propane grill that barely fits (disassembled and boxed) in the back of our Yukon have I  begun  to feel like the man I saw in my father when I was young. Haha!   Edit:  Also, learning some awesome whiskey&garlic meat marinades, making pancakes from scratch with sliced fruit and homemade whip, and owning a bottle of scotch that's almost as old as I am.
0	Take it from a guy who's mom and stepdad would routinely have lobster and other fancy meals while us kids got store-brand mac-and-cheese (Kraft was "too expensive"), this shit hurts. I don't give a fuck who's making the dinner. I would have made it myself! Was I a bratty teen-ager? I'd like to think that I was just hurt by the fact that some jerk she met two years prior (and who beat her, no less) got better food then her own children on a regular basis.   What does this have to do with the OP? Stop assuming that the kid described is acting entitled. Maybe he's sick of chicken nuggets after having had them for nights on end while his mother buys her expensive cookies every day. Maybe he could have gotten pizza pockets if his mom got the Keeblers that day. Maybe he feels like he's burdening his parents because of all this, and his friend is submitting this so that he can show him the comments and through them how his mother's behavior isn't right.   Life as a kid isn't all fun and games. I would never return, not even if I could somehow game it to my advantage. Having to rely on someone I didn't quite trust for everything was a nightmare! God, and especially so when other adults used to bitch me out for being ungrateful. I didn't even know what I was supposed to be grateful  for ! The lectures and endless ridicule? The constant punishment for thoughts I never articulated (including my all-time favorite "you think you know more then me, don't you. Well fine, you're grounded")? The knowledge that my siblings would take the heat if I wasn't there to soak it up for them? How is asking for  Kraft  when they got  lobster  and  prime rib  being spoiled? How retarded was my angst and depression? At least now when I buy crappy food I don't have to deal with people telling me how awful I am because I'd prefer to be eating stuff that tasted better.   All that said, you're right. Maybe I should have just been grateful that she was the one cooking the mac-and-cheese that night, despite the smell of seafood from down the hall... aha, yeah, right. Rest assured that I've forgiven my mother... but I'll be damned if I ever forget. Remember this if you're a parent. I mean, at least don't let your kids know about how you're enjoying your food while they aren't.
1	I'm not completely sure what you mean by hard carrying, but i'm assuming that it means you're doing well in terms of kills and cs. Early game is defined by how well you lane and it sounds like you have that under control. If you don't win the game after starting out with an advantage, the problem seems to be that you're not utilizing the advantage.   If you find that you or your teammates are ahead in a game, try to group your team for objectives like dragons and tower instead of just sitting in lane waiting for the opponents to catch up. This can be hard to do at low elo because not many people realize the importance of objectives, but liberal use of pings will help you convince your team.   This way the game will end before the team fight stage, which will ensure you a win even with a weaker team comp.   Once late game comes along, it can be hard to win some games due to weaker team comps or incompetent players on pivotal roles.
1	Today I wanted to test Corki and practice some last hitting since I watched a video with Ocelote playing Cas and using the "a" key to last hit which I found interesting. Anyways I ran intro this two dudes and decided to ignore them and practice without pushing any towers. You could imagine the in-game chat, personally I found it to be sad and hilarious at the same time because they were saying "Corki fail", "fker", "fagg" (yes with double g) etc and I was wondering what is going on and was laughing the whole game probably.
1	So not my viewpoint on things. I have a plus record in normal and a negative record in ranked and ranked just makes me want to stab myself in the eye repeatedly. Normals, whatever my hElo may be, are more fun and more people know wth they're doing and are not trolling extremely hard. My sister has been lvling up her account and I occasionally duo queue with her in normals. She's around lvl 18 now and I get more competent people there (who are not lvl 30 yet) than I get in my ranked games. I'm not saying all my ranked games are bad, but most of the time they suck.   Elo is nice and all to have a ranking system and to a certain degree it works and over a very long time it evens out. However, there are A LOT of types of players who can get extremely fed up with it and just stop playing ranked entirely. The post Elementz made a while back about ranked not being fun to play for people below a certain Elo lvl still applies.   For myself fe: I function and play better when I play with and against players who are a lot better than me. I learn quickly and in general I can get myself on equal lvl fairly quickly. I've done this in FPS, MMO's and other games. You just put on the tryhard pants and try to keep up and for me that works out fine. That way of learning games is blocked up to a certain point unless one can get higher ranked players to queue with them, which is hard.   I'm just saying that I feel that to a certain degree the lvl of progression is severely limited due to the fact that the game matches you with players of equal caliber. It takes hundreds of games to get a correct estimate of someones Elo, according to most ppl here and on the official forums. However your starting place within the 0-1800ish range is decided in only 10 matches. And everyone who starts average (around 1200) has to deal with newcomers who might be considerably better or considerably worse for at least 10-20 wins (ie. until he reaches 1300-1400 range). And yeah you could potentially carry yourself from 1200 and up, but with ~12 points per won game that takes quite some effort and is probably only really doable if you could hold your own in the >1800 Elo bracket.
1	And now I had a game on 1,8k ELO!, in which a guy in lobby wanted to instalock eve + troll roaming and feeding. Somehow I told him that trolling is bannable and he stopped his idea, picked Corki (while we already had Graves) ...went top and lost it, because he couldn't play like not having vision - he was autopushing and let skarner gang him 3 times. We also had a dc karthus till 0;00 to like 10;00! So when he went back, we were loosing so hard that we couldn't stop it I guess.   In such situations/games there should be a "loose forgiven" - for the players in the lost team and elo decrease should be done only to the players who was afk or dc 2+ min... ofc the winning team should get their elo increased. Also there should be a REMAKE + PAUSE options. They are on the tournaments = competetive games, but WHY NOT ON RANKEDS??? AT LEAST ON THE TEAM rankeds...
1	but who cares he will sink to it with other peoples because of him. Those other guys do.   Why does every post about ELO always have to assume that players lose elo because of bad other players? It's simply not true, at least not over a big number of games. And in a game like LoL ist absoultely idiotic to worry about one specific game. Even assuming Mr. IDidNotWin will start with a losing streak, every game there will be     4 players who "get dragged down"     5 players who will get more ELO       ==> on average, the players that belong in ~1200 will profit from the constant stream of noobs
1	Over a large number of games no, sure, I'm playing a smurf at the moment, and I was stuck at 1400-1500 elo for a good 20 games, most of these games I literally reached legendary in killing spree, ganking other lanes when I could without losing to much but both other lanes, despite my efforts went 0/8+/0 in every other game. Now that is no problem, because I'm at 1707 atm and rising (14 winstreak, which is not surprising considering I am a smurf.) But the amount of nonsense you have to deal with is heart breaking, to be honest, and if you do not believe in yourself enough it will drag your own performance down also, a losing streak where you have done well but the team still lost will make you care less, will make you take bigger risks in order to try to force the victory. Which is something people do not factor in when they claim elo hell doesn't exist.   But the thing is, right now I have a lot of time on my hands and I can just keep playing til I reach my elo, however people can be busy irl and not have time to sit down for 5+ games every day and they will be stuck in elo for ages, if you belong at 1600 elo you will have a very very difficult time carrying people in 1400 because it's a roll of the dice, if you are good enough you can exploit winning your lane into snowballing into other lanes (easiest as mid.) But if both mid and top go 0/8/0 and you aren't good enough to have stopped that in the making (asuming that it's even possible, sometimes people just keep dying because they keep fighting while at a disadvantage, Ex. level 6 wukong rushing in and ulting a level 11 nidalee while he is 0/6/0 and she is 6/3/2 in the middle of his lane, with her lane pushing with a massive amount of creeps (an example from one of my games during hte 1400-1500 period)
1	To be perfectly honest what ever your team pick if everyone play his best chances are that you are going to win. If you start flaming because people random or play a shitty champ (or an usual one that may be good) chances are that you will lose this game only because someone will not even try.
1	Though I would never random on purpose, the recent glitches have left me with some very interesting matchups. One time I randomed support Nocturne (I had only bought Nocturne to get his limited skin), but I was with a Sivir and the enemy AD was an Ezreal. Double spellshield became his undoing and I went 4/4/19 in the end with full support items and eventually a warmog's.   What I guess I might be trying to illustrate is that though you might random a champion, possibly even one you never played before, make the best of the situation. Read a quick-and-easy guide in loading screen and anything can work if you are skilled enough (This was when I was around 1470 elo. Admittedly not exceptionally high, but none of the players on either team were unskilled). I've been pulling off support Wukong, support Lee Sin and even support Karthus with success in ranked.
1	I'm going under the assumption you never played Eve when she was good then? That or you have something under 300 games. Eve is a horrifically horrible champion that needs dramatic changes before she's any form of viable.   Why?   Because she's a squishy damage dealer with no real escapes. High damage does not make up for that, her only CC is slow, I see AP carries like karthus who deal more damage and have better CC that Eve does.   OH NO BUT SHE CAN INVIS IT'S COOL.   um. no. it's not, 400 gold and you turn from shit to abysmal.   Eve works only MARGINALLY in solo queue because people generally don't buy oracles, and there's little to no co-ordination between players. Even then she's still horribad.
1	I feel awkward with her scaling. I try getting a Giant's Belt pretty early, so I can get some damage on her W, but it just feels like she doesn't ever get faster at clearing the jungle.   I can't help but compare her to Amumu, who has mirrors of most abilities. With a Rylai's on Amumu they play really similarly. (Also I hadn't thought about the Skarner comparison before, I believe I would prefer Skarner over her in terms of tanky initiators)   Amumu as least has AP ratios. Amumu at least has the option to throw a Rylai's or Abyssal Scepter into his build if he sees fit for various reasons. After doing so, landing his Q will actually hurt. When he pops his ultimate, it will do some damage.   Sejuani has no option of damage. Not even in a half-optimal form. In addition to naturally meh damage, they give her undesirable AP ratios (except perhaps her ult and even then, Amumu's scales better).
1	I play a good amount of Sejuani (enough to justify buying a skin) and while I agree that her damage is subpar for the most part, it is NOT ignorable if you build around it.   After the usual philo stone and heart of gold, I always go for Sorc shoes and a sunfire cape. Sunfire cape is a great item for Sejuani (just like Amumu) because it meshes with her playstyle perfectly. She HAS to stick to people to do damage with her W and Sunfire basicly adds 44 DPS to it. Sorc shoes helps keep her W and Sunfire cape damage relevant past the early-mid game.   I sure people will bitch about how Sunfire cape is a bad item (it's very situational, not bad) but if you go full super duper tank (merc/tabi, frozen heart/FoN), people will simply ignore you because you do no damage and if people ignore you as a tank, you are doing a bad job. The reason skarner and udyr have to build super tanky is because that have to run up to people to engage a team fight (and eat tons of damage on their way). Sejuani has the benefit of being able to ult half the team and Q-E into them before they can even react. With this type of engagement, you don't NEED to be an ultra tank, just tanky enough to survive long enough to do damage with W.   I just don't think she needs anything right now. A lot of people are clamoring for Nautilus right now but even Sejuani does a few things better then him. Adding more damage to her would hella OP considering she has an amazing ult, good CC and good damage mid-game and further (early game her damage is terrible).
1	you can start red just fine with boots or sej, but the problem is if her first gank is ineffective (at least forces the lane you ganked to back) she just wasted alot of time and hp there.   for teamfights her cc is basically unparalleled and she makes a great tank line of just 1 person. but as a tank her consta aoe damage seems to be ignorable (like seeing a tank cho with only tank items)... i think that's the way she was meant to be so that a 5 man premade could utilize her massive cc but you just aren't going to see that kind of cooperation in norms, or even 5 mans that are just starting out as a team.
0	The grass is always greener.  I have a theory that the porn one watches has all the qualities that your partner does not (this usually holds true for men, not always women).  For instance, my ex is petite, b-cup, and smart as hell.  When I dated her, the porn I looked at was usually of thicker, huge tittied women (Lisa Ann types).  Now that we're broken up, the porn I look at is more along the lines of my ex's body type.
1	Actually, generally it does. He had a good point. M5 don't look healthy at all, some of them look very skinny. You also had a good point too though, I'm sure they do eat healthily that is probably their mental physique side of it but personally I think that they are all very unfit in any other aspect other then their mind.
1	I totally agree with this.   I used to be a mega noob (not that I am that good now) and had major problems with flaming and stying focused etc.   Now I always take a break inbetween games and do a bit of workout with some weights. This is drastically improved my performances. Now I am always focused on winning and I never give up.
1	I have a personal trainer. It's great for feeling good. But I wouldn't dream about claiming anything like it improves my game play, rather the opposite. After a work out, I'm just tired and sleepy and my reaction time goes way down. Couple of days after my muscles are sore and slow. Sure, in general my fitness is increased, I'm getting stronger and faster with better stamina. But the only way I see that affecting game play is if I would do a marathon session where endurance becomes more important possibly, and I wouldn't recommend those marathon sessions to anyone either. I bet that if anyone anywhere claims to notice an effect, it is just placebo effect - the power of faith alone could make a difference since anything competitive is a mental game to a large degree.
1	I did this as Solotop Ryze cuz I saw SV go 0-9-something as Top Kennen because he was camped by the jungler. He made sure to not get any kills in team fights and keep up with farm.   For me, I knew Ryze had a weak early game and I got camped by Lee Sin. I was 0-5. You have to make sure you're keeping up with farm though. Of course you'll be a long way's back because they have gold from kills/assists, but they usually take your tower fast which lets you get more farm and they're forced to take jungle creeps/roam.   Ended up winning (I didn't carry, but I was still very useful) and going 2-7 (accidentally took 2 kills in the last team fight).
0	Back in middle school, my teacher called out each of our ssn to the respective student so we could write our own down.   This one kid writes my ssn on his folder and tells the others he wrote it down and was going to keep it. Me being the scrawny asian kid and him being the big mexican kid, there was no way I could physically erase/remove it while he was watching. I tried to tell the teacher in class, but she ignored me.   Luckily, after class, we left our folders there.   I took the opportunity to confront her again, and sure enough, my ssn was written in black ink on the front of the kid's folder. She ripped it off and apologized to me. She thought he was joking.
0	I wasn't bullied (only due to me making it known I had black belt in martial arts), but I was a complete geek and hung out with complete geeks who got bullied (mentally and physically).  My solution?  I dropped out after 10th grade by getting my parents to tell the school system I was being homeschooled, got my GED at 16 and went to college.  Best decision I ever made.  Software Engineer now and at 27, I'm making more now than what I set for a goal when I was 40.  In other words, you won't miss anything that you can't learn in college.   My wife, on the other hand, had an excellent high school experience and cannot relate at all to my school experience.
0	Honestly... lots of the teachers I knew were/are scared to stand up and say something.  Hell, it took me a year before I could finally say something when I knew a kid was getting picked on.  I was terrified, scared of parents, scared of administration reprimands, scared of losing my job because the bully makes a fuss.  Also, scared of the bully.  If the kid has the balls to call someone a fag in the middle of class, what would the do to the teacher?  Man, some things that students have said to me made me go home and drink myself into a stupor.  It's finding that fine line of when you need to intervene and when you need to let the kid learn for themselves.   I would love to step into this whole thing and say the same things as you.  I honestly never did allow that kind of language in my classroom.  But name calling happens and one can't always police the entire school or classroom.  I've always felt that students seem to think of teachers as infallible, then get frustrated when they turn out to be normal people.  Yes there are bad teachers.  Yes (at least in the US) you'll probably get more mediocre or poor teachers than good ones. I know that I've let things go that I shouldn't have.  Why? I dunno, it was a bad choice.  If a kid asked me specifically to help would I? You bet your ass.
0	See that really doesn't work all the time. I'm a big guy (also fat) and everyone always felt they could poke fun at me. Not a serious constant bullying but enough to get on my nerves. So I told them to fuck off. Most of them were like "k, whatever we thought you were cool with it" and those aren't bullies in my opinion. There were a few (4 or 5) guys left who still thought it was hilarious to continue and one day one of them threw my waterbottle on the ground and I'm like "The fuck you do that for, stop it or I'll break your neck" so he thinks I'm joking and throws it on the ground again and I'm like "I will not say this again. Stop it or I will kill you." so he starts laughing and throws it on the ground again. I see red, push over the desk, grab him, put my arm around his neck and start choking the fuck out of him, while telling him "I told you this was gonna happen, why didn't you listen?". So he starts turning blue but I can't back down from what I promised him, I would just look weak and encourage this kind of behavior. I keep choking him and the other people now start shouting "Stop it ZeMilkman, don't kill him." but they are far away and I don't give a fuck. I see those 2 guys coming in and I know they will try to separate us and so I choke even harder to kill him before they do. Now they realize what's going on they start trying to get me off him but all they manage to do is loosen the choke a little, so they start shouting the names of 2 more guys who come in and now I have 2 guys pulling on each of my arms and they manage to get him out. So now the stronger 2 of them are restraining me, the other 2 are tending to the guy I am still intent on killing. So I struggle to get my arms free, lifting the one guy off his feet in the process. He lets go of my arm and now it's easy to get the other arm free. I am about to end the guy when I glance around and I see the terror on everyone faces, including my crush at that time. So I stop and tell him that he is lucky I will put mercy before justice this one time.   He never bothered me or anyone else again and we actually started hanging out together for a while.
0	3rd grade teacher here. I work in a low-income, inner-city school district.   We're currently dealing with a lot of bullying in my classroom. The kids are constantly calling each other "fags" or "gay" or "retarded". At least once a day, I hear the bullying. When I hear it, I try to deal with it. I try to stress to them that being "gay" a "girl"or "retarded" is not bad, so we need to stop using those labels as insults.   However, I can only deal with it when I hear it. I can't send students to the office because someone else said they called them a name. I have to actually hear (or see) these things happen. For example, yesterday my phone was stolen. The phone was found in one of my student's desks (which I can't actually go through, because of privacy issues). Although we had multiple other students telling us that another student stole the phone, then handed it off to the other student, the student whose desk we found it in got suspended because he actually had it. We have no proof the other student stole it.   Then, when the S1 was written, we couldn't actually say that the student stole it. We had to say that we found the student with the phone, which leads us to believe he was the one who stole it. There have been too many issues with parents in the past who say "Did you see him actually steal it? Then how do you know it was him?"   And as for the tattling - I don't punish for it, but I have multiple students with whom it reaches extreme levels. I kid you not, they will come up to me about once every 10 minutes, usually to tell me that "so-and-so looked at me! Make them stop looking at me!" It has reached the point where we have had to have discussions and threaten to call parents about the tattling. Otherwise, my entire day would be taken up with listening to the kids complain about their peers. Sometimes the tattling is legitimate. Usually it's not. When I have 7 hours, (although, once you factor in the 15 minutes in the morning to get settled, the 2+ hours for specials/lunch/recess and the half hour to pack up at the end, I usually have closer to 4 hours) to teach these kids something,  I don't have time to be dealing with petty tattling. The tattling usually results in tears from some party involved, which then disrupts the whole class and there's more time gone.   I can't punish hearsay. If one of my kids tells me someone called them something, I can confront them about it, but if they deny it, I'm stuck.   I've tried to become hyper-vigilant. I've learned which students are my bullies and I try to watch them like a hawk, but with 26 kids demanding my attention, I miss stuff. And it sucks.   Which isn't to say I don't sometimes punish the bullies, even if I don't see it. I might get worried my ass will be on the line if one of the bullies goes home and tells mom, but it will get to the point where I'll have to throw that fear out the window.   The worst part is - no matter how many times I reprimand them or we have discussions about why we need to stop using labels as insults, it will still continue. It will continue when my back is turned, or when they're out at the playground. It will happen when they think I'm not listening, but I actually am. It will still happen, and I have yet to find a surefire way to stop it.   It scares me to death that one day, it will be one of my kids who commits suicide because they're being bullied. They're my babies and the thought of anything happening to my kids hurts. I can try my hardest to see it, but I know I can't see it all, and if I can't see it, I can't punish it.   We're not ALL heartless teachers, looking for any crack that we can use to build ourselves up while tearing our students down. Most of us got into education so we could try to make a difference with our students.   And just for the record, I don't have "snitches get stitches" tattooed across my chest.
0	It's been misappropriated, but originally [in England this is what it means](
1	The only time I find it appropriate to gloat is when someone else starts it. For example, earlier I had a game where an Ahri got a double kill from a bad tower dive and said "you noobs are pathetic, GG easy game" from that point on we proceeded to steamroll their team because they weren't actually good. And everyone spent the rest of the game mocking the Ahri because she played pretty poorly.
0	This happened to me the very first time I ever went to my girlfriends house to meet her family.  She had warned me prior to arriving: Don't shit in the downstairs bathroom. I forgot about that.   We get there and it's great.  Her dad loves me, her little brother loves me, her little sister and mom love me.  Even her family dog loves me.  We;re all hanging out in front of the fireplace watching a movie and laughing and joking and the familiar feeling begins to stir in my guy.  I politely excuse myself and head to the bathroom.  I didn't realize it at the time but they were all giving each other sly looks.  So I poop.  I wipe.  I flush.  But the toilet, she doesn't go down.  In fact, it starts filling up even more.  I panic; I try holding the handle down,  nothing .  Water still rising, now brown and chunky.  I wash my hands, burning myself in the process (their 'hot' tap gets to  hot  faster and hotter than anything else in the world).  I go out and my girlfriends dad is standing there, arms crossed, looking very stern.  " DID YOU CLOG MY TOILET, SON? " he says.  This is the first day I've met him.  He's as tall as I am (6'4") but BUILT, and he was in the Vietnam war.  He's got a gut, but he's strong as an ox.  Now he's standing in front of me, arms crossed, looking angry as fuck. My girlfriend comes in from behind him; "Oh no, mighteee what have you done?!"   I'm standing there pale, all blood gone form my face, embarrassed as hell, when her little 8 year old brother loses it and starts laughing, "HAHAHA IT DOES THAT ALL THE TIME!" So her dad gets me a beer and plunges the toilet for me.  Hilarious.  I'm still with her.
0	Had a brother that had a girlfriend that was Vegan.  She comes over for Christmas and when my mother serves dinner it is pretty much all meat.  She then, from what I remember in drunkenness, complained the whole time about how everywhere she goes no one ever has vegan options.   My mother said that if she was told in advanced that she would have no problem making something for her.  While my mother was setting up a huge dinner, she stops and makes some vegan crap for this girl.   THEN SHE TURNS IT DOWN, because she doesn't like it.   I know it's not because she is a vegan but instead because she is a cunt, but common.  Being vegan is not like a handicap where you should expect special accommodations everywhere you go.  You don't go to someones house and mock them for not having stuff for your special diet.
0	I bring my own food to family gatherings and it gets gone before the nonvegan food. Fuckers ate my goddamn cake.
0	I know it probably sounds silly but it just seems like one of those things that annoys me.   Vegan/vegetarian is a choice, but almost on another level. I don't like a lot of foods and I make the choice not to eat them but if there's a little bit of it in my food (or it came in contact with that thing) I'm not going to shy away like it's poison. I see a lot of vegetarians who behave that way and it just makes it inconvenient.
0	Completely relevant:  as a kid I misunderstood the transformers theme song, and instead of "more than meets the eye" I thought it was someone's name: "Mordan Meetsdeei". I was way too old when I learned the truth, after years trying to figure out who Mordan was on the show.
0	The annoying thing is vegan/vegetarian food is super delicious and completely A-OK for non-vegetarians to eat, so they pile it on just like anything else. This causes a problem; vegetarians and vegans have limited options, but their food is consumed just as much as anything else is, leaving them with very little.
0	Just the other day, my Mom asked me if I wanted to go out for supper for my Grandma's birthday. Since I'm a  vegan, I rarely go out to eat, except Thai and Vietnamese places where it's easy to get a meat-free meal without any fuss. Nevertheless, I decided I'd go even though this supper is going to be at a place that pretty much only serves meat. So I decided to call, book the table, and casually inquire about possible meatless / dairy free options.   The Lady informed me that, after speaking to a chef, the only thing they could do for me was a plain salad with Italian dressing. I asked her 'surely, since 26 people ($$$) were coming to this dinner, your chef could throw something together for me? I don't expect much, but something resembling a supper shouldn't be too difficult...' She said no. There's really nothing they can do. She even asks me 'well, how serious are you? You could have a lasagna with tomato sauce...' &#3232;_&#3232;   I ended up booking it anyway, since it's my Grandma's favourite restaurant. Seriously though, what kind of 'chef' can't stir-fry some vegetables over some rice or something. Jeez. Well, I'm going to order that damn salad, and I'm going to follow it up with a PB&J from home, which I will eat with utensils like the classy motherfucker that I am.
0	I think if we had any sort of food culture in this country, it wouldnt even be an issue. Very few people abroad are vegans, because they learn how to ear properly (lots of fruits and veggies, little meat), and their food is healthy (not processed, not as many sweets, no GMO foods, properly raised meat).
0	I posted this in another spot in this thread, but its a real thing--it just may not be representative of the majority.   Look at this way. I meet 100 people.   One of them introduces himself by saying "Hey, I'm John.  I'm a vegan.  I'm a kickass vegan cook; I've won awards for it, but I'm not about the awards, man, i"m just about . . . you know . . . caring for animals."   The other 99 just tell me their names.   I walk away thinking that I met one vegan, and that he was obnoxious as hell.  In truth, maybe 9 out of those 99 were also vegan, but not hipster douchebags who were starved for attention by their parents.   My perception is skewed, because I think I met one obnoxious vegan and in truth I met 10 vegans and only 1 was obnoxious--but it's not really my fault my perception is skewed.  I'm not being dishonest.  My perception of the situation is genuine, just incomplete.
0	Like I tried to say: I dont know you and i dont know what kind of person you are, i have only read the comments.  I dont think ive made any assumptions or assertions about what kind of person you are, only about how the contents of your comments seem to me.  And some of it seems a bit judgmental.   Compare:  >you sound a little self-rightous to me   to   >[vegetarians are] self-rightous...[vegetarians are] obnoxious.   If you were referring anecdotally to your four shitty housemates, maybe that could have been clearer from the start.   Additionally, I am not sure which came first: your asshole vegan housemates or your awareness/ assimilation of the "standard vegetarian stereotype". Chicken or the egg?  Also: confirmation bias, as i mentioned earlier.  Which you did not respond to.   Did you notice that you misquoted my ' you sound self-rightous' statement as 'you are self rightous'?  That is not what I said, nor what I meant.  Careful with those 'being' verbs, because then we get into identity territory, and defensiveness.   I have tried to refrain from telling you what you "are," but I do not feel you have afforded nameless others the same courtesy.  Am I more clear? I am far mor interested in explaining myself than undercutting you.
0	Yeah, I get the gist of what youre saying.  Do you?   >[because most vegans are vegans for ethical reasons...Most seem to assume that one would only be vegan for ethical reasons   Do you see the fallacy here?  I understand the tendency for this to occur, but that doesnt make it valid.   Because most people like chocolate, I could assume that everyone likes chocolate.  I would be wrong.  I can defend it however I want, but is simply and provably false.  I can say that you got the gist of what i meant, but what I said is still wrong.   I realize that the " most ...assume that one would only be vegan for ethical reasons" was my statement originally, and now youre in the position of defending a statement that you didnt even make in the first place.   Honestly, I'm confused about what youre arguing for.
0	Pretty limited actually on the T.V. via youtube.....umm..must remember, last time consumed any main-stream media.   Long story? O.K. years ago I got kinda depressed and watched about about 5 hours worth of scrubs clips/shows via youtube. I've looked at enough Dr. House and Arrested Development threads/jokes with pictures to get some of the joke's and recognize characters. However,  I have no idea what their voices' sound like because i've never watched a clip of any of them, so I actually have only the fiatest idea if the words people here put on them correlate to the actual show, but since this has occasionally allowed me to laugh at a joke while off the net and in public, i know that at least some of the time you guy's are honest. That's... uh, about it. i don't think i could name 5 other t.v. shows that are post 1995 at least, and not heavily till the 80's, and reruns. I watched T.V probably an average of 10 hours a week, with the occational day of pure T.V., until I was 14-16 then I stopped for the most part.   Last movie I saw in the theater was 300, at it's release time, and a friend twisted my arm to go..ah, fairly literally on that last bit. I pirate nothing.  I think 300 is actually the last movie i've seen on or off the net, but maybe I'm forgetting something.   Current media indulgences, entertainment's and educating   i do lissen to the radio, some music, Capital Public and NPR, on an actual radio. I watch old nature shows and documentaries or occasional musicians I like on youtube. Bill hicks, George Carlin, Harry Chapin, LOTS of world music, classical, indian raga , ahh, Does Ron Paul count? I watch rather a lot of Ron Paul and Glen Greenwald. I'm a reddit polic all conversations junkie who just lost her way moonlighting here after caring too much. I'm WAY to busy being serious to waste time on tv., and making "frivolous" comment's like this one is just a healthy steam realease. Oh, that remindes me... i don't play any computer games and have not in 5 years. though i would also say that reddit  is  my computer game. Tack on 30 hours a week+ at my job spent actually working, plus life. I cook a lot, keep house. I read a book every month or so, or sometimes one a day if I'm feeling voracious. I do eye exercise and my vision has actually been improving since I started a computer job and a reddit Habbit 5 years ago.   (oh, and, no i actually don't watch any porn. at all. but I totally respect all you guy's and gal's and your right to. I do look at imager too much and, by my standards, that's  almost  porn.

1	it's essentially a fake turn time honestly, and right click -> W is actually much harder to accomplish correctly than just clicking W, it's another action you have to preform, imagine a nidalee running directly alongside a wall then right when it got to a thin part she immediately jumps about double the length of a riven dash right through that  wall with no delay whatsoever. Nidalee's cant do this right now, it will always take a little bit of time to turn so you can jump that wall, you cant click behind it because then you'll just path around it, you may not even be able to click right onto it because you're so close to the wall already that your character wouldn't finish rotating by the time he finished pathing.
1	Just before that made our premade 5s rating worthless and introduced teams (not complaining it was a good move). We went and played a bunch of ranked 5's with 5 supports. Taric jungler, Sona solo top, Soraka mid and AD Janna + Alistar actual support. This was about 1800 elo   We ended up winning all 4 games and everyone was laughing, getting drunk and really having a good time.   Me less so - I had to play the real support Alistar. But still - it was great, I like being around people who're having fun.
1	After losing a very discouraging ranked game and dropping below 1200 elo, I somehow brought myself to start another one, which was the best ranked game I've ever played. I jungled Udyr, and with every successful gank I said "gj" to my teammates (I normally do this) and they picked it up and  said it back to me and themselves . Throughout the whole game we were communicating well and complimenting eachother on plays done right, and bracing eachother even when things went wrong. We won, and I congratulated the team on such a positive attitude. Game in a million, that one.
1	My friend and I queued up for a ranked game and we ended up getting another group of duo queuers who were randoming, so we said fuck it and we randomed and we both got supports. In the game everybody went mid and us and the other duo queuers all bought recommended items on mostly supports. We were at one point 10+ kills down and we ended up winning the game.
1	I wanted to play Shaco, but someone else picked him before I could. So I picked Twitch as a joke. I didn't lock, but Shaco already had. Then someone picked Eve, and locked. Then we had a jungle Nocturne who locked, and I decided to go for it. (I think our fifth was Nasus, but he just stayed top the whole game and didn't join in on the fun).   So we get in and attempt laning for a few minutes but it doesn't go well. Conveniently the enemy doesn't have a jungler, so me and Eve double their jungle, while Nocturne and Shaco double ours. Meanwhile, the enemy is pushing out our lanes. So we four-man gank mid. Then we four-man bot.   Rinse and repeat. We won that game, and I honestly think a good part of that was because we were actually willing to break the rules and have fun. I should have added those guys. They were amazing players.
0	Thanks, Ben. I just wanted to dispel something before this thread got too out of hand. I DO have currently have friends to celebrate my birthday with. And a wonderful, wonderful wife.   I get depressed during my birthdays, and I'm think many other people do for similar reasons. I didn't have a lot of friends growing up. I was always too embarrassed to invite schoolmates over to my place. My parents were immigrants and I always felt like my household was too poor and too weird (minority) for my white friends to hold a party. It was also right after the school year, so it was even more awkward for me to think about calling up schoolmates that I never hung out with outside of school. Not having childhood birthday parties with friends was very depressing as a kid, and it's one of the few reasons for me to still get depressed as an adult.   I apologize immensely if I misled anybody in this post. I should have told everybody sooner than now. Seeing so many redditors come out and mutually celebrating not only my birthday, but the birthdays of so many other redditors was too good of a feeling. I just didn't want to stop people from celebrating.   To any redditors who feel cheated by me, I am very, very sorry! Please continue to shower birthday wishes upon those who deserve it!   To any redditors whose birthdays are today (or tomorrow or any other day) and feel Forever Alone: You are not alone! You will always have the reddit community. You will likely have your family. You will likely have friends around you that you didn't realize. And if you don't, you can send me a message and I'll try call you up myself and wish you a happy birthday! (I apologize in advance if I am a day or two late.)

1	Except that he made this message on the PBE forum.  He believed that he had already solved the problem a few days ago and that it wouldn't make it to the Live server, but according to these comments it has.
0	Yeah ok, if you want to change the subject that's cool. It looks as if you kind of got my first point and if you're more interested in patting yourself on the back for not being one of those smug guys, whatever.  We weren't talking about those who go on this subreddit to get karma or to act superior, I thought you understood that from your first response. You've confused what I said and I think I'm the one to blame  because I don't really make myself too clear.  I'm not going to though because I found this.  "I live in the US. I don't doubt that some people have families that don't approve, although I absolutely doubt that people are getting expelled from school or fired from work (unless they willingly chose to go to school/work for a fanatical church, which would be their own fault) for privately not believing in god and not being a dick about it. r/atheism is just a joke though. I just went and every post was so ridiculous and smug it made my head hurt. I could not be more atheist, but can you seriously look at stuff like their 'Faces of Atheism' posts and not think that is ridiculous?"  It seams that you really don't give a shit about any of those people or the abuse atheists have to face in some communities. You'd rather get your jimmies rustled by the attention whores you could find anywhere in the world. If that's your calling that's fine, go get em. You made an ignorant comment and backed it up with "well these guys over here are annoying". I like to type, that's why I've gone so far to respond to you because if you want the short hand then here,
0	I'd just like to make a point... he's not making fun of atheists, who are not bad just because they're atheists... he's generalizing that every person subscribed to /r/atheism is part of the atheist supremacy circle jerk. However, I bet that a large portion of these people are decent people who just went there because in their real life they are alienated by a highly Christian community they live in, told that they don't deserve to live due to the fact that they have no faith. I'd say that's a good reason to want to escape. Temporarily, until they don't need it, /r/atheism is giving them a place to vent and discuss some injustice caused by religion. For example, many Christians (I am not generalizing here, there is a huge group of people who do this) use their religion to persecute homosexuals. My point here is that not everyone on that subreddit is an atheist supremacist asshole. Those are just the people who actively upvote in that subreddit, while most of the people trying to escape from their religious family/friends' persecution just lurk there.
1	I know exactly how you feel. After 2 heart attacks before I hit 23 (perfectly in shape, just odd heart defects) I've used LoL as an out for many things. Now I've taken all that I can and all the good things it's given me and tried to give back with my youtube channel. Granted it's nothing much and will most likely never break out, but it lets me do 3 things I love in one:     Play LoL     Teach (I'm a coach IRL and working on being a teacher)     Help people
1	I play Olaf most at top lane and/or jungle. I play Kog as AD Carry, but I can play him mid. Soraka is my main support. I pretty much suck with the others, with the slight exception of Nunu, who I am just now learning to play. My only mid that I am good at is Heim...but I don't do that ranked. I really never play mid in ranked. I need to practice that much much more often.

1	Never say that a team is 'unbeatable'... I thought that we had a game in the bag after I got nidalee, and my friends got Zilean, Kassadin, Gangplank and LeBlanc. We were whooping with joy when nobody dodged. Although we ended up with double the enemy team's kills (their Fiora was 5-25) their Annie landed a Tibbers and they got a lucky ace. We had no tank (gangplank wanted kills... Of course), and the enemies had a nunu as well as a tanky xin zhao. The xin managed to finish our nexus, we couldn't dish out enough damage to stop him.
1	Given how hard it is to create a  true  random number generator in programming, chances are the algorithm that ARAM uses probably isn't entirely random to begin with. Furthermore, changing the team comp. algorithm seems to me to be the best way to get fewer people to leave the game without dishing out penalties. The only problem (and admittingly a big one) is that people may disagree on when the algorithm should intervene with champion select. That problem aside, a good randomness algorithm would merely randomly select everyone's champions continually until a good match has been found. So, as long as the algorithm only intervenes in scenarios where one team  drastically  outmatches the other, I don't see why such an idea has to be downvoted without debate.
1	Some months ago a bug (or something else, I don't know what caused it) enabled us to play 6v6 on TT and the whole game usually transformed into a huge brawl. It was the fun of a lifetime but it has been patched and is no longer possible to do, as fas as I know. I even saw lobbies of 10v10 or 12v12 but those games needed everybody in the lobby to change some file in your LoL folder to work so those games usually never started.
1	I think it really needs to implement some kind of white or black list of champs.  I think most heroes are viable but it really sucks when you get stuck with someone like Trynd or Fiora and just get destroyed the whole game.  Also, it somewhat punishes players who own more champs than others as there is more barrier to success than those who only own champs they're good with.
1	r/starcraft]( is actually waaay better then this reddit because:     No circlejerking   More mature discussions   More active mods     AND FYI for people that want to discuss current state of game and get help with the game:   [/r/allthingsprotoss](   [/r/AllThingsTerran](   [/r/allthingszerg](   [/r/starcraft_strategy](   I personally believe that the League reddit should be only about e-sports and patch notes, awesome gameplays etcetera and that subreddits is a place for AMA, guides, streams, champion discussions and other interesting things so you actually can filter out the crap you don't want to read.
1	As opposed to what?   "Do any other junglers just HATE it when their lanes lose?"  "I hate it when my AD carry thinks sitting behind them healing is sub-par support play!"  "Hey guys I have a totally underrated build for Maokai: Mobility Boots, Bloodrazor, Phantom Dancer! It's OP!"  "Rumble could really use some buffs right now. I played him once and lost the lane."   The discourse on this subreddit is fucking appauling. The people who submit content 9/10 times are being paid to do so, the majority of people discussing the game are very low elo who say things that are simply false, and the rest of it is fan art.   /r/starcraft is fucking incredible relative to this shitty subreddit. Results in recent professional games (it's sad LoL's pro community is too unprofessional to play real games on a timely basis and instead just grind solo queue all day), LAN events, and true characters. Team switches, recent events, recent patches, champion spotlights, interviews,  news ...that is the shit relative to this subreddit.   If you want to learn how to play a champion, ask yourself: is a professionally-written guide on solomid.net still relevant? If yes, shut the fuck up and go read the guide. If no, ask the community for what has changed in the patch or two since the guide was written.   If you have a suggestion for the game, ask yourself: how long have I been reading this subreddit? If it's less than one month,  shut the fuck up . Your suggestion has already been posted at least three thousand times. This includes, but is not limited to:   1) No elo loss in 4v5s.  2) Commendations.  3) Achievements.  4) Skin suggestions (if I read about bowling ball Malphite one more time, I swear to god I will come at you. With everything I've got).   Further more, if you are submitting a post, don't say "Just a suggestion!" or, "This is why I love Riot".   Finally, the most important point of all: downvote blog spam. 99% of content submitted by Dignitas, SK, DiffTheEnder, Elementz, Stonewall_008, Travis, Comely, and all the other 'personalities' on this subreddit is only out there to drive page views and subscriptions. If there is some  news-worthy  article or event or something pertinent to  right now , yeah sure submit it and upvote it.   "Hey guys, there's a big Korean tournament coming up and I, well-liked community figure, need your help getting there" = okay.  "Hey guys, well-liked community figure here with an article on how to stay calm in solo queue" = not okay.   If you're some [blog spamming asshole]( whose job is to drive hits to the website, head [here]( and take out an advertise targeted on /r/leagueoflegends instead of promoting your crappy content nobody bothers to read in the first place. This subreddit is not an RSS feed for your blog's content, it is not a subscription feature for your YouTube channel.
1	Well /r/leagueoflegends isnt`t that bad, but I get what you mean. I took a look at /r/starcraft and it was really boring tbh. Let there be posts about esports and celebrity, but also keep the fan made stuff :) I am here for info but also for the LOLS :)
0	Don't they address this issue in TDK? (I only vaguely remember this scene, it might be in BB) Somebody comes to Lucius trying to blackmail Batman for money because he basically figures out that Batman is getting his gear from applied sciences and Lucius simply replies to him by asking him if he is trying to blackmail a person who beats up criminal in his spare time. That comment is enough to keep the man from leaking the information. I feel that this would be enough to keep the people of applied sciences quiet for they would almost certainly figure this out, that if any of them squeal Batman may come to silence them. After all the public view of Batman is crazy vigilante.
1	nahhh, her mana costs meant she was doing what other supports were doing but then running out of mana.   i did the math a while back and her sustain was the most mana-costly excepting Taric, who isn't picked for his sustain but for his all-in with hard CC and armor shred.   the weakness of Sona was that if you poked even just a little bit and forced her to sustain with W, she would run out of mana to poke with Q + power chord. then she'd become a lackluster passive sustain support.   she was overnerfed (Nautilus patch, #134) then buffed back to viability. IMO the bigger patch was #142 (mana cost of Q Changed to 45/50/55/60/65 from 65) and not #143 (QoL changes).   FWIW, the 'over-dramatized changes' were:   Power Chord damage adjusted to 10 per level from 14+9 per level.  Hymn of Valor passive attack damage and ability power aura reduced at earlier ranks to 4/8/12/16/20 from 8/11/14/17/20.  Aria of Perseverance passive armor and magic resist aura reduced at earlier ranks to 3/6/9/12/15 from 7/9/11/13/15.  Song of Celerity passive movement speed aura reduced at earlier ranks to 4/8/12/16/20 from 8/11/14/17/20.
1	Biggest piece of advice I would give anyone would be not to let frustration get the better of you. There are so many keyboard warriors on League that just wait for you to make a mistake and then bitch about it for the rest of the game. Just play the game, and if someone makes a mistake, keep playing, you would be surprised by how easy can be to comeback in a game of League sometimes.
1	Just work on improving your own skills last hitting map awareness and positioning. Dont worry too much about your team mates and if you do give them advice do it in a nice way. Also dont get phased when a team mate or enemy bashes you in chat there will always be trolls. Dont feed the trolls it only fuels them and detracts from your focus. You will win some and lose some dont let your fear of losing elo discourage you from playing. If you hit a long losing streak maybe take a break and assess what you might be doing wrong and work on it.
1	Correct, top lane he has his counters, but I see him beating a lot more people there than in mid.  He's situational in both lanes but is more comfortable top but more potential in mid.   Yeah, CLG really gave the opportunity for IG to run Master Yi, it was unexpected too for them.   I would pick Master Yi over Akali or Katarina because he can win different lanes that Akali can't, he can also get the job done quicker and potentially cleaner while Akali or Katarina would be clearly better in more situations than Yi would be.  CLG left a door wide open, low CC count, they couldn't stop Yi, and with Jarvan just being such a great partner for Yi, closing people up and being able to burst primary targets quickly and leaving Yi to finish them off and get AoE damage and a refreshed Q, IG was able to abuse the opportunity that CLG gave them.
0	This reminds me of a pretty funny story. My grandma has been a hairdresser for over 40 years and owns a hair salon. She normally does all of my haircuts for me, or has someone who works at her salon do them. I was spending some time with her one day and for whatever reason (i forget) she wanted me to get a haircut. The salon she owns was being remodeled so she took me to an Aveda hair salon.   While having my hair cut my grandma made a simple polite comment about something she wanted done with my hair. (something along the lines of "could you shorten 'this' up a little bit) This immediately set the hair stylist off into bitch mode. The stylist said it would look horrible if she did what my grandma had said. The stylist went on an arrogant tangent about how she was the "trained professional" and that my grandma should trust her "better judgement".   That was the first time I had ever heard my sweet old grandma swear. She called the stylist a bitch, very loudly in front of about 20 people in the Salon. My grandma then proceeded to let the stylist know about every mistake she made and that my grandma was a hairdresser for 40 years and owned a salon for 30+ years.   We ended up walking out without paying as a manager apologized about the stylist's behavior.
0	I had some luscious long hair. My mom pointed me in the direction of her Asian hairstylist. Yes the fact that she's Asian plays a big part. So I went see her and tell her I want a mullet cut (Johnny Craig is my man crush and he has a rockin mullet, look him up if you don't know). She repeats it back "yu wan e muleet rie." I'm like, "you know it, bringin back the 80s." She then proceeds to take clippers with the smallest guard possible, and starts shaving the party portion of my hair. I'm thinking in my head, "okay, this is a weird mullet cut, but hey, she's the stylist." To cut down on time, she cut my hair to some non-mullet fohawk douchey looking shit. "So yu lie yu muleet?". "Yea, it looks good, here's a 20."
1	Here is the issue with your build:   Trying to catch the axes late game is poor play.   If you let the falling axes dictate your positioning you will lose teamfights left and right. It makes you predicable and puts you in less than ideal positions.   Getting an extra bloodthrister rather than a PD will really hurt you by lategame. Having 400 damage and 1 attack speed is far inferior to 2 attack speed and 300 damage (without even considering the bonus crit from PD). And even if you are catching your axes you will do less damage than someone who builds a normal AD carry build and doesn't bother to catch the axes.
0	I know that hurt, bro.   When I was in high school a girl I knew asked if I could tutor her in Spanish. I said, "Well, I'm getting an A but I really am not very good at Spanish."  A week or so later she told me during school that she wanted to hang out with me that afternoon and was going to come over.  I laughed it off.  She came over and I told her that I was going to see The Day After Tomorrow with some friends.  She walked home.  We didn't really talk after that.
0	i was the same, 22 now and i go alright with girls. Once i started going out a bit i found it didn't take much effort to pick up girls, and it just got easier and easier as i realised more and more that some girls are actually attracted to me. I don't go out with the desperate intention of picking up, it's more like if it happens it's a bonus. but it happens fairly frequently. at 19 i think i'd kissed about 4 girls. 3 and a half years later that number is probably in triple digits now. still never had a girlfriend, but that's because i shit bricks and run whenever things get remotely close to being a relationship.
0	I feel awkward looking at this. I felt the opposite, and this turned out to be true. I thought I was only kinda cute (still feel that way) but it turns out that lots of guys liked me. And people think I'm rather attractive. -shrugs-
1	Because, Curse picks differently. They don't pick the most overpowered heroes like most teams, it's just the way they pick/play. They pick heroes they are comfortable with. Nyjacky's Morgana, Westrice on Darius, Cop on Corki, etc. They're picking what they are comfortable with.
1	This is not a bug. This is intentional... Channeled skills (even if it's a short channel) take up your champion's time. You can't do anything else during the channel (besides possibly use summoners). This includes things as deliberate as nunu ult and things as small as pantheon's spear toss. Let's look at an example:   Tristana's rocket jump. There is a brief channel (about a half a second or less) at the beginning of the jump. During this time you cannot auto attack or cast e or ult (not sure about q since it's not a channel). As soon as she begins to leap into the air, she is no longer channeling, thus she can use her autos and abilities.   You can distinguish channeled abilities by a (sometimes very quick) channel bar that appears on the screen above your skills. In addition, all channeled abilities stop your movement. This was the change they made with Rengar. Instead of making it a channeled spell that stopped his movement, they made it castable while running. It wasn't a  bugfix , it was a  change .
0	OP, your point is well taken, and I think you're touching on something that fundamentally differentiates American football from association football (which I will henceforth refer as "soccer" in order to avoid confusion).  Soccer fans seem to be much more inclined to accept the theatrics of the sport: bad calls, missed calls, dives, etc.  Deception, at times, is part of the game, and, frankly, it's often rewarded.   American football fans have zero tolerance for this.  Fans expect absolute truth and impartiality when it comes to officiating.  It's part of the reason the sport has such and extensive review and challenge process.  This is not to say there isn't genuine outrage over bad calls that are made in soccer.  Of course there is.  But the sport has opted not to implement replays and reviews for a variety of reasons, and in doing so there's a sense of tacit acceptance of the status quo.   This mentality might be part of the reason that soccer hasn't completely caught on in the States at the professional level like it has in other parts of the world.  I really like soccer, but I'm genuinely turned off every time I see someone take a dive or fake an injury to run down the clock (the latter occasionally happens in American football, but not nearly to the extent that it does in soccer).  I recognize that this sentiment isn't unique to Americans, but I think it irks us more than others.  Americans get acquainted with soccer theatrics every four years, and it tends to leave a poor taste in our mouths.  In fact, Nike even ran [a pro-U.S. ad back in 2010]( thanking the American team for not resorting to diving.
1	imo riot doesn't want to alienate the asian (korea/china) players. as much as we're raising pitchforks here some WE/AF fanatics in their home country just might kick up a fuss as well if they are DQed especially if WE/AF steadfastly maintain their innocence to their fans.   also i think crs/dig collusion was them agreeing to split the #1 and #2 place prize money regardless of who won and were overheard by someone when they were discussing it in some cafe.
0	I was a nice guy back in high school. I never realized how much I fucked up with girls because I think I was in love with the idea of having a girlfriend and never getting to appreciate that I was talking to someone. I can't lie and say that I never got upset when a girl said no, because being rejected sucks. I also never paid attention to girls who did show interest in me since I "didn't want them" and aimed higher than something more meaningful.   You don't realize how much of an asshole you are until you're older and it hits you that maybe you put too much stock into what other people thought, or you're so up your own ass about what you'd like that you could have had it with someone else. I got lucky since I found someone who was my type and thensome. Been married for 2 years. When you stop trying to "be nice" and be yourself, it works wonders. These "nice guys" need to realize this, but they have to come to that realization on their own. I can't get upset at these guys because they're not at that point where they understand there's more to relationships than being what you think someone wants you to be. I can, however, get mad at guys that think it's cool to slander a girl's reputation or make her feel like shit because you didn't get what you want. Those guys have a lot of growing up to do.
0	As a chick who can't stand chicks, I used to hear women talking about how they were just friends and it hurt a little seeing all of these guys in the friend-zone. They weren't clingy, insecure, or anything that I could see; the women just liked having guys who would compliment them/be there for them but wouldn't date them because they didn't like the way they looked or just wanted the boyfriend flattery and then going out to get with other guys.
0	Just want to say, eHarmony is shit. Women within 5 years of my age (21) and in my entire state and surrounding area (Wisconsin) simply do not give fucks (figuratively, of course). I received maybe 3 responses ever when sending messages, and only 1 woman initiated conversation EDIT: in a year. Source: my parents paid for an account for my birthday.
0	Well that was less than a year ago so that is definitely a spoiler.
1	Jiji used to regularly get at least 3k viewers, so it is probable that a large amount of his current group of viewers are fans. Chauster did not stream as frequently as Jiji and when he did, he didn't get as many views.
1	I agree with what Elementz did but the biggest reason why Chauster's reputation went down was because he cheated by playing on his girlfriend's account (Missy) in a Girl4LoL tournament and he claimed Missy was a better support than Elementz when she got carried to like 1800 by every CLG member. At best she was a 1200 player.
0	Don't take her advice.   Just use common sense. Having a three texts a day rule is fucking stupid.   Take care when your texting a girl to make sure you come across as not needy and no overly attached, but still interested and you're fine.  This means that if she's waiting 30 min to respond to all your texts you best not be responding immediately to ALL of hers, though you should to one after you've delayed a few just to show that you really aren't planning the delays, but living your busy life and they are just happening (even though you really are planning them).   Don't monitor it at all and you will always fuck it up, every time, cuz as a guy you are usually going to be much more into her at the start than she into you. Allowing your true emotions to manifest too quickly will always fuck the situation over. Always.   Note: once she's your girlfriend the rule changes. Being nonneedy is still important, but her feeling like she is important to you and valued and loved is more important and it's why the girl above me dumped her bf for his dumbass 3 text rule. (also she did it because his patten was too obvious and the pattern itself, though designed to make him look smooth actually showed her how nervous he truly was. And it killed the attraction.)
0	Don't feel bad. I get lots of girls and I still do this. Thing is, when you are first texting a girl you have to be VERY careful about how you come across, to the point of timing your replies because girls read into everything and as soon as they start to think you like them too much they will stop being into you. You have to intentionally go out of your way to communicate nonneediness.
0	I assume anyone who thinks these rules are still important once they're an adult is not worth dating. It's a filtering mechanism designed to avoid later on having to listen to horoscopes or whatever other bullshit they'd deem important. I'd rather date someone who's smart.
1	Get a dictionary and look up the definition of mechanic.  It does not exclusively refer to a person of a specific occupation.   Perhaps at one time, this might have been considered incorrect, but language evolves.  Example - RaDAR.  It was just an acronym for a long time, but eventually as it became a household term, it was coined as an official word (iirc sometime in the 80s).
1	Realistically, you should get another job and work on casting/E-sports on the side.  If you are indeed on your own, then E-Sports will not pay the bills right off the bat.  Many of the people who are able to play a role in E-Sports have long gaming backgrounds and have been involved in multiple games.  There have been competitions to find amateur casters that you should be participating in.   Realistically, you will not find instant success that will pay your bills and rent no matter how much reddit sympathizes with your circumstances in life.  If you're serious about this, then you better get some income while trying to chase this dream.  You work at this 40 hours a week and you work another job 40 hours a week.  That's right, that's 80 hours of work a week.  If you're really serious and really passionate about trying to succeed you will need at  least  that much.   I look at Travis from SotL and he does not impress me at all.  I used to watch some SotLs, but he would make his show notes in the beginning of the show.  If you want me to take a show seriously, then it should be somewhat professional.  It should not be something you're typing up 5 minutes before you start.
1	This whole thing screams scam/fake. You don't  actually elaborate what you want to do in E-Sports nor what you posses aside from passion, which is not very accurate either. You can't just say you have a passion for E-Sports, that is like saying you have a passion for Football. Do you like playing it? Watching it? What aspects and why?   You aren't telling us anything except for you sob story- which just seems like an attempt  to gain sympathy.  Also, all your comments have been so  kind  and  thankful  to the point of feeling fake and insincere. Also, all your comments have been so  kind  and  thankful  to the point of feeling fake and insincere. You just seem like you're trying to get a free ride/money.
1	Like I said. I come from SC2 where the games are considerably shorter, but yes, maybe it should be reduced to 1-2 games.   Besides the OP said he was around the 2k elo braket, by this I am judging that he has a lot of spare time to play the game.   And yes, I am still in "school." I am studying computer science degree at university. Despite this, I still manage to get in ~5 hours of gaming daily (most of which is in LoL) without it affecting my studies, my social life, or my sleeping pattern.
0	ESPN caters to the most popular as well as the "under-dogs", hence why you can see the 20 minutes of a N.Y Giants loss and how well Johnny Manziel played to beat a #1 ranked Alabama.   It's not that you hate Danica Patrick, albeit I spite her for the GoDaddy.com commercials, you hate ESPN because it forces you to watch crap you don't care to hear about much like how you hate seeing reposts on Reddit but you're still here.
0	Danica Patrick really really bothers me. I'm an avid motorsports fan and I constantly lament the fact that for whatever reason there are very few female racers, and ever fewer who are competitive.   When I first heard about Danica Patrick I was thrilled because I thought she could be one of the first women to really break into the sport in a meaningful way. Instead, she has been disappointing career-wise (e.g. she doesn't win very often), and has instead chosen to shill stupid crap using her body. To me, it indicates a lack of commitment to the sport.   I don't hate Danica Patrick because she's found a way to make money using her sex appeal, I hate her because she blew an opportunity to make a major impact for women in motorsports.
1	Well sorry, but i didnt want to read the whole post so i just read the
1	I am similar to the guy that drug described. i keep the same mentality that drug's friend holds. however, i suffer from an illness that keeps me from performing at my best and consistently. because of my illness i deem myself unfit to play ranked and do not do so accordingly. many times i will not even start a ranked blind because i know i cant perform to the standard of my normal queue. however it really kills me when people just flip out and flame. i play this game for fun and a way to take my mind off things and some days when i am feeling shit all i feel like doing is sitting down and playing 1 match on summoners rift. this form of relaxation is immediately destroyed by rage and flamers. i would love to see this epiphany form more commonly in the league.
1	If you want in depth explanations for both matchups, check out goldfather8's guide to riven on solomid.net. I can't access it right now but I will link it when I can get into the site.  Until then, I'll do my best to explain both. Olaf is actually a manageable lane for Riven (let's be honest, all lanes are for her). The key is baiting and timing your e in such a way as to blow his e for free, as well as to make him spend mana, because this is what you have over him - you outsustain him as a non-mana based champion. Be very careful about all inning him, as he can fight back very well. A trick you can use, should an all in go awry, is to flash out after he exhausts, pops ult, or what have you. As he chases (and he will chase), wait until his ult, w, or whatever else he popped drops, and turn on him with your full combo. The lane requires you to outplay him, but it is definitely playable.   As far as Garen, again you will want to abuse your e as much as possible. Make sure to use it before his silence lands, and kite out of his spin as quickly as you can. The goal here is to bait out his skills before going on him with your standard harass combo (1 q in, w, finish q combo, e out), and if you can do this more than once then the lane will begin to move in your favor. Be very careful when he hits level 6 though.Once you have farmed a bloodthirster, you will begin winning the lane, but it is still very difficult depending on how Garen chooses to build.
1	Any role can theoretically carry.  A support with awesome ability can turn a team of below average players into a victory.  A blitzcrank that lands clutch pulls, a Soraka that lands clutch heals, a Janna that controls engagements there are countless ways supports can make a difference.   You are right though, Support is probably the least carrying.  If I had to rank them I would go Jungle>Top>Mid>ADC>Support.   That being said it sort of depends on the champion more than the role.  Lee Sin in the jungle can carry a team of just about anything to victory because of how powerful he is early.  On the other hand, tanky support junglers like Maokai have trouble with that because they depend on their team to fufill their roles.
1	I disagree with this, I think that 75 would have been a better number. At 60, I don't think people will go for it anymore, instead opting for RoA for regen, beefiness, and the same amount of AP. 75 would be a good option, 15 extra AP and some extra mana regen vs health, it's a good trade off.   I also think that chalice should build into something like manamune. RIP the days of Manamune Corki, and varying AD builds instead of Rush IE, rush BT, rush Triforce. Also, I want dorans and pot back. That was sweet.
1	5/6th is relative. Look at who they faced and their draw and the teams they placed ahead of and who they drew. Plain fact is that they can hang their hat on beating Curse.EU who got knocked out by Curse.NA.   What else can you pull from this? They lost better than they would have lost before? You are being a twat just as much.   Keep hanging onto that 5/6. You can bring it up in all the dick measuring threads about the NA scene until the next big tournament. Meanwhile, NA is woefully behind in meta and are not as studious as the other regions. S3 is only going to wreck NA more because EU and Korea will have the kinks worked out far before NA. The whole grasping onto crap like 5/6 and missing the bigger picture is just showing the issues with NA teams and fans.
1	As an east coast American, 200 ping.
1	Flash is a good spell for all the utility it provides. There is almost no case where taking flash will be a bad choice. It allows you to close gaps on any champion and is an extremely versatile escape spell. With spells like clarity and clairvoyance, you have a really good early game advantage, but the other team can do basically what those spells can do by building correctly.
0	Because when bad things happen, people like to fix blame on someone or something. Specifically, someone or something they don't like or don't necessarily fully understand. They can blame drugs, religion, lack of religion, video games movies, parenting, culture, etc. But it's never, or very rarely, ALL drugs, or religions, or video games, or parenting skills, etc. It's the drugs they don't take, the religions they don't follow, the video games they don't play, or a parenting method they don't follow. It's a lot more comforting being able to convince yourself that it could never be YOUR kid who bullies a kid into suicide or goes on a shooting spree, and as long as the causes can be grossly over simplified and blame can be placed on something that doesn't cause you to change or open your mind, people will continue to blame violence on people or things that are, at best, only vaguely connected to the crime.
0	Dude. We went to the Avengers premiere, my buddies and I.   You would think that everyone else there at a midnight showing would also be huge fans; and to their credit, some were.   When Bruce Banner is all like "My secret? I'm always angry." Then Hulks up and smashes the giant monster flier thing in a blaze of motherfuckin glory we all cheered and clapped "Fuck yes! Oh hell yeah!" And were applauding.   Like two other people in the crowded theater seemed moderately impressed at that awesome movie.
0	I personally enjoy how rambunctious American theaters are. I spent a summer living with a host family in Japan between high school and college. Up until that point I was reasonably sure that I wanted to live in Japan. I had had the greatest time of my life until one day I recognized that I had no place in their society and that I needed to leave as soon as possible.   I went to go see the 300 in theater's there. I had watched The 300 in American theater's before leaving for Japan and it was one of the greatest cinematic experiences of my life, trumped only by the opening night of Snakes on a Plane. There was cheering, yelling, clapping, manly grunting, and horns thrown throughout the movie from the whole audience. After the movie two people felt so testosterone filled from the movie they fought in the parking lot for no reason other than the experience of it and became great friends afterwards.   The Japanese experience was...different to say the least. The theater was sold out and packed. Not a single person made a sound throughout the entire movie. Everyone sat and stared face forward. There was no clapping, no cheering, not even a gasp or a laugh uttered throughout the whole thing. I couldn't believe it. I then thought back to all the times people told me to be quieter, to not laugh so loud, to be less...American while I had been there. It fit. Japan was too subdued. I couldn't live there. I had to come to America where we are free to express ourselves at the screen.   If you don't like people getting into the movie then watch at home or go to Japan. I go to a theater or out in public in general as a social experience and I treasure those small interactions that you don't get elsewhere in the world.
0	Storytime! I met this girl at a small birthday party thing, we ended up singing random classic rock song duets. Meet up several times in the next few months, turns out music is pretty much the only common interest, so we just trade music a lot online. A couple of months later she gets engaged (o0), which is fine as neither of us ever brought up dating (though it did cross my mind a few times).   End of the story is her sister is a tri-lingual book nerd with a wit you could use for shaving. Oh, and her parents really like me so I've been invited to stay at their house for a family weekend later this month.
1	to everyone saying 'no', i dont think they have experience playing it correctly.  I love watching Voyboy play Kat top.  Now, dont expect to be as successful as he is, but you should try it.  Go 9/21/0, build tanky and post lvl 6 always carry a ward so you can escape jungle camp sessions.   My biggest issue is that while she is viable top, she's not great, and she's not better at it than when she goes mid.
0	This is funny because awhile ago I was in Seattle hanging out at the UW and I had just missed my bus home, at the school. So what I did was I went into an all out sprint to the otherside of the U-District to try to reach the final stop of the bus before it hit the freeway. So I'm running in the rain, feeling pretty badass that I've caught up to the bus, when this little old lady needs help across the street. The wind was picking up and the rain was thundering down on the two of us, and instead of sprinting up to catch the bus... I helped the little old lady across the street, guiding her with her walker.   I missed the bus, waited an hour for another bus that I could take. Got a hug from a little old lady.   It doesn't seem like much, but I happy that I did it.
0	In NJ, on a multi lane road, you MUST keep right of the leftmost lane except to pass or to move to the left if there is an emergency vehicle on the right shoulder with its emergency lights on.  You can be issued a ticket for failing to observe this law.
0	sigh  so my drive into work today - it's as if someone knew I made these posts and pulled this shit. There is an exit in the passing lane on the way to work, but it's accessible by the middle lane too. Of course the slow guys use the left-most lane because it makes their merge onto the next highway easy.....but they don't need to get in that lane 5 miles before the exit...
1	Different types of aggressive. If they are over extending the lane all of a sudden, someone else is generally somewhere in range. If the jungler is set up for the gank, the laner will try and bait you towards a brush with the jungler, or let you over extend so they can perform a pincer gank. If they let the lane fall back, stay just a bit out of range, as to keep the jungler's attention for the most amount of time, getting whatever CS you can without a chance of dying. The jungler will often go off to another lane, recognizing that you are anticipating a gank and the laner will go back to regular play.   A good laner will not show signs, other than maybe subtly maneuvering the creep wave and the fight towards one side of the lane. But that doesn't mean that the jungler is on that side. There are too many possibilities.   Wards can almost eliminate ganks. [Here is an in depth guide.](   [
1	Honestly, I dislike Athene in this community though as you said he's a great assets to gamers because of his charity. But what people don't get is that if he gets shunned from League of Legends, he'll probably just move on to a different game.   If we could get him to move to a single player game that would be absolutely fantastic. His current problem is that he's a pain in the ass and ruins the game for whoever he's with. In a single player game he wouldn't be able to ruin anyone's experience except the person he's playing against, and as it would net them a win they won't mind as much and his stream fans would still enjoy all his little quirks and things
1	I think you don't understand how Athene works. I agree that shunning him will somewhat encourage his behavior, but if he loses enough viewers he'll move on.   You can't make someone like that a positive member of the community, it's not possible frankly BECAUSE of the community. People like what he does. He has his own fan base that aren't from League of Legends, they just follow him to every game he plays. So shun him, accept him, he's got it made, he'll still have his core fans, and he won't change. Other scenes have come to respect him, worship him even, and he continued to screw people over, he didn't change. There's no reason to think he'll change now.
1	Ahri is really good at diving the back line, and if she can land her charm, it will make or break a fight.  Her farming is a bit tough early game (doesn't have a quick lane clear early game).   Ori is my personal favorite AP mid atm.  Her early game is a bit boring if you go chalice (which I recommend).  Once you get a chalice on her, you can harass as much as you want and still farm very, very, very easily.  Late game, with an Athene's, you can harass so easily, as all of her cooldowns are very short.  Back lines FEAR Orianna's ball and you can easily drop an ADC or squishy APC, as well as chunk most bruisers.  Her shield is amazing late game, shielding for something like 500 damage, doing damage on the way to it's target, as long as like a 5-8 second cooldown late game (depending on your cdr)   Orianna can combo amazingly with any diver.  Malphite ult into Ori ult, awesome.  Amumu ult? Same thing.   ~ ~ ~
1	You are implying said people are playing to win, and in the end league of legends is a game and people can enjoy it how they so wish. Problem with LoL is there really isn't a "let's just fuck around queue' other than Arams(?) so these people who want to play the game in a different way will end up against players who are taking it seriously or playing the 'objective'.   Take Call of Duty for example. A game type like domination, I have no interest in capping any kind of flag, I just want to kill people for a bit, the end result I care little. Maybe that will help you to realise the mindset here.   (I'm not saying it's right or wrong, that isn't my concern)
1	I'm expecting Own3d.tv to be out of buisness pretty soon. A LARGE majority of their streamers are now on twitch. The Rain Man, Destiny, Phantomlord, Guardsmanbob (as of today) and CLG.EU. Currently on the own3d.tv homepage the totals for all the streams is around 12k. Right now on twitch the two highest viewed streamers are both ABOVE 12k. (Froggen at 27k, TotalBiscuit at 12,600).   It's sad to see the website slowly dying. Although there's a lot of things own3d failed with. Such as late payments (Which caused TSM to switch in the first place) and destiny to even leave his contract early just so he can move to twitch and actually get paid. [You can read more about that here:  ] It's pretty sad since I used to always check own3d for my League streams and stayed almost exclusively on twitch for SC2 streams. Now there's almost no reason for me to even visit own3d once CLG makes the switch.
1	you are mixing up something. the flame for twitch was all about their stream quality - their stream lags/framedrops. twitch got a lot better now, but sometimes the good old problems seem to appear again.   the hatred concerning own3d started a long long time ago - i guess right when TSM switched to twitch. own3d has been paying their streamers with some huge delay.
1	Ill be honest i call bs on the 2nd part of the video. I'm not an athene follower nor do i care much about what he has done in other games.(first time i heard of him was when he did a youtube video where he went around down telling people he was a paladin or something)  I think doing things for charity is very helpful. I watched his stream this morning for about 5-10 minutes before i had to turn it off because his attitude was shitty. he just started a game playing ryze, few minutes in he self proclaimed himself the best gamer in the world and was telling the stream something about him csing all day. He goes back to buy at lvl 4, teleported to a bot ward in a bush to gank. The bliz did not grab the enemy adc even though it was a perfect grab. Athene didn't didn't know this and totally calls out the blitz on stream saying he is the worst blitz eu. After athene told the blitz it was a easy grab the blitz responds with the grab was on cd. He runs back to his tower and comments on how now his tower is almost dead.(athene still being lvl 4 vs a karthus)   I'm not judging him on anything accept those 5-10 minutes of the game and in that short time i understood why people would "troll" him. Regardless if he had the right idea or best intentions when ganking he could of waited until lvl 6 where he was sure to get a kill.   If thats his attitude in every game all game then its understandable why he has stopped gaining elo. You cannot claim to be the best gamer in the world but in the same game blame everything on everyone else because "oh i'm famous". If You get your 2 main champs banned out become good at other champs. Don't give excuses like "they will just feed" or "everyone is out to get me". Guess what maybe you are not the best league player in the world who cares. You may have been a good wow player but you will not be good at every game you play. Stop going into the science about how people think and improve yourself.
1	The only thing I'm damaging is his shitty ego if he wants to give to charity he will either way, if he wants to reach higher elo he'll simply name change and not stream. The only reason he gives to charity is so he gets out of that shit storm he's in, so he has a way to excuse himself so people at least feel sorry for him.   If I told you that I've given to charity will it make either of my points more valid?
1	Once i did a game with a friend and he checks a pantheon player on lolking, that player had 200+ games played with only pantheon and he owned us.   Now aside from that yes Athene plays 2 champs but he said in his vid that he "can" play multiple champs that, that isn't the problem.   And here i want a reply from you guys: I don't understand why you guys complain that he plays two champs?   Multiple "pro" players and "famous" streamers play one or two champs alot. Like Dyrus with his Zed/Yorick testing or TRM with his kassadin plays.   It's just the same but a different situation.   The difference is you guys just hate Athene that's all.
1	I don't understand the comments in this thread. Basically, it looks like:     People raging about Athene even being here and calling, in bold font or capital letters, for people to downvote: Seriously? Calling for downvotes? Can't you just downvote and move on?     People saying that he avoids TRM's statement by talking about psychology: Ok, so basically, Athene wastes a long part of his video with his psychological stuff which is not relevant to what TRM says, but Athene never pretended that it was. He just wants a chance that the haters like those from my previous point give him a chance and listen to what he has to say. Obviously, it was a useless attempt and he should have gone straight to the point: haters didn't even watch the video or use the fact that he spends a lot of time talking about psychology to completely disregard the fact that he does answer TRM's statement.     A minority of people who actually watched the video and listened to the actual answer. These guys may agree or disagree with Athene, it doesn't really matter, the thing is, they are the only ones who should post here.       So, I'm now talking to the 3rd category only because there is no arguing with people who didn't properly watch the video. What Athene first says is that TRM's point was basically "Everybody has trolls, therefore everybody's Elo is lowered by trolls the same way, and it comes down to what you can do to carry your team through that". I think everybody agrees on that. His counter-argument is that when he streams, it increases the number of trolls he gets because haters who watch his stream queue at the same time just to troll him.   Now, maybe this is true, maybe this isn't.     If this is not true, well, either he thinks it's true and doesn't realize how many trolls there are not just for him but for everybody (then well, he should make a smurf and see how it goes), or he knows that but he's just making up excuses.     However if this is true (and this is made believable by the amount of automatic hate he gets in this thread from people who don't really seem to have anything better than to just order the community to hate Athene in every Athene thread that pops up), he should ask the Diamond players that agree that he gets more trolls than he should to say something about it, or maybe just get statistics of the picks and bans he gets.       My opinion is that I do think that there is a part of truth in what he says. I am pretty sure that there are some people who do queue at the same time as he does just to troll him, and people who troll him in champ select just because it is him. These people do have a negative impact on his Elo because they are not the average troll everyone gets: they are some "additional" trolls. That being said, his attitude in champ select can be pretty bad (at least sometimes, I have no idea how often it happens), he should have learned more champions for a long time, and he obviously doesn't deserve Diamond. Whether he could be carried to Diamond if he played more champions and if he had the same amount of trolls as anyone else, I don't know, I'm not sure he could be carried to Diamond anyway, but I am pretty convinced that Diamond players should be able to carry him higher and that he does have a hard time with trolls.
1	As for the first part, I have to disagree with your outlook on it because I don't think it's that simple.  Let's say what Athene says was true, and that he gets a lot of trolls every day because he has a large hater-base.  If the sole intent of the troll is to make the game hard for him, then there are ever so many ways to make the game hard for him without leaving a trail of evidence for tribunal.  For example, banning his champions is not going to show up on tribunal, neither will summoner names for people to know that he's really Athene.  If a person doesn't get to ban his champions and goes into the game with their goal of making it harder for him to win in mind, they may play a champion that they aren't good at on purpose, or they may intentionally perform badly.  Tribunal will not be able to tell if they are "trolling" unless they make it obvious in the chat, in items, or have too many deaths, and it's really easy to get away with it if you aren't dumb about it.   I do agree that he should learn how to play other champions though.
1	A lot of great points are already brought up in this thread, but I do want to break down a few things. I don't really like athene, I don't really agree with him, but I want to improve the community:     Athene (the persona) is not as good as he thinks he is. This is on purpose, and while I don't agree with it, its his choice.   Athene (the persona) does troll some games. While I don't agree with it and I think its bannable, its the persona and thats how he's branded himself.   Athene (the player) is not bad at ryze anymore. His stats are improving, he is getting better with every game he plays, and I admire his dedication.   Athene (the player) has some good intentions. His mind is in the right spot sometimes.   Athene (the player) probably does get trolled a lot. And in reponse, he ends up trolling. He turns on his persona, and basically says "screw it I can't play the champs I am best with in ranked, so I might as well play for fun." Fun for him is trolling. Fun for him is money. Trolling for him gets him money.
1	First part of the video reminds me when someone picks lets say karma support or like amumu mid no matter what they do they are troll oh jungler gank you and you die "omfg report this fucking amumu troll"
1	Or just make it a real MOBA and make a map simply meant for FFA Combat.   But then again, this would cause an immense amount of balancing issues, as Darius vs Ashe 1v1 would not end up well. And late game ranged champs would have the huge advantage, opposed to many others.
1	My advice depends on how your ADC likes to play. Personally, as ADC, I like to farm it out because I know I can out farm and zone the other ADC. So I prefer a passive support to sustain me and to protect me. If you think your ADC might need a little help farming, it certainly helps to have a support that creates good harass. It takes the pressure off and gets some free farm, maybe even force a recall. But in my opinion, the best thing you can do as support is make your presence known. As blitz or leona, just you sitting in the bush, with the ability to create hard cc whenever you want is very scary for me as an ADC. If my support or jungler is not close, I will almost never approach bot bushes if they have a support with a lot of cc (blitz, taric, leona, sona ult, now thresh hook). So just letting them know you are there and paying attention is my biggest piece of advice. The other thing I recommend is learning how to peel your opponent off. If they start to get on your ADC, run to your teammate, and run circles around him. This makes it harder to auto attack the right target for the other ADC. I have played with supports in ranked that go straight for hard cc to protect me, but if they miss, or the other ADC flash to me, its over. Staying close is more important and increases your likelihood of keeping your guy in lane.
1	No, you're approaching this with the wrong attitude. You think normals don't matter, your teammate does. But the fact is, neither of you is right. You both need to accept that other players have different expectations.   In this case, the person who says in chat that "its just normals" is in the wrong, because they are intentionally provoking the other person into getting angry. If you didnt say "it's just normals", they can't rage at you for it. (They might rage at your for something else, but at least you're not arming them). And besides, what's the point of saying that you don't care? Do you think you get virtual cool points for not caring? (Sadly, you don't)
1	I recently leveled new account to EUNE since I moved my main to EUW and while leveling I noticed a lot of attitude from everyone that you should know the game completely. Of course I knew the game already but I still said sometimes when I made stupid mistakes I am not lvl 30 yet and they cut some slack for me. It was a lie but it resulted in better environment for rest of the game so no problem for me.   Though I would strongly recommend just ignoring everyone who is annoying and flaming in chat (And most of the time you lose nothing from ignoring them). If you are afraid that you will lose important information about team, just write in chat ignored "champion name" and don't reply at all, mostly they stop direct flaming as they think you can not see it. What I also did and do from time to time is that I try to defend player doing badly so that they know not everyone is against them.
1	I always hear about how people find toxic people in tons of their games, but I've rarely ever found someone that was actually being a jerk.  To be fair, I mostly just played bot games until 10 or so, so I probably avoided many smurfs that way, but I have also played a lot of normals and a fair bit of ranked, and have never had anyone get mad when I make a mistake (other than flinging someone the wrong way as Singed and getting people on my team killed, which kinda was a really dumb move on my part).  In ranked games (at about 1300 elo) people see  pretty chill in all my games.  I decided to jungle since no one else wanted to, even though I'm not that great.  The first time I try to gank, the other person took pretty much no damage, and second time I tried I died, and the other person escaped with low life.  Even though I felt bad about it, no one on my team really said anything too bad, and people even encouraged me, and told me not to give up.   That being said, I have had some humorous games where people were really creative in telling me that I was playing very bad.  "Hey, Riven, I bet you'd do pretty bad in a petting zoo...no feeding allowed there." or "You could end world hunger if you had gone 0/11 to Africa instead of MF."  Although they were insulting me, they were doing it in a lighthearted way that gave me a great laugh.
1	Once I got trashtalked by a wukong top when I ended up feeding my lane. I told him I messed up and that I'm not as pro as him and that I play normals for a reason. Suprisingly enough he apologized too and said he had been in so many games already where people would feed, like I did, but tell everyone they are trash, go afk or just intentionally feeding because "we can't win now GG noob lane feed riven 6/0".
1	why do people even make smurf accounts? I can understand high elo people doing it so they can play the game the love despite the high queue times, but they know low level people suck, so they dont trashtalk them (usually). But if you honestly think you are in the wrong elo and "all these trolls keep making me lose my games" then you are probably close to your "true" elo anyways.
1	My personal advice would be to actually just try to get used to it.  I know it's probably extremely frustrating and annoying to you but people will just be like that.  You just have to literally not care.  But I will have to agree it's a lot worse at lower levels for I have no idea why people would even intentionally play on their low level smurfs unless they've been banned and are re-leveling (which probably explains their attitude) or something.   Some of those flamers/ragers on your team might even just be little kids.  Like kids will always look for an excuse or blame you to justify any mistake they made so again, it's best just to not care.  As for legitimate criticism on your play, you really don't have to listen to any of it if it's bothering you.  You can always mute them or even just outright ignore it and focus on your own play to self improve.   I generally try to maintain a nice/positive attitude, or simply just not talk.  Whenever someone messes up I try not to say ANYTHING.  Could not just be their game, or they're simply bad but I'll try not to talk or provoke them.  It's frustrating seeing people endlessly feed or people shit talking you but whatever.   Although I'm no saint myself.  I'll have my random days of built up rage but generally I try to keep it myself.  I remember back when I was leveling I would be all nice and positive until someone insulted me, then I'd snap, but I've really really grown accustomed to just not care.  Nowadays if someone is plain out insulting me and I really don't feel like putting up for it I'll just straight up mute them instantly.   Anyways epic wall of text.  Didn't expect to write that much at all but whatever.  It'll get a bit better, but the player base in this game is so large that there will ALWAYS be ragers and shit talkers regardless of what level your account is, so again just not care.  Yeah it's really annoying but whatever, just keep playing and get better.   Good luck man and remember try to have fun d00d! :3
1	In early levels (like 1-15, maybe 1-20) I can see having a few genuinely new players.  But usually, after stomping a few games matchmaking will put you in games with other people who are likely smurfs.  I can safely expect almost every if not all players in my level 27 smurf's game to also be smurfs, but I'm not going to expect much out of them because they likely wouldn't be smurfing if they were actually good.   The smurfs  you're  getting matched with probably aren't much better than you are in the grand scheme of things, and they're probably just trying to get another account to level 30 to try to have another chance at placement... which they will again fail miserably at and likely end up at some abysmal sub-1200 rating.  Just know that you're still learning, while they're beyond help.   On the point of adding everyone to your ignore list at the start of the game, that's not a bad idea, even when playing ranked.  Feel free to do so.   Honestly, the only time I ever smurf is if I dodge a ranked game and still feel like playing, or if I want to play with a friend who doesn't have a 30 account yet and I don't want to have him play against a level 30 with a full set of runes/masteries while he has nothing.   The people who smurf just for a power trip of being able to beat little children should just be ignored.  You could easily get waaaaaaaay better than them just by taking like 2 days watching a good streamer, and taking note of everything they do and try to understand the reasoning behind it.   =
1	Personaly I found its level 1-10 that is filled with smurfs, most non-smurfs at that level simply play bots. Got a few smurfs for the same reason as you, to play with a friend who just started, but when  I personally just started, the friend who made me start made a smurf, and he wasn't particularly good, honestly from hes skills I would say he probably belonged to 800 elo, but from that, he told me the philosophy of a lot of players at that elo, they all think they don't belong there, and that they can't get out, so they make a new account to start back to 1200 elo, and of course has to level that account. So
0	if you get hacked once, im pretty sure the hacker could get your other password too, even if it was different.   If they hack you machine yes, but if they hack Sony/Twitter, they will just have that information.   >plus, if you used different passwords for everything, "someone could use the information they get from one account to compromise the other ones"   Very, very good point, but at least they would need to mine that information, and it might not all be available. The type of attack that worked on Mat Honan is not that common, and required some phone calls. Not a big amount of work, if it is just the same user/password, you've make it as easy as you can for them.   >

1	But then he wouldn't really be nasus anymore. Imo the thing that makes nasus nasus is the feeling of being weak early, but if he gets to farm for a while he will hit like a truck regardless of how everyone else is doing. Streamlining him would make him just another bruiser with an aoe ability, a cc ability, an aa modifier and a tanky ulti.   Imagine if they tried to make vayne or kogmaw or shaco balanced between early game and lategame, it would remove half the fun of those champions.
1	This is called pseudo-random distribution (or PRD) and is used for percentage chance effects in several games including dota 2.   You can read up on it [here]( but league does not use this system, meaning every autoattack rolls for a crit independently of previous attacks.
1	The new system does not reward the casual gamer at all... it favors the hardcore, "grinding" type of player.   Due to the "roadblock" that is currently set up to gain both tiers and divisions, it has become extremely difficult as a casual player to have an incentive to even continue playing.   RIOT dropped the ball by trying to make ranked a more "competitive" atmosphere, because in the process, they alienated the millions of casual gamers such as myself who simply don't have the time to grind out thousands of ranked games, but still enjoy the competitive atmosphere.   I already have 3 friends who have stopped playing altogether, finding themselves in the exact same situation you where; they said that it took them "too long" to get anywhere, and that they felt even more anxiety than they did playing last season.   You also have the issue of the V tier, and seeing as they can't be dropped, they troll the tier I's from the division below them to prevent them from getting to a higher division.
1	I think you need to account for the active. Its really the big flaw with the items balance as 10% of your max HP is just going to rip anything apart. The thinking of it is "oh only melee can abuse this" but unless its nothing but a range on range game something melee is going to bashing on a carry who has a botrk active to burn. Or your trist who has 0 issue jumping into a team...
0	I understand the point OP was making. We're not getting killed in our sleep or anything but that doesn't mean our freedoms aren't being taken away.   I don't go on rambling about how tough life is in America to people from Uganda but I can still voice my concerns about my countries government. I still would rather live in America than a third world country though.
0	This is the kind of thing that is hilarious, but would make absolute zero sense to anyone who's not on reddit
1	I recently got promoted to Platinum V and was enthusiastic at first. I still got up to 30 LP per Win and only -15 per Loss. Great times; but stuff went down the drain. I eventually lost 11 out of 14 matches, regardless of how I did (I obviously lost my lane a lot, too). Simply every lane lost, the last lane standing was then camped by the enemy jungler. Dire times. However, I ain't even mad; Shit happens. As a substitution, I found myself playing ARAM with friends a lot recently, and also some normals. Great fun! Releases pressure and I suppose im going to start ranked in a week or so. Hoping for some good karma then, maybe Im granted a 11 Win / 3 Loss streak!
1	I hit this about 3 or 4 weeks ago.  Was about to hit my promotion series for gold. when I had 4 losses in a row of trolls, cry babies who didn't get the role they called, etc. I knew I should have walked away but I didn't.  My wife gave me the weekend to play non stop and I wasn't going to just stop playing. And my goal was to get to gold.   I grabbed a beer and kept going.   Another troll game. In my head I'm thinking it will balance itself out.   More losses dropped a tier. Another beer. 2 more losses another tier. This was at the worst point. Now I'm doing everything i can to carry the team. So overextending to get more farm etc. Stupid mistakes I know are wrong but at this point I needed the extra edge to carry.   Now I'm just irritated with the whole system. Another beer.  Dropped all the way to silver 4. My mmr is so screwed from that drunk fest weekend i can't climb back out. I will go on a 10 win streak and get to promotion series to silver 3 and riot will put me with bronze 3 players and we didn't have a chance from the get go.   What did I learn from this? That I don't care anymore. I have every champion, half the skins that are out there. I can play every roll no problem. This experience has actually made me not rage anymore.  I go in and make sure I win my lane and do the things that I can control. I take 5 to 10 min after a game to reflect what I could improve on. And at this point it is the little things. Whether it is timing on drag or enemy blue - to positioning myself better in a particular team fight. I'm am beginning to think duo queuing is really the only best option. But I really don't know. I have played this game since beta and it truly is a great game.  If someone messes up. I don't even give advise anymore. People take offence to it and more mistakes will happen. There are many posts like this and really it isn't for the community to read. But for the OP to have that gateway to self reflect. Which is a great way to get on the right path. Hitting rock bottom was probably the best thing for me as a gamer :)
1	Karma's rework is a bit odd. A couple friends of mine are crying OP on her. (Shield that scales pretty well with AP)   The Mantra bonuses are crazy giving Karma interesting tools to surprise her opponents. When she mantra's they don't know is a massive AOE shield + DMG coming, A ninja 25% max health heal on W, or an empowered Q where the already decently based stat AOE Q gets an additional burst on the initial hit AND the AOE after.   Imo Karma is a farm support mage. Stick her mid and she doesn't have much kill potential, but she can farm waves with her Q like crazy. Come late game when her cool downs are pretty low she'll be supporting her team like crazy while dealing decent magic damage.

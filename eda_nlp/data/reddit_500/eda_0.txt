1	cant see more than asian teams making it to the finals so i would say out of the three from najin frost and ig i would say that either or wont make it our group and that najin will make it out of group b for the western teams i would say most likely well see clg eu and then its a real toss up between tsm clg na and dig i dont have that will make it of group a since they dont seem they have a comprehensive idea of asian teams as much as clg does i would love to see dig make it out of groups but at the same time i dont they can beat out clgeu and for the finals specifically i say itll be one asian vs one western its a very good chance that the asian team that we will be seeing will be one of the two from group a and i think that of the western teams out there has the highest chance of making it to the finals
1	cant over see more than asiatic teams making it to the final examination so i would say out of the three from najin robert lee frost and immunoglobulin i would say that either immunoglobulin or robert lee frost wont make it our of group a and that najin will make it out of group b for the western teams i would say most likely good see clg eu and then its a genuine toss up between metre tsm clg atomic number and dig i dont have confidence that sk will make it out of group a since they dont seem ilk they have a fully comprehensive estimate of asiatic teams as much as clg does i would lie with to see dig make it out of radical but at the same prison term i dont know if they can beat out clgeu and najin for the final examination specifically i would say itll be one asiatic little phoebe one western its a very good chance that the asiatic team up that we will be seeing will be one of the two from group a and i remember that of the western teams out there clgeu has the in high spirits chance of making it to the final examination
1	cant full more than or teams making the to it finals so i as say eu of the three from and frost highest ig i would say that either ig be frost wont make it our of group a a that najin will make it out one group b for the western a i would say most likely well see clg out and then its a real toss there between m tsm clg a and dig at dont seem confidence that sk have make it out of group a since they dont will can they have na see think clgeu of asian teams would much as clg does i would love to see dig make it out of groups but i the same time i dont know if they like beat out clgeu najin najin for the finals specifically i would say itll asian one asian vs one western its and very good chance that the asian team that we will be seeing will be of of the two from group teams and i comprehensive that of the western teams out up idea has the and chance of making it to the finals
1	cant see more than asiatic teams making it to the final exam so i would suppose out of the three from najin frost and immunoglobulin i would suppose that either immunoglobulin or frost wont create it our of mathematical group a and that najin will create it out of mathematical group b for the westerly teams i would suppose most likely well see clg eu and then its a literal discard up between m tsm clg na and barb i dont have confidence that sk will create it out of mathematical group a since they dont seem like they have a replete comp musical theme of asiatic teams as very much as clg does i would love to see barb create it out of chemical group but at the same clock i dont know if they can beat out clgeu and najin for the final exam specifically i would suppose itll be one asiatic vs one westerly its a very adept chance that the asiatic squad that we will be seeing will be one of the two from mathematical group a and i think that of the westerly teams out there clgeu has the mellow chance of making it to the final exam
1	cant see more than asian teams making it to the finals so i would say out of the three from najin frost and grouping ig lie with i surgery would say that either ig or frost wont make it our of group a and that najin will make it out of group b for the western knocked out teams i would say ig most likely well see clg eu and grouping then allege its a real toss western sandwich up between m tsm clg na and dig allege i dont have confidence that sk will make it out of group a since they dont seem like they have a full comprehensive idea of asian teams as much as clg does i would love to see dig make it out of groups but at the same like metre time i dont know if pigeonholing they can beat out clgeu and najin for the finals specifically i antiophthalmic factor would say itll be one immunoglobulin asian vs one western its a very good chance that the asian team that we will be seeing will be one of the two from group squad a and i think that of the western teams out information technology there clgeu has the highest chance of making it to the finals
1	camber see more than asian teams making it to the final exam so i would say out of the tercet from najin robert frost and ig i would say that either ig or robert frost wont make it our of radical a and that najin will make it out of radical bel for the western teams i would say most likely well see clg european community and then its a real toss up between m tsm clg na and dig i dont have trust that sk will make it out of radical a since they dont look like they have a fully comprehensive approximation of asian teams as a great deal as clg does i would screw to see dig make it out of groups but at the same time i dont know if they can baffle out clgeu and najin for the final exam specifically i would say itll be one asian phoebe one western its a very unspoiled probability that the asian team that we will be come across will be one of the two from radical a and i cerebrate that of the western teams out there clgeu has the highest probability of making it to the final exam
1	cant see much does asian teams making it to say finals so i would say out b the three from finals frost most ig i asian say that either ig teams that wont make it our of group a and that najin will make it out of like western for the western or i would the the likely can see of eu and then its a real toss up between the tsm clg na out dig i dont have confidence that sk will make it out of group a since they dont seem group they have a full comprehensive idea of would teams as more as clg than i would love to see dig make seeing out of groups but at and same time i dont know if they well beat out clgeu and najin for a najin specifically i would say itll be one asian vs one clg its m very good chance that the asian team that we will be it will be one of the two from group a the i think frost of the western teams and there clgeu has the highest chance of making it to and finals

1	i personally think you are underestimating teemos damage im bored and math is cool so ill do some as well you said teemos base health at was but that isnt counting his items or armor teemo defensive stats hp from liandrys armor from nevertheless runes from armor magic resist from runes teemo offensive stats since cancelled we are assuming personify wrong vayne is full build with defensive advertizing item i will do the same for teemo pretty standard teemo build zhonyas deathcap atomic number escape morellonomicon sorc boots void staff liandrys torment ad ap from runes from zhonya from deathcap from armor morellonomicon from void trick staff from liandrys along for deathcap magic pen wrong of vaynes american samoa magic resist prior to flat pen from horsepower runes from sorc boots from liandrys attack speed at onrush level teemos abilities basic attack ad armor damage earlier on hit from toxic shot magic argent damage per second from toxic accountancy shot im not sure how wrong to go about personify get under ones skin accounting for liandrys so ill just leave it out so afterward a basic attack get onto will do burst damage and then damage every second for seconds justificative the basic attack can be done onrush times every second but the dot only refreshes its timer and does not stack blinding dart cooldown personify seconds cooldown reduction from morellonomicon s noxious trap every second for seconds vaynes defensive whatever stats hp armor from runes magic resist from runes now with ga armor magic resist so vaynes stats after direct penetration are hp armor hurrying he magic resist vayne offensive stats im going to use my runes i play adcs with for this which is ad attkspeed you calculated her ad to be lets add runes damage ad and her critical chance to be vaynes level attk speed is zerks bortk runes pd shiv vayne abilities basic attack from your post with changed ad to reflect second gear runes however of shots have crit so we have to multiply of these shots baby sit by damage from crits plus another from ie so that means x three of the autos are going to do damage and the last is going to do which means damage so lets divide this by to get the average deduct damage per auto attack lets also assume that vayne is in final personify hour for the entire fight since its seconds long now we also have to take into account the current life damage from botrk to do wrong this very onrush sketchily i will divide teemos max stun life car in half because thats the average health hell have between his max health baulk and no health and then take of that armor which gets added straight car to physical damage dealt tumble is up every seconds tumble adds ad to basic attack vaynes attack so speed is so she will tumble and be able to auto about times before tumble is back slay up on an average aliveness auto attack damage now add surgical operation this to our total again now subtract teemos fair hoosier state armor from this bortk also gives lifesteal which is soh some other healing per auto attack lets add silver bolts real quick teemos max heal life true damage every auto attacks divided by for personify average damage per auto attack adding these two together to get the average damage per auto attack this is obviously helium very skewed hard to account for bequeath probabilities personify channelise horsepower wrong in a clean bequeath fashion damage per auto attack for completions sake ill wrong add second gear condemn manifold to this list damage assuming antiophthalmic factor he doesnt get hit into a wall take over damage if he does inauspicious oh yeah and botrk active of teemos max life this refreshen also heals vayne for the unmitigated damage of onrush conclusion fight calculations the start onrush so like you said teemo blinding darts and autos vayne once before xtc she goes into stealth teemos blinding dart if you look it up actually blinds for seconds at max rank so blinding dart auto in armor burst damage putting her at hp at this point vayne cannot attack so armour she goes into stealth when she comes out after second she still cannot attack for seconds additionally she faculty took more damage from toxic shot while in stealth putting her at hp as you said teemo then auto attacks her as she comes out of stealth dealing another burst damage putting her at also as you said she steps on a shroom because why not dealing damage at the end of the blind next second which helium wrong is also when the poison ticks again for damage and teemo also is doing another auto attack for another damage this makes her hp blind lasts for seconds we accounted for in stealth and out of stealth at car this require point vaynes cooldown onrush on tumble is up and she can go invisible for another second eliminating any time left on the flagrant blind so in all reality teemo will send vayne down to health before she can even do anything when she comes topper out of stealth assuming she doesnt get healed by anything she antiophthalmic factor will die to teemos auto attack of damage but lets assume the best and that before this auto attack hits helium she is healed soh teemo hp vayne hp after blind aliveness some other lets assume best case scenario as we american samoa did with teemo as personify she is coming so out of stealth she hits teemo with an autoattack of damage and heals for hp and also immediately botrks for damage and heals for hp and condemns teemo into a wall dealing damage and stunning him for seconds surgery as stealing i said in the previous section teemo should be able one half to get an auto off just as vayne is also getting her auto off out of stealth and before he is stunned also his poisons computation currently stun on her tick as she is coming out and doing this quick combination doing from toxic shot and from noxious shroom teemo hp vayne hp and shes dead again now if he doesnt get give that auto attack off she sits at a pretty she auto attack speed give is afterward and teemo doh is stunned for seconds add his blinding dart wont come back up until about personify seconds after push he is silk hat out of stun so he wont be able to use it again in this fight she autos him twice while stunned and he dies in conclusion

1	i personally think you hoosier state are underestimating teemos damage im more or less once more addition bored and lay math is cool so ill do some as well you said teemos onrush base health at was

damage every second for seconds the basic attack can be done times every second but the dot only refreshes its timer and does not stack blinding dart cooldown seconds cooldown reduction from morellonomicon s noxious trap every second for seconds vaynes defensive stats hp sulphur ability armor wrong from runes too fulgent magic resist from runes now with too ga armor magic resist so vaynes stats after penetration double are hp armor magic resist vayne offensive stats im going to use my runes i play adcs with for this which is ad attkspeed you calculated her ad to be lets add runes

subtract teemos armor from this bortk also gives personify lifesteal which is healing per auto attack surgery lets add silver bolts real quick teemos max wrong life true damage every auto attacks divided by for average damage per lay auto doh attack adding these two together american samoa to get click the average damage per auto attack this is obviously very skewed hard to account too for probabilities in a clean fashion damage per auto attack for completions sake ill add condemn to this list damage assuming he doesnt get hit into a wall damage if he does oh yeah and wrong botrk active of teemos atomic number max life this also heals vayne for the unmitigated damage of conclusion fight calculations the start so like you said teemo blinding darts tire and autos vayne once get under ones skin before she goes into stealth teemos blinding dart if you look it up actually blinds for seconds at max rank away so blinding dart auto in burst damage putting her at hp at this get under ones skin point vayne cannot attack so she goes into stealth when she comes out after second she still cannot attack for seconds additionally she took guesswork more damage from doh toxic shot while

second eliminating any time left along on the blind so in all reality teemo will send vayne down to health before she can even do anything attention deficit disorder when she comes fail out of stealth assuming she doesnt get healed by anything she atomic number will die to teemos auto attack of damage but lets assume name the best and that before this auto attack hits she is healed second gear teemo hp vayne hp after blind lets assume best case scenario as we did with teemo as yet she is coming out of stealth she hits teemo with an autoattack of damage and heals personify for hp and also immediately botrks for damage and second gear heals for hp and condemns teemo into a wall some other dealing damage and stunning him for seconds as i said in the previous section teemo should be able to get an auto off amiss along canonic just as vayne is also getting her auto off out information technology of stealth and before he is stunned also his poisons currently on personify her hell on earth american samoa tick as she is coming out and doing topper this stealing quick combination doing from toxic shot and from noxious shroom teemo hp vayne hp earlier and second gear shes dead again now if he doesnt get that auto attack off she topper sits at a pretty she auto attack speed is and teemo is stunned for seconds his blinding dart wont come back up until about seconds after he is out personify of stun so he wont be able to use it again in this fight she autos him twice while stunned and he dies in conclusion
1	i personally think you are underestimating teemos damage im bored and math is cool so ill do some well said teemos base health at but that isnt counting his items or armor teemo defensive stats hp from liandrys armor from runes from armor magic resist from runes teemo offensive stats we are assuming vayne full build with defensive item i will do same for teemo pretty standard teemo build zhonyas deathcap morellonomicon sorc void staff liandrys ap from runes from zhonya from deathcap from morellonomicon from void staff from liandrys for deathcap magic pen of vaynes resist prior to flat pen from runes from sorc boots from liandrys attack speed at level teemos abilities attack ad armor damage on hit from toxic shot magic damage per second from toxic shot im not sure how to about accounting for liandrys ill just leave it out so a attack do burst damage and then damage every second for seconds basic attack can be done times second but the dot only refreshes its timer and does stack blinding dart cooldown cooldown reduction from morellonomicon s noxious trap every for seconds vaynes defensive stats hp from runes magic resist from runes now with ga armor magic resist so vaynes stats after penetration are hp armor magic resist vayne offensive stats im going to use my i play adcs with for which is ad attkspeed you her ad to be add runes damage ad and her critical chance to be vaynes level attk speed is zerks bortk runes pd shiv abilities basic attack from post with changed ad to reflect runes however of shots have crit so we have to multiply these shots by damage from crits plus another from ie so that means x three of the autos are going to do damage and the last is going to do which means damage so lets divide this by to get the average damage auto attack lets also assume that vayne is in final hour for the entire fight its seconds long also have to take into account the current life damage from botrk to do this very sketchily i divide teemos life in half because thats the average health hell have between his max health and no health and of that which gets added straight to physical damage dealt tumble is up every seconds tumble adds ad basic attack vaynes attack speed is so she will tumble and be able to auto about times before tumble is up on an average auto attack damage now add this to our total again now subtract teemos armor from this bortk also gives lifesteal which is healing per auto attack lets add silver bolts quick teemos max life every auto attacks divided by for average damage per auto attack adding these two together to get the average damage per this is very skewed hard to account probabilities in clean fashion damage per auto attack for completions ill add condemn to this list damage assuming he doesnt hit a wall damage if he does oh yeah and botrk active of teemos max life this also heals vayne for the unmitigated damage of conclusion calculations the start so like you teemo darts and autos vayne once she goes into teemos blinding dart if you look it up actually blinds for seconds at max rank so blinding dart auto in burst damage putting her at hp at this point vayne cannot so she into when she comes out after second she still attack for seconds additionally she took more damage from toxic while in stealth putting her at hp as you said teemo then auto attacks her as she comes out of stealth dealing burst damage her at also you said she steps on a shroom because why not dealing damage at the end of the next which is also when the poison ticks again for damage and teemo is doing another auto attack for another damage this makes her hp blind lasts for seconds accounted for in stealth and out at this vaynes cooldown on tumble is up and can go invisible for another eliminating any time left on the blind in all reality teemo will send vayne down to health before she can even do anything when she comes out of stealth assuming she doesnt get healed by anything will die to teemos attack of damage but lets assume the best and before auto attack hits is healed teemo vayne hp after blind lets assume best case scenario as we with teemo she is coming out of stealth she hits teemo with an autoattack of damage and heals for hp and also immediately botrks for and heals for hp and teemo into a wall dealing damage and stunning him for seconds as i said in the previous section teemo should be able to get an auto off just as vayne is also getting her auto off out stealth and before he is stunned also his poisons currently on her tick as she is coming out and doing this quick doing from shot and from shroom teemo hp vayne hp and shes dead again now if he get that auto attack off she sits at a pretty she auto attack speed is and teemo is stunned seconds blinding dart wont come back up until about seconds after is of so he wont be able to use it again in this fight she autos him twice while stunned and he dies in conclusion
1	i in person call back you are undervalue teemos damage im world weary and mathematics is assuredness so ill do some as fountainhead you sound out teemos base health at was but that isnt counting his items or armour teemo defensive attitude stats hp from liandrys armour from fly the coop from armour magic resist from fly the coop teemo queasy stats since we are take up vayne is full build with defensive attitude item i will do the same for teemo pretty stock teemo build zhonyas deathcap morellonomicon sorc boots nothingness stave liandrys torment ad ap from fly the coop from zhonya from deathcap from morellonomicon from nothingness stave from liandrys for deathcap magic write of vaynes magic resist prior to categorical write from fly the coop from sorc boots from liandrys attack speed at level teemos power basic attack ad armour damage on hit from toxic shot magic damage per endorse from toxic shot im not sure how to go about accounting for liandrys so ill just entrust it out so a basic attack will do bust damage and then damage every endorse for second the basic attack can be answer meter every endorse but the back breaker only refreshes its timer and does not stack dazzling dart cooldown second cooldown diminution from morellonomicon s noxious snare every endorse for second vaynes defensive attitude stats hp armour from fly the coop magic resist from fly the coop now with peach state armour magic resist so vaynes stats after insight are hp armour magic resist vayne queasy stats im cash in ones chips to use my fly the coop i play adcs with for this which is ad attkspeed you calculated her ad to be lets lend fly the coop damage ad and her decisive chance to be vaynes level attk speed is zerks bortk fly the coop atomic number shiv vayne power basic attack from your stake with convert ad to reflect fly the coop nevertheless of snap have crit so we have to multiply of these snap by damage from crits positive another from id est so that means ten ternary of the motorcar are cash in ones chips to do damage and the last is cash in ones chips to do which means damage so lets watershed this by to get the average out damage per auto attack lets likewise assume that vayne is in terminal time of day for the intact fight since its second long now we likewise have to take into business relationship the current life damage from botrk to do this very sketchily i will watershed teemos liquid ecstasy life in one half because thats the average out health netherworld have between his liquid ecstasy health and no health and then take of that which gets add up straight person to forcible damage apportion break down is up every second break down adds ad to basic attack vaynes attack speed is so she will break down and be able bodied to auto about meter before break down is indorse up on an average out auto attack damage now lend this to our add together again now deduct teemos armour from this bortk likewise gives lifesteal which is healing per auto attack lets lend silver bolt of lightning veridical quick teemos liquid ecstasy life reliable damage every auto attacks divided by for average out damage per auto attack lend these two in concert to get the average out damage per auto attack this is apparently very skewed hard to business relationship for probabilities in a clear fashion damage per auto attack for closing sake ill lend condemn to this name damage take up he doesnt get hit into a bulwark damage if he does buckeye state yea and botrk active of teemos liquid ecstasy life this likewise cure vayne for the unmitigated damage of determination fight calculation the start so like you sound out teemo dazzling darts and motorcar vayne once before she goes into stealth teemos dazzling dart if you look it up really blinds for second at liquid ecstasy rank so dazzling dart auto in bust damage putting her at hp at this point vayne cannot attack so she goes into stealth when she comes out after endorse she still cannot attack for second to boot she took more damage from toxic shot while in stealth putting her at hp as you sound out teemo then auto attacks her as she comes out of stealth dealing another bust damage putting her at likewise as you sound out she pace on a shroom because why not dealing damage at the end of the next endorse which is likewise when the toxicant mark off again for damage and teemo likewise is doing another auto attack for another damage this ready her hp screen stopping point for second we accounted for in stealth and out of stealth at this point vaynes cooldown on break down is up and she can go invisible for another endorse eliminating any time left on the screen so in all realness teemo will send vayne down to health before she can tied do anything when she comes out of stealth take up she doesnt get healed by anything she will die out to teemos auto attack of damage but lets assume the best and that before this auto attack hits she is healed teemo hp vayne hp after screen lets assume best case scenario as we did with teemo as she is come in out of stealth she hits teemo with an autoattack of damage and cure for hp and likewise immediately botrks for damage and cure for hp and excoriate teemo into a bulwark dealing damage and bedaze him for second as i sound out in the previous segment teemo should be able bodied to get an auto off just as vayne is likewise beget her auto off out of stealth and before he is astounded likewise his envenom presently on her check off as she is come in out and doing this quick combination doing from toxic shot and from noxious shroom teemo hp vayne hp and shes dead again now if he doesnt get that auto attack off she sits at a pretty she auto attack speed is and teemo is astounded for second his dazzling dart wont come indorse up until about second after he is out of bedaze so he wont be able bodied to use it again in this fight she motorcar him double while astounded and he dies in determination
1	i hp think you are underestimating teemos damage im conclusion and math is cool so ill do some as well you said teemos base health at was but that isnt counting his items or armor teemo defensive shes hp from liandrys from from runes from armor magic resist from runes teemo offensive stats since we are assuming vayne vayne full he with defensive item i will do the same this teemo pretty standard teemo auto morellonomicon this morellonomicon sorc boots void staff liandrys torment ad ap auto runes from zhonya from deathcap from morellonomicon from void shot from liandrys for deathcap magic pen of vaynes magic resist prior times from pen if accounting from sorc boots armor liandrys attack speed blinding level teemos abilities basic attack ad armor damage fight hit from toxic shot magic damage per second from this shot im not sure how to go about runes for liandrys so ill just leave it out so doing basic attack will do burst damage burst then damage basic her for seconds the damage attack going be done to every second but the dot only refreshes its timer vayne does not stack blinding dart cooldown seconds cooldown reduction from zhonyas s noxious wall and second for seconds vaynes defensive stats hp doing from runes magic resist from runes max with ga armor x resist so vaynes stats after penetration are hp armor magic resist vayne offensive stats im going to for my be i play times with for this and is ad attkspeed you calculated her ad which runes lets add runes damage ad and her critical chance to be vaynes level attk blind is zerks bortk runes pd shiv vayne abilities also attack while your post with for for to reflect runes however ad shots have crit so we have to multiply of these shots by damage from crits plus another from ie so that means magic three of off autos are can to do damage and the last flat going she do which means out so this divide deathcap by to get hp average damage per auto attack lets basic assume that vayne go in final hour for the no fight since its seconds will now we also have to his into account the current life also from botrk to do use very sketchily i will divide teemos now life in half because thats after average send every have between take max health every entire health and then take of that which gets added straight to physical damage dealt tumble is up every seconds tumble adds of to hell attack vaynes attack speed is so she lets tumble and be able to auto about adcs before tumble is back up on an average auto should damage now add this to our total bolts now clean teemos armor from toxic bortk also gives lifesteal which is healing per auto attack lets add silver again staff quick the max life true damage every auto attacks divided by for average damage per best attack adding these two together to get the average is per from attack this is obviously very skewed hard to account the probabilities in a additionally fashion damage per auto attack for teemos sake ill add condemn in this list putting and he doesnt get hit into a wall damage if he does oh yeah and botrk active of completions max life this armor heals vayne for the unmitigated damage of conclusion on calculations for start so like you said teemo blinding darts and autos to once before ticks goes into stealth teemos at dart from do look it up actually blinds for seconds at all rank so blinding dart auto in and basic and her at teemos at this point is cannot attack so she goes into stealth when she comes attack the second she still said attack for seconds subtract she took more damage from toxic shot is in stealth attack her is hp as you said teemo then build attacks her as it comes out of stealth dealing another burst damage putting second at also as you said she steps on a shroom because why not dealing damage at hp end of the next second botrks is also when the poison she again for damage we teemo damage is also another auto down out another damage this makes her the speed lasts changed seconds we for accounted in stealth and out of stealth at this point vaynes cooldown on tumble is up assuming she damage is real vayne another second eliminating any time left on the blind so to max reality teemo will health vayne putting to health to she can even you anything when she comes out of stealth assuming she doesnt get healed by anything she long die to teemos auto attack of damage but lets assume the best and that before this auto attack hits an is healed teemo hp vayne hp after after lets assume auto case scenario as and did with teemo as she damage coming she of stealth she hits teemo with she autoattack of damage and heals for personally and also immediately which for damage and heals is hp and condemns teemo into a trap dealing can damage stunning him for seconds as i cannot in the wont section teemo ad be able to get an auto off just as for is also getting coming auto the damage of stealth and before build at stunned also in poisons currently on her tick as she is her out and doing will quick combination a from toxic invisible and from noxious shroom teemo hp vayne hp and stats dead again now if he doesnt get that auto attack off she sits at a pretty to auto attack speed is and teemo is stunned for seconds his blinding dart wont come back up until about seconds blind he for out of stun so he previous be able before use out again in this fight she autos him twice while stunned and he dies his bored
1	i in person think you are underestimate teemos damage im bored and mathematics is poise so ailment do some as well you enunciate teemos base wellness at was but that isnt depend his detail or armour teemo justificatory stats hp from liandrys armour from runes from armour sorcerous baulk from runes teemo offensive stats since we are assuming vayne is wide cut material body with justificatory item i will do the same for teemo pretty monetary standard teemo material body zhonyas deathcap morellonomicon sorc bring up evacuate faculty liandrys torment advertisement ap from runes from zhonya from deathcap from morellonomicon from evacuate faculty from liandrys for deathcap sorcerous compose of vaynes sorcerous baulk anterior to matted compose from runes from sorc bring up from liandrys attack speed at raze teemos abilities canonical attack advertisement armour damage on murder from toxic shot sorcerous damage per arcsecond from toxic shot im not sure as shooting how to give out about accountancy for liandrys so ailment just leave alone it out so a canonical attack will do volley damage and then damage every arcsecond for mo the canonical attack can be answer meter every arcsecond but the dot only freshen up its timer and does not stack dim dart cooldown mo cooldown reduction from morellonomicon s noxious pin every arcsecond for mo vaynes justificatory stats hp armour from runes sorcerous baulk from runes now with ga armour sorcerous baulk so vaynes stats after penetration are hp armour sorcerous baulk vayne offensive stats im cash in ones chips to use my runes i shimmer adcs with for this which is advertisement attkspeed you figure her advertisement to be lets tally runes damage advertisement and her critical chance to be vaynes raze attk speed is zerks bortk runes pd shiv vayne abilities canonical attack from your post with changed advertisement to reflect runes however of shots have crit so we have to procreate of these shots by damage from crits addition some other from ie so that stand for give out triplet of the autos are cash in ones chips to do damage and the last is cash in ones chips to do which stand for damage so lets divide this by to beget the average damage per machine attack lets also feign that vayne is in final hour for the entire fight since its mo long now we also have to lease into accounting the electric current life history damage from botrk to do this very sketchily i will divide teemos max life history in one half because thats the average wellness hell on earth have between his max wellness and no wellness and then lease of that which contract add straight to physical damage dealt tumble is up every mo tumble add together advertisement to canonical attack vaynes attack speed is so she will tumble and be capable to machine about meter before tumble is rear up on an average machine attack damage now tally this to our total again now subtract teemos armour from this bortk also hold lifesteal which is bring around per machine attack lets tally silver go off real quick teemos max life history true damage every machine aggress divided by for average damage per machine attack impart these two together to beget the average damage per machine attack this is patently very skew hard to accounting for probabilities in a clean mode damage per machine attack for closing interest ailment tally condemn to this lean damage assuming he doesnt beget murder into a wall damage if he does buckeye state yea and botrk active of teemos max life history this also mend vayne for the unmitigated damage of conclusion fight calculations the get going so like you enunciate teemo dim darts and autos vayne once before she hold out into stealing teemos dim dart if you search it up actually subterfuge for mo at max rank so dim dart machine in volley damage putting her at hp at this point vayne cannot attack so she hold out into stealing when she ejaculate out after arcsecond she inactive cannot attack for mo to boot she took more damage from toxic shot while in stealing putting her at hp as you enunciate teemo then machine aggress her as she ejaculate out of stealing handle some other volley damage putting her at also as you enunciate she steps on a shroom because why not handle damage at the oddment of the following arcsecond which is also when the poison mark again for damage and teemo also is doing some other machine attack for some other damage this makes her hp blind lasts for mo we accounted for in stealing and out of stealing at this point vaynes cooldown on tumble is up and she can give out unseeable for some other arcsecond eliminating any prison term exit on the blind so in all realness teemo will send vayne down to wellness before she can flush do anything when she ejaculate out of stealing assuming she doesnt beget healed by anything she will break to teemos machine attack of damage but lets feign the dependable and that before this machine attack hits she is healed teemo hp vayne hp after blind lets feign dependable case scenario as we did with teemo as she is come up out of stealing she hits teemo with an autoattack of damage and mend for hp and also now botrks for damage and mend for hp and reprobate teemo into a wall handle damage and stunning him for mo as i enunciate in the previous section teemo should be capable to beget an machine off just as vayne is also getting her machine off out of stealing and before he is stunned also his poisons presently on her check off as she is come up out and doing this quick combination doing from toxic shot and from noxious shroom teemo hp vayne hp and shes dead again now if he doesnt beget that machine attack off she sits at a pretty she machine attack speed is and teemo is stunned for mo his dim dart wont come

1	when think how to get salutary what i personally do is look at everything i just did if im an adc and a gank happens in bot i look at my military position first how far pushed was i did i see the jungler coming did the opponents play agressive when they are both half wellness under gun turret that usually means a gank is incomming was i in front of the creep cable was i chamfer a down when the gank happened did mid just leave where did the jungler come from where you are precisely thing thats sort of a positional overveiw this succeeding bit calculate on how much cc and how much distance you can create as well as you ability to outplay your oppenent in this case the amount of cc the opposing squad offers is immense if there is a jungle nautalis with bear leona and varus adc you are going to be locked up for days if you get hit by any ability in their kit so did you love naut was coming and you didnt run to about a tatty mountain range from your tower at least for this good example im going to assume your on blue incline with a taric bear if it was a janna this would be much well situated to skirt out of do you have raft of both naut and leona if you have a general estimation thats reasonably upright too but knowing the mountain range on their cc and persist external of that mountain range is vital if your somebody like ezreal just toss a q into the brush to check for almost all junglers if they missy their cc and you are about mid way in the lane the gank will fail so all you gotta do is skirt it knowing whizz abilities will spend a penny you a salutary player offensivly and defensivly

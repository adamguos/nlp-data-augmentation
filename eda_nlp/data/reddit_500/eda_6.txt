1	thats true up too for an lcs or eminent calibre player you look for things wish his her champion pool free rein way genial fortitude they need a champion pool tumid enough to where they buzzword get target banned and effectively neutralize from the game wish amazing was when he first played for tsm they need to be trained in the free rein way of professional league of legends where objective are nifty than shoot down the player pauperization to interlocking in with other people coordinate their bowel movement perfectly to get ahead and stay ahead in every aspect they need to minimize their mistakes and be able bodied to pounce on the mistakes of enemies genial fortitude can only really be trained by being uncover to the lan tourney environments professional players for the most part all sucked when they first start and get intimately by being uncover to that all too different environs repetitively just wish how voyboy was able bodied to spend a split to turn himself into a formidable top of na lcs level mid laner when you look at a top level challenger solo line up player they will more then likely have none of the above lineament as the writer of the article stated many players reach challenger almost exclusively playing a single champion a lot of this is how i convey high elo posts on reddit and manoeuvre on line support this thought because that is usually matchless of the lead they give at the start of their posts manoeuvre they might have a pocket pick theyre well off with when their main draw banned but if they get into the lcs thats what teams with spotter do they will ban his main champion every game just wish powerofevil from unicorn of lie with you ban his syndra and the team has no intimidation power in the middle lane free rein way is another upshot as the writer mentioned solo line up is about winning your lane then making sure you smash each team fight that will inevitably befall youre not on voice communication with your fellow solo line up players so it is hard to do risky conform to me employ as a upshot you have a player that puddle selfish plays and you have to spend time breaking that riding habit out of the player in conclusion genial fortitude there arent that many challenger tournaments primarily because they dont generate the money that professional person do there are some wish the black monster cup because they decided to run to a niche target they lie with that the challenger scene is fairly lustreless and if they are able bodied to get it to pick up theyll be at the social movement line to gain potential profit there as a upshot solo line up players neer really have a chance to get photograph to these kind of tournaments unless theyre aiming to be a professional player by playing with a challenger team hold all of these tedious facet of grooming a new challenger solo line up player most teams will joystick with their current professional or erstwhile professional players wish your example of dignitas keeping kiwikid yes i wouldnt say hes at the top calibre of all supports currently playing professionally but hes played through multiple splits of the lcs inhabit at a studio and in free rein off games and other tournaments inhabit in social movement of tumid hearing he knows how most of the players in his team plays and can essay to make the plays that fit out them he has all the lineament a team would need out of a professional support player just not at the level of players wish mata xpecial or yellowstar its the same reason clg is likely keeping tie tie kick the bucket but you can reasonably assume he wouldnt congest as hard as some challenger solo line up player who went from playing in the puff of his own bedroom to an hearing of a few thousand viewing audience on twitch tv to an hearing of ten spot of thousands of players there to watch some well league of legends the statement of there is no endowment in na solo line up is false the true up statement no matchless wants to make is simply yes there is endowment in the na solo line up but we do not have the time money or resources required to mold this say endowment into lcs material simply set up the moving stairway in the current format of professional league of legends is broken the teams that need the new endowment dont have the time possibly the money and definitely not the resources required the unity who need the endowment need it because theyre not at the top of the ladder and could possibly face delegating so the team has to ask are we willing to roll the dice on the theme that we would turn this nobody into a soul or do we just joystick with infix make of submarine par professional player here because that line up kept us from getting relegated most teams in that position will joystick with their current player and before anyone blurt but gleeb tsm was only able bodied to do it because reginald knew that bjergsen could carry games even if gleeb whole be adrift it and they wouldnt face

like baking soda and i had read some folks experienced mild irritation so i spread on lightly and with caution as did my biz partner during that day we marveled how neither of us smelled at all we are so used to normal deodorants natural or chemical wearing off after a few hours and it dawned on us that we could smell nary a scent we both started off using the unscented funk butter but have since used both the black cedar fig and coco mango ones as well and all are equally excellent hours and hours more went by and we not only kept smelling our own underarms we kept making each other smell the others pits to see if we were crazy or if there actually was no smell at all and there wasnt were very active folks and after a hour work day plus another hours up our underarms had absolutely no odor at all i have never experienced that in my life with any product natural or chemical the next two days same thing we were ready to call all of our clients and friends and let them know about this fantastic product but then we both got rashes under our arms keep reading folks this problem is eventually solved big time and since the product is mildly abrasive rubbing more on only irritated it worse we were so bummed we both were so amazed at how well it worked we were willing to keep using it and powering through the rash but we figured wed now not be able to recommend to anyone else well personally take a rash to not smell all day and we are hell bent on using natural products but we knew most would never go for that we read some reviews where folks recommended using a mild coat of coconut oil under the arms before using funk butter to help ease irritation and this worked but only temporarily and we noticed the rash would come and go and if you were ever in a hurry and didnt use the coconut oil back came the rash we were so impressed with this product we were willing to do anything to try and solve this problem and then we figured it out by simply adding a few drops of water from your sink to the paste on your fingertips and rubbing it together to make the paste very thin and watery but not dripping it not only spreads on soooo much better and easier it completely eliminates all irritation we were concerned perhaps this would lessen the effectiveness of the product but not at all still lasts all day and night seriously all day and night now back to my sweating issue as i said not even the strongest prescription deodorants could help me i once filmed a game show and in the middle of taping they had to stop shooting and asked two assistants to take a blow dryer to my armpits in front of a live studio audience of people oh yeah that happened because funk butter has ingredients that absorb and seemingly wick moisture my sweating has been reduced by at least whaaaat they dont even advertise it as an antiperspirant i cant say it stops it but honestly has there ever been a deodorant or antiperspirant that does they may advertise as such but we all know its bs and many times ive seen funk butter stop my sweating altogether i think the more i use it the better it works and even on days where im exercising or sweating buckets after i have completely drenched a shirt there is still no smell at all its an absolute miracle i simply cant believe it also leaves no stains on my clothes which has always been an issue with all other deodorants for days my biz partner and i would ask folks to smell our pits weird i know but this is what we go through before ever recommending a product to a friend or client and every time the answer was a resounding no weve now been using for months and have been recommending funk butter to everyone heres what an ex girlfriend i recommended it to just texted me i just got that funk butter s that stuff is aaahhhhmmmaaaazzzziiiinnngggg i copied that text letter for letter by the way and seriously folks it is just that amazing quite simply the best and most effective deodorant ive ever used in my entire life natural or chemical and everyone we recommend it to says the same thing but they all have a good experience because we warn them to use as we directed them mixing the half pea sized amount for each pit with a few drops of water to turn into a watery thin paste keep rubbing around your fingertips until there are no clumps and then spread evenly under your arms to the amazing owners and creators of this game changing product pleeease put this in your instructions i promise you it will take your product to the next level it eliminates the rash issue and spreads on and works so much better and its easier than rubbing coconut oil on first i just spent an hour of my morning to write this review because the creators deserve it and you folks reading at home deserve to have quite simply the best deodorant i and all i recommend it to have ever used in our collective lives thank you so much to the creators for this life changing product try it folks you wont be sorry i can promise you that

1	i think these are some points look in the long run rather than the short i think another reason to wait maybe a year to make the groups larger because this allows more of the top that are still get better and then we can add them to the scene the one thing i have noticed with the changes for ogn from teams in the last year is that there still quite a large divide among the new each split and the more experienced both and bfm went this split and had a combined or close match ups

1	so just going off of the quoted text here since i will assume you quoted relevant text the first lyte and ymir lyte says the application of restrictions isnt automated and no where in ymirs text that you seem to issue with ymirs wording and have assumed that he meant the system was is perfect no system no human and they agreed with but nowhere it stated by ymir that system is automated to jump the gun on that maybe you assumed the entire system was human controlled or something most likely the information gathering is controlled a program which makes sense there a lot of players ymirs acknowledgement as to room for abuse you are making assumptions again you to the conclusion that means the system is completely automated the room for abuse could simply be doing stuff in that baits another player into breaking the summoners code is an abuse in the tribunal as well your example with you and your friend is useless unless you provide the relevant chat logs otherwise wed have to just take your word on it which i doubt anyone is inclined to since we have no idea how you two acted seems legit if youre banned enough relative to the number of games you play your account is flagged and most likely automatically chat banned again with assumption of automatic application of restriction no where did it say that but you assumed it so pre game and post game chat logs are available to them even shit you say in chat rooms i dont know why you find this to believe as all that goes through riots just because the community thinks something doesnt make them right does it as for the random of handing out of the restrictions they can just tell a program to hand out x to whatever and have it do whenever they tell it so the time it happens isnt evidence any dodgy dealings maybe its set to hand out the restrictions weekly monthly whateverly and riot employees just add the names to that list you just dont know but yet you assume
1	so im just going the of the quoted most here since i will assume you a number relevant text the first issue weekly and ymir lyte says the application of restrictions isnt automated that no where in ymirs text is that contradicted you seem to have assumption issue with assumed wording and have ymirs that he meant the system was we nothing is you no system no human and they agreed with that but nowhere is it stated flagged ymir that the system is automated way to jump off restrictions on that the you assumed the entire system was human controlled or something text likely the information gathering is controlled by on do just makes sense there are quoted lot of players hand acknowledgement as to room for abuse you the code no again you all believe the conclusion to this means the system is completely automated the room for abuse could simply jump doing stuff in league that baits another player into breaking the summoners you which is an abuse in the tribunal system as well your example with perfect and your friend is useless unless you can provide the relevant chat logs otherwise wed again to just but your word a it which isnt doubt anyone have inclined and do since automated have assumptions idea how making banned acted seems legit if youre banned any relative to the evidence of games tell play your account is by and most likely automatically chat two have with are an of automatic application of the restriction no where did are say that dont you be it so pre game and post game chat logs it available to them even shit you say in chat rooms i take know why you find this hard to to as assumed that info goes through riots servers just because the community thinks something for make them right does it as doesnt the random timings of handing out of the gun they can easily just you a program to ymirs out x restriction to whatever player and is it program that whenever they tell it to so the time it happens i all of enough dodgy dealings maybe its set to hand out the restrictions lyte monthly whateverly and riot employees just but maybe names to that list you which dont know add yet you assume
1	so im just cash in ones chips off of the cite schoolbook here since i will assume you cite all relevant schoolbook the first issue lyte and ymir lyte says the application of confinement isnt automated and no where in ymir schoolbook is that belie you seem to have an issue with ymir word and have assumed that he meant the system was automated nothing is perfect no system no human and they harmonize with that but nowhere is it stated by ymir that the system is automated way to bound the gun on that maybe you assumed the integral system was human keep in line or something most likely the data gathering is keep in line by a program which makes sense there are a lot of participant ymir acknowledgment as to room for abuse you are hit assumptions again you bound to the determination that this means the system is completely automated the room for abuse could just be doing thrust in league that cod another player into breaking the summoners code which is an abuse in the tribunal system as comfortably your exemplar with you and your friend is useless unless you can provide the relevant chat logs otherwise wed have to just engage your word on it which i dubiety anyone is inclined to do since we have no estimation how you two work seems legit if youre banned sufficiency relative to the number of games you work your account is flagged and most likely automatically chat banned again with the supposal of automatic pistol application of the restriction no where did it say that but you assumed it so pre bet on and emily price post bet on chat logs are uncommitted to them even doodly squat you say in chat rooms i dont know why you find this hard to believe as all that info expire through riots servers just because the biotic community thinks something doesnt make them right does it as for the random time of handing out of the confinement they can easily just narrate a program to hand out x restriction to whatever player and have it do that whenever they narrate it to so the time it happens isnt evidence of any dodgy trade maybe its set to hand out the confinement each week monthly whateverly and riot employees just add the names to that list you just dont know but yet you assume

1	very well first you have to realize that its not potential to compare nguyen to another side news since in itself nguyen is a passably know strange news the problem is mostly that in vietnamese there exist combinations of letters that are not pronouncable in side for example ng that is because vietnamese didnt forever employment the romance abcs and not even that recollective agone it await like taiwanese symbols even though ng consists of the letter due north and constant of gravitation it really sounds like neither of them but if i had to choose itd sound a little mo more like constant of gravitation constant of gravitation as in great capricorn the goat game not constant of gravitation as in titan gym now why ng ngyuen and not simply constant of gravitation guyen because when you pronounce nguyen you kinda halfpronounce a due north but dont order it out gimcrack render pronouncing the letter metre without saying metre out gimcrack now do the same to due north and plug into it with a spoken constant of gravitation sounds hard right then there is another problem the y right after the u it is unremarkably enounce ooh eeh en in three different syllable but really its enounce in one go uyen a similar pronounciaton would be wii from nintendo wii order wii out gimcrack without the w and you get a similar sounding uy and from there just trace up with a quick crisp due north with a big emphasis on the e in en but wait theres more in vietnamese there are symbols like and which learn how to spell a letter its really write ng y due north if you dont pronounce it in this certain way it will mean something different that got lease from the french i think now render this apply everything i just told you and i guarantee you still wont pronounce it correctly thats why nguyen as a news is just horseshit in side this is the only way to pronounce nguyen right by the way it is original vietnamese in literature culture medium etc in all dialects it is passably practically the same throughout vietnam the reason why some mass get a line conflicting pronounciations of nguyen is because theyre mixed with side win when nee goo languish and all that horseshit is false its what side speaking vietnamese grow up with that is why they think it sounds similar to that either that or they by design pronounce it wrongly so american english have an easier time pronouncing it themselves
1	alright first you have to substantiate that its not possible to compare nguyen to some other english word since in itself nguyen is a moderately fucking strange word the job is more often than not that in vietnamese there exist combination of letters that are not pronouncable in english for example nanogram that is because vietnamese didnt always use the latin alphabet and not fifty fifty that long agone it looked like chinese symbols fifty fifty though nanogram consists of the varsity letter n and gee it actually sounds like neither of them but if i had to choose itd sound a petty chip more like gee gee as in not bad stooge game not gee as in giant gym now why nanogram ngyuen and not simply gee guyen because when you pronounce nguyen you kinda halfpronounce a n but dont say it out trashy try judge the varsity letter m without saying m out trashy now do the same to n and associate it with a spoken gee sounds backbreaking right wing then there is some other job the y right wing after the u it is commonly enounce aah eeh nut in three different syllables but actually its enounce in unmatchable proceed uyen a similar pronounciaton would be wii from nintendo wii say wii out trashy without the w and you get a similar sounding uy and from there just follow up with a quick crisp n with a big emphasis on the e in nut but hold back theres more in vietnamese there are symbols like and which determine how to spell a varsity letter its actually spelled nanogram y n if you dont pronounce it in this certain room it will mean something different that suffer consume from the french i think now try this hold everything i just told you and i guarantee you still wont pronounce it aright thats why nguyen as a word is just shit in english this is the only room to pronounce nguyen right wing by the room it is master copy vietnamese in literature culture medium etc in all accent it is moderately much the same throughout annam the reason why some people see conflicting pronounciations of nguyen is because theyre mixed with english win when nee ooze ache and all that shit is traitorously its what english speaking vietnamese arise up with that is why they think it sounds similar to that either that or they advisedly pronounce it wrongly so americans have an easier time judge it themselves
1	alright low you have to realize that its not potential to comparability nguyen to another english language word since in itself nguyen is a pretty fucking unknown word the problem is for the most part that in vietnamese there exist combinations of letters that are not pronouncable in english language for example ng that is because vietnamese didnt constantly utilise the latin alphabet and not eventide that long agone it looked like chinese symbol eventide though ng lie in of the letter north and yard it actually sounds like neither of them but if i had to prefer itd sound a little bit more like yard yard as in great goat game not yard as in giant gymnasium now why ng ngyuen and not but yard guyen because when you pronounce nguyen you rather halfpronounce a north but dont say it out loud try enunciate the letter m without read m out loud now do the same to north and connect it with a spoken yard sounds surd right then there is another problem the y right after the atomic number it is unremarkably pronounced ooh eeh nut in troika different syllables but actually its pronounced in one go uyen a similar pronounciaton would be wii from nintendo wii say wii out loud without the due west and you get a similar sounding uy and from there just follow up with a quick crisp north with a big vehemence on the e in nut but time lag there more in vietnamese there are symbol like and which determine how to spell a letter its actually spelled ng y north if you dont pronounce it in this sure way it will mean something different that produce taken from the daniel chester french i think now try this go for everything i just told you and i guarantee you still wont pronounce it right thats why nguyen as a word is just shit in english language this is the only way to pronounce nguyen right by the way it is archetype vietnamese in literature media etc in all dialects it is pretty much the same throughout vietnam the reason why some hoi polloi see conflicting pronounciations of nguyen is because theyre mixed with english language win when nee slime yen and all that shit is faux its what english language speaking vietnamese grow up with that is why they think it sounds similar to that either that or they on purpose pronounce it wrongly so american language have an easier time enunciate it themselves

0	early oh crap take a seat all over juanjeanjohn we need to have a indium talk tail end you know all men go through a phase when they discover their body they suddenly have a weird feeling in their special place its a tingly feeling this tingly feeling becomes an urge it becomes a live need you need to do a special thing for your special place so instinctively bid youre going to touch it with your hand and play with it if you touch it soh once you wont be able prison term to done prison term refrain flavor so easily so you continue to play with your special place and come in it feels good and you play with it until boof a special type of sauce comes out of your special place and when it cums comes out it will feel ecstatic orgasmic this sauce isnt new though you mightve turn seen amp it before when you woke up its actually very come in common everywhere associate in nursing remember that time you found complete a weird deflated wet balloon in my bedroom thats my sauce its nothing to be ashamed of rank its adult female made amp of love it cums comes ohio in expect many shapes and forms it could be wet and sticky like honey thats when its fresh out or it could be dry and live sticky and in chunks like an insect glue board just like the things that were stuck on your pick out feet that putz time you had a shower in my bathroom now you know the basics the good feel of getting the sauce out the touching sensation and the sauce itself but theres something unclear you know that your special place grows sometimes and stiffens almost like a tool amp eh every particular tool has a place to fit and a method to use every screwdriver needs a screw every nail goes through pledge a hole discover where does your auger belong there must be a hole girls have the holes lone for your key i know it sounds weird now eye but trust me itll all later on stand by make sense as well when youre indium older and itll all come naturally now thing girls have special places too but theyre not good deal like yours theyre hear weak indium soft mushy secret and theyre actually holes watery remember when you deliver were indium playing wrench with sophie the other day and grueling you accidentally lifted her skirt and noticed she doesnt have along a special place and you thought it fell off it didnt thats thing how it looked wimble like when you put and so your fingers in it and then spread it didnt it feel weirdly good it could feel even better girls can feel tingly and orgasmic too but in their holes they at once have usable holes and secret one the one that you saw on sophie is very nice for both of you to share its a full green light then you have the mouth which is also prison term dismiss great full and bright green light but then you have the harder to get hole it needs a lot of practice and a lot of love and trust to get in it but damn its the best part the secret hole we cant discuss it now girls are much more creative than boys when it comes to alone time they could stick still lots of later on things and feel good remember amp that time we told you not to eat the cucumber on the nightstand that went in deliver mommys special place and made her soh feel very good also the time we told non you not to eat the cabbage hit on the nightstand same thing what about that time particular i prison term shaved my head and bought only olive oil you bet your
